"Samsung",5,"I feel so LUCKY to have found this used (phone to us & not used hard at all), phone on line from someone who upgraded and sold this one. My Son liked his old one that finally fell apart after 2.5+ years and didn't want an upgrade!! Thank you Seller, we really appreciate it & your honesty re: said used phone.I recommend this seller very highly & would but from them again!!"
"Samsung",4,"nice phone, nice up grade from my pantach revue. Very clean set up and easy set up. never had an android phone but they are fantastic to say the least. perfect size for surfing and social media. great phone samsung"
"Samsung",5,"Very pleased"
"Samsung",4,"It works good but it goes slow sometimes but its a very good phone I love it"
"Samsung",4,"Great phone to replace my lost phone. The only thing is the volume up button does not work, but I can still go into settings to adjust. Other than that, it does the job until I am eligible to upgrade my phone again.Thaanks!"
"Samsung",1,"I already had a phone with problems... I know it stated it was used, but dang, it did not state that it did not charge. I wish I would have read these comments then I would have not purchased this item.... and its cracked on the side.. damaged goods is what it is.... If trying to charge it another way does not work I am requesting for my money back... AND I WILL GET MY MONEY BACK...SIGNED AN UNHAPPY CUSTOMER...."
"Samsung",2,"The charging port was loose. I got that soldered in. Then needed a new battery as well. $100 later (not including cost of purchase) I have a usable phone. The phone should not have been sold in the state it was in."
"Samsung",2,"Phone looks good but wouldn't stay charged, had to buy new battery. Still couldn't stay charged long.so I trashed it.MONEY lost, never again will I buy from this person! !!!"
"Samsung",5,"I originally was using the Samsung S2 Galaxy for Sprint and wanted to return back to the Samsung EPIC 4G for Sprint because I really missed the keyboard, I really liked the smaller compact size of the phone, and I still needed some of the basic functions of a smart phone (i.e. checking e-mail, getting directions, text messaging) Because the phone is not as powerful as the newer cell phones out there, just be aware that the more applications you install the slower the phone runs and will most likely freeze up from time to time. But the camera works great, the video is great as well, and even the web browsing is decent and gives me what I need. I also notice that battery life lasts a little bit longer and charging the phone is much quicker than my Galaxy S2."
"Samsung",3,"It's battery life is great. It's very responsive to touch. The only issue is that sometimes the screen goes black and you have to press the top button several times to get the screen to re-illuminate."
"Samsung",3,"My fiance had this phone previously, but caused many problems. So, of course, we decided to browse amazon for a replacement til' our contract is up! & so far so good!"
"Samsung",5,"This is a great product it came after two days of ordering it. There was only one little blemish on the side,but who cares as long as the phone is fullly functional.i recommend this product to anyone reading this."
"Samsung",5,"These guys are the best! I had a little situation with my item but they quickly fixed the issue. I was pleased and will definitely be buying another phon from them if I need one."
"Samsung",1,"I'm really disappointed about my phone and service. The phone went out on me over a week ago. Instead of handling it when issue first surfaced. I've been told to do this and do that. Now I'm stick with no phone and I'm out 55 dollars for service that I'm not using. I still haven't received a mailing label to return item. This was my first purchase on amazon. I'm not rushing to use theirs or smartphones 288 business Anytime soon. I thought I was getting a deal but it seems like I'm the one who lucked out."
"Samsung",5,"Ordered this phone as a replacement for the same model until my contract expires and I can get a new one. Seller confirmation said delivery could take up to 7 days. Seller sent out the phone within hours of receiving the order and I had the phone the next day. Phone looks better than described was able to transfer data from the old one to the new one with no problems. Highly recommend this seller"
"Samsung",2,"Had this phone before and loved it but was not working so I got this phone. One thing is the SD card slot does not open up when I try to access it in file managment, even does not show up on the computer. The card is fine was able to open on another phone. Trying to trouble shoot it for now."
"Samsung",5,"I was able to get the phone I previously owned...with a keyboard and touch screen. It's the best phone and I love it. I still had to clean the device with my service provider, but it was well worth it."
"Samsung",5,"I brought this phone as a replacement for my daughter, who is very hard on cell phones. I must say it was a great purchase. The phone work wonderful. Thank you"
"Samsung",4,"I love the phone. It does everything I need and works great. I purchased four of these phones through a seller that shipped from Amazon's warehouse. My only problem is that the phone didn't come with a micro sd card. I couldn't use the camera until I got the card. No problems getting these activated at Sprint."
"Samsung",3,"unfortunately Sprint could not activate the phone due to the blocking issue with the phone, the matter was handled very well and quickly. Very satisfied with the service."
"Samsung",4,"The battery was old & had been over used because it barely holds a charge. Otherwise, no issues with the phone itself."
"Samsung",4,"pros-beautiful screen,capable of running chrome,take good pictures,the keyboard is comfy,fits in my pocket and fit my hands,plays really good videos and gamescons-no Bluetooth,came late,run down fast really quick,doesnt play 1080p videos.but I would still recommend it to those who like to talk and text a lot like me and watch a lot of movies"
"Samsung",1,"I purchased this phone in December as a christmas present to my son. I called sprint to activate the phone only to find out the ESN wasn't clear. I was told to come into the store and upon research the phone wasn't clear. I reached out to this company to inform them that this ESN wasn't clean. I was told to send the phone back and they would send out another phone. I asked the representative to provide me with the ESN # so that I could call and make sure it was clear. I was told that they didn't have to phone available and was guaranteed it would be clear. I should've known something was wrong then. I received a second phone that turned out not have a clear ESN. The representative at Sprint informed me that the seller of these phones are aware the the ESN isn't clear. So once again I had to send another phone back. I asked for a refund for the phone and shipping since the sent me two phones that didn't have a clear ESN. I received my refund for the phone but have yet to see a refund for the shipping. I wouldn't suggest you buy anything from them."
"Samsung",4,"Phone good just a little slow phone old but it's a great phone temporary right now. thank you for the great deal"
"Samsung",4,"Phone's speaker little low. Overall very happy with the phone. I would purchase another cell phone from Chubbietech. I am satisfied."
"Samsung",5,"the phone was great and in good condition. My Daughter is so happy the be a andriod user now !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
"Samsung",3,"the reasons for the 3 star rating was it was in my opinion better than my iphone 4s but it tends to randomly crash, and randomly power off but it is good for storage space, battery usage, and camera"
"Samsung",5,"Phone works great. No problems at all"
"Samsung",1,"was not in good condition but does work good"
"Samsung",1,"Just... not good. The phone has great screen resolution, storage is low, you need an SD card to do anything. May have a clear ESN but don't expect to use it with things like Freedompop."
"Samsung",5,"as described, fast ship!"
"Samsung",5,"Perfect in every way."
"Samsung",2,"One of the phones have a bad charger port. I want to send it back"
"Samsung",5,"Just got this phone and it is a great phone. It's easy to use."

"Nokia",5,"Bought this as an alternative to a smart phone and data plan. I use it with Go-Phone on a pay-as-you-go plan. The phone functions are great. The radio and music players are very good sound quality. The smart phone type features are easier and faster to use than any smart phone I have used. There are some software glitches that are documented on the Nokia support site which proved easily fixed. Even though many of the Nokia based features are no longer supported by Microsoft, you can still use the features needed by accessing the web directly via WIFI connection - or data if you want to pay for the privilege - and launching the site/application from there. Although the new Nokia browser is pretty Spartan in appearance, it is fast and runs with good stability. I am a very big guy with lands large even for my size and I find the full qwerty keyboard to be pretty easy to use. I like the programmable hot keys and on-screen shortcuts. Keeps you from launching items that require data connections by accident. The back lighting is thorough and even and the raised buttons are tactile with a positive click response. The phone does have a few quirks. There is no airplane mode as far as I can tell. The flight profile doesn't seem to be able to be set with the broadcasting and receiving functions turned off. The main navigation button/mouse is a little small and doesn't always respond as expected - that might be me though. All in all I would recommend this phone and vendor highly if you want the features of a smart phone but you don't need GPS or a big data bill every month for a bunch of things you don't need or want to keep you life running smoothly."
"Nokia",5,"muy buen producto"
"Nokia",2,"This phone is trapped in 2001, if you want a simple phone get an old school flip phone. If you want something also for work get a blackberry or somthing new. This isn't even in the middle of those two, it's in another dimension. Nothing but frustration with this phone."
"Nokia",5,"Excellent"
"Nokia",4,"A friend mentioned this phone to me and it worth what he said. Thanks a lot my friend."
"Nokia",5,"Used this unlocked GSM Nokia Asha 302 in the Philippines just recently (Jan-Feb 2015). Excellent, no problem with functionality. Bought a P40 SIM card at the airport & presto! It worked. I passed it on to my brother the instant I came back to the US. He will be visiting the Philippines soon. It was very easy to use. Having been used to smart phones w/ touch screen, I surprised myself when I worked w/ it easily not having read the instructions to operate it. I'll buy another one like this & definitely an upgraded version of this Nokia unlocked GSM phone."

"Nokia",5,"Nokia is the brand that can be used in telephone, good price, excellent team, was a gift to my daughter and she liked it, easy to use and very affordable price, I recommend it."
"Nokia",4,"First off, let me say I've been a Nokia user since I had my first cell phone at age 16, ten years ago. Of course there was that one year where I ventured off into Samsung land but that phone died and back to Nokia I went. But I've always enjoyed Nokia phones.Second, I've been looking for a QWERTY phone with internet/video/mp3 playing capabilities and the Asha 302 fits it. It is a strong build, as I have dropped it numerous times and the phone is still intact. I like the keyboard as I am not a fan of touchscreens at all (which is why I didn't get the Asha 303). As far as sound I think it depends on your headphones. I had earbuds that produced a loudness of 93 decibels which made the listening experience mediocre but then I bought buds with a 110 db loudness and the sound is much better. Nokia Xpress is a bit sucky but I downloaded an Opera browser for the phone and it works slightly better so internet experience is pretty easy. I won't get into video games and SNS because I don't even do that on my PC so I don't have a reason to use it on my phone.My only wish is that the 302 had a built in antenna so I could listen to re radio without RDS earbuds. Other than that, it's a really great phone and for those who want to move up into Blackberrys but don't want to pay so much the Nokia Asha 302 is a great phone to start with.EDIT (October 3, 2013): I found a Gino 25cm 4 Section Telescoping Stainless Steel AM FM Radio Antenna 3.5mm Plug to use for playing the radio through the speaker. So now I'm really enjoying the phone for when I'm sitting outside with friends or at my desk."
"Nokia",5,"Nokia Asha 302 Unlocked GSM Phone with 3.2MP Camera, Video, QWERTYDependableTraditional Nokia Menu'sNot Complicated like 'Smart Phones'DurableEasy to use on Straighttalk, Internet, WiFi, Bluetooth."
"Nokia",5,"This is a solidly-built unlocked phone that is an update to the popular Nokia C3. It runs the S40 software which has its goods and bads. It has good reception and nice audio. The 3g supports 850 and 1900 bands (AT&T and T-mobile when it's hspa is refarmed from 1700/2100 to the 1900 pcs band.) + the 2100 band.The keyboard is pretty good, not as firm as other Nokia qwerty phones (e.g. E5), but comparable to the C3 keyboard. The one that I have is obviously for the world market, since it has some added European chars and symbols on the keypad. Wi-fi works fine, and Opera Mini installed and runs without problems - good way to go for a bit of web-surfing. I did not tried any of the e-mail or social clients. Text messaging can be set to 'normal' in-box or conversation modes. OVI store app does not seem to work that well. There are a couple of features that I found appealing: ability to backup the phone memory to the sd card; ability to lock the keypad with a passcode either manually or automatically after a set time. The battery is fairly good sized (BL-5J). The 'function' keys and the d-pad keys can all be re-assigned to user defined short-cuts. My opinion: it is a worthy update (3g) to the C3, not quite in the same league as the more expensive E5 which has the multi-tasking S60 software. For the price of around $110, it is an unlocked feature (gsm/3g) phone well worth considering, as long as one knows that one is getting a non-smart phone and that apps for S40 is very limited."
"Nokia",1,"Hola, compramos dos teléfonos y vienieron totalente diferentes, uno vino con la batería dañada, se descarga de inmediato. El otro teléfono vino sin la tarjeta de memoria y los teclados y cargadores son muy distintos.Mi Tía y yo nos sentimos engañadas y defraudadas :("
"Nokia",5,"THIS CELLPHONE IS VERY EASY FOR USING, IT HAS COMPLETE APPS FOR THE MOST IMPORTANT CONTACT WITH OTHER PEOPLE, MOST OF THEM ARE INCORPORATED AND I JUST HAD TO USE IT WITH WI FI CONNECTION, I AM SATISFIED WITH THIS PURCHASED IT IS A SIMPLE PHONE BUT COMPLETE AND IT IS THE MOST IMPORTANT..."
"Nokia",5,"GRACIAS ME LLEGO EL PROCTO QUE COMPRE Y LLEVO EN EL MOMENTO INDICADO Y EN UN BUEN ENVALAJE LO RECOMIENDO SASTIFACTORIAMENTE.."
"Nokia",4,"Freezes alot. But i bought primarily for playing back my music instead of my BB. Its a great phone for SMS and rings really loud. The body is strong and neat"
"Nokia",4,"The keys are a little hard to hit, and I didn't expect a Spanish keyboard. But overall, a very good phone."
"Nokia",2,"Preface: This is not what would be considered a smartphone in the United States (Nothing on the par of Android, iPhone, or Windows Phone), it is basically a feature phone. Also, although it says here that it has a US warranty all of the warranty material it came with referenced Latin American countries so I am not sure if it is really covered under a US Warranty. I returned it during Amazon's return window so it wasn't an issue. Now for the phone review.Pros: The phone has a great keyboard. If you are familiar with the E-series phones its that type of keyboard. The interface is some sort of modified Symbian and I liked it in a lot of ways. The style of the hardware is attractive and the Gray is a nice color. The camera was pretty decent considering it is only 2 megapixels. For e-mail it's adequate.Cons: I'll start with the small issues and work up to the big problem that ultimately made me decide to return the phone. The onboard social network apps are not fully functional. You can update your Facebook or Twitter status but the rest of it is so-so. The Ovi store in general is a poor app store, but this phone isn't able to use many of them. Even the old Facebook app that I used on my old E71 (It used to be called Snaptu but Facebook has since renamed it to Facebook for Everyone) is incompatible with this phone as are most of the better apps in the Ovi store. The browser was mediocre, barely passable. Also, NO GPS for this phone. Nokia/Ovi Maps is incompatible which is too bad because that has always been a Nokia strength. That immediately eliminates this phone as a smart phone. With all of that said, I bought this phone for my wife and she really only needed a phone for texts and calls so we could have overlooked these things. The problem we could not overlook was the very shabby, flimsy piece of metal that was supposed to hold in place the standard sim card. This little piece of metal was barely attached to the phone and would not lock into place to hold down the sim card. Because the sim card would intermittently get lose inside the phone and constantly lose the signal. So we would have to take the battery out and re-adjust the sim card. Then it would work for a little while only to ultimately have to repeat the process. It was WAY more frustration than it was worth. It's too bad because as a basic phone for calls, texts, e-mail, and occasionally updating your Facebook/Twitter status; this phone has a lot of potential. Becuase of the problem with the sim card holder, however, it was essentially unusable. I have used Nokia phones for years (I use a Lumia 710 personally) and I am really surprised Nokia would do such a sloppy job on something as important as the part that holds the sim card in place. What a waste."
"Nokia",5,"We just received the phone a few days ago. Put in the Consumer Cellular SIM card, and it is ready to go. The phone seems very nice even though we have not come close to discovering all of the things it will do. It has a large number of ring tones built in."
"Nokia",5,"I bought this phone as a Christmas present for myself because I wanted something a bit more advanced than the Nokia C2 I purchased from Amazon in 2012, but didn't want to go all the way with a smartphone. In other words, a good feature phone with smartphone features without the touch screen. Red, however, is my favorite color, but I went for the white one because my C2 is silver and I couldn't find a silver Asha 302 on Amazon. I've had it for a week and it works great. Best is the Wi-Fi feature, which gives you access to the Web without purchasing a data plan (which I may have to do if I want to access personal email or go on Facebook). It has the great calendar, alarm clock, text messaging, camera, missed/received call and other features of the C2, which makes it a keeper. And it's a little bigger, with a wider screen, but not so big it can't fit into my pocket or purse. I can use the same Nokia charger I had for the C2. Now all I have to do is await the arrival of my purple phone skin, then I'll be all right. I've had Nokia phones since 1999 and they've never let me down - just get better!"
"Nokia",4,"The Phone is pretty good. I am using it with a LycaMobile plan. Only thing that is awkward is that the bottom row of letters is off compared to other phones and devices. Before this I had been using a blackberry. When trying to type on the nokia I am always mistyping Ms, Ns and espectially the shift key (which you need to hit to insert any punctuation)"
"Nokia",5,"loved everything about it. also it looks like any other touch phone but is not. which makes it stylish yet classic."
"Nokia",5,"THIS IS A SOLUTION IF YOU WANT YOU ARE LOOKING FOR ECONOMIC AND NOT VERY SOPHISTICATED. YOUR PRICE IS A GOOD CHOICE FOR THE PRODUCT THAT RECEIVE.rECOMMEND IT"
"Nokia",5,"This phone in an excellent phone at a great price. I was impressed with the features of this phone and would recommend this to anyone."
"Nokia",3,"Have problems setting correct time on Nokia Asha 302. Customer support on Nokia.com does not accept inquiry about Asha 302 phones. Is this product obsolete, or is Nokia customer support poor? Booklet that came with phone is also poorly written."
"Nokia",4,"This is a good phone although it seems to have a small screen. However, it's capable of performing all the basic functions such as calling, messaging, web browsing, social networking and it also has a wi-fi capability."
"Nokia",5,"I've been a long time user of the iPhone. I finally got sick of it and sold it. I just wanted a simple phone. After going through about 3 of them, this fits the bill very well. The texting interface is very nice and intuitive. The battery life is stellar. It connects to the internet just fine. I can check my email in case of emergency, look up directions, etc. Basically everything I was able to do with my smartphone, without the bells and whistles. Having a physical keyboard is quite nice too. The OS seems very stable and snappy. You have things like calendar, todo, memos, etc.Backup is a snap. Just insert an SD card and go to Settings to back it up. No more iTunes! If you want to add music or podcasts, just plug it into the computer, copy paste to the SD card and you're done.I would buy this phone again definitely if I broke or lost it."
"Nokia",5,"This phone, like all of Nokia's feature phones, are great for their value and durability. The last phone I had before buying this one was a Nokia C-3, which was also a great phone. It lasted for years, and probably would have kept going if I hadn't accidentally jumped into a pool with it in my pocket :P This phone is basically an update of the C-3. It is sleek and small, has a full QWERTY keyboard, and has Wi-Fi internet browsing. This is the best phone you can get if you're looking for functionality, but don't want to throw hundreds of dollars at a smartphone with a data plan.And the buyer should be aware; this is NOT a smartphone. If you're looking for anything like a smartphone, you will be disappointed. If you're looking for a toy you can take out of your pocket every couple of minutes to tinker around with, you will be disappointed. Yes, it does have an internet browser which works well, but the screen is quite small so it's not good for recreational browsing. I just use it to look things up, it works fine for that. It also has some social network apps, but I don't use them. I don't know how well they work, but if that's a priority for you this phone probably isn't the best choice. Same goes for the camera; I don't use it, can't speak to its quality, but if a camera is important to you this isn't the best choice.The only other potential negative I can see in this phone is that the keys really are pretty small. I haven't had an issue with them personally, but if someone has big hands I see how this could be annoying.I bought this phone for the advantages to NOT owning a smartphone: longer battery life, higher durability, lower cost, but still good at accomplishing what it needs to. If you're looking for the same thing, Nokia is definitely the best way to go."
"Nokia",5,"Love it."
"Nokia",2,"Sorry it took so long to Reply or Review this purchase as it over 18 months.This Phone was a Clone Phone from Hong Kong--The quality is Fair--ALL THE SYMBOLS DON'T MATCH--such as \ ? !--But the phone works I think amazon should Boycott this Seller."

"Nokia",5,"Excellent phone, for adults recommend. . WhatsApp, Internet , app, radio, keyboard qwerty easy for use. Display big visualiser. Funny"
"Nokia",5,"I have enjoyed my Nokia C3 phone for a few years, but it was tired and needed an update. This Asha 302 phone is just that - all of the Symbian S40 simple goodness, with a much higher quality set of hardware. The screen is sharper, processor faster, phone takes nice clear pictures that are pretty much good enough, the ring and alert tones are more discreet and professional. The internet and mail stuff is actually useable on T-Mobile's 3.5G network and requires very little data to stay connected on a minumal plan. Strangely, I cannot it do wifi yet ... it receives the signal but just insists on using network data or nothing at all. Probably a setting in the menu I have not toggled to the right setting. Anyway - if you want a phone that texts very easily, has a 4-day battery, a very convenient and useable features, and yet not crack open the crack-pipe of the internet constanly, the Asha 302 does it with style and then some. I may get myself another one or two for the future, as I bet this is the end-run for this type of practical phone."
"HTM",5,"exelente"
"HTM",5,"phone works great for the price although when we got it by UPS the UPS guy just dropped it between the screen door and our big door"
"HTM",5,"Keeping in mind that this is a sub $100 phone that has generally been advertised as the ""cheapest quad-core phone,"" the Landvo L800 has turned out to be a good phone that has exceeded my expectations. From all my research, Landvo seems to be a new company and the L800 was their first model which they released in March of 2014. I took a risk (although less than $100 isn't a huge risk) in buying this in April with no reviews available. The main thing I was looking for was the most powerful, inexpensive phone at the $100 price point. Battery life was also a major factor. So I purchased this phone on the basis of being the only phone in the price range at the time with a quadcore processor and also because it sports a 2300mah battery which was about the largest battery at the price point of the available models.There were a lot of things I immediately liked about the phone. Despite the low resolution and lack of IPS, the screen is pretty crisp and the viewing angles are more than decent. The battery life has also been good--as I have been averaging two days of average use on a full charge. One day of heavy use would usually put me around the 30% range which still isn't bad. I also was almost shocked by the build quality. The phone is heavier than most name-brand competition in its size class but it has a weighty, solid feel too it. The sides are metal, as are the volume rocker and power button. There are no creaks and everything fits together tightly. Fit and finish is top notch. I believe the screen is plastic and not glass, however. Their are pros and cons to this as a plastic screen is susceptible to scratching. However, it does mean that I will never have to worry about a cracked screen if I drop the phone. The phone came with a screen protector prefitted on the phone and an additional one in the box. The included silicone case is relatively simple but was also a nice touch, especially owing to the fact that a no-name brand phone is unlikely to have third party support for cases and such.However, I would not have recommended this phone to anyone at the time. Why? Because performance was lackluster. The quadcore SoC is quite snappy however, the small 512mb of ram was suffering on Android 4.2.2. I was wary of purchasing a phone with less than 1gb of ram and I was regretting it at this point. It would freeze and stutter during even the simplest tasks such as hammering out a text. I put forth my best efforts to streamline my system as much as possible to keep it running smoothly but the fact was it just didn't have enough ram to power Android comfortably. I was ready to ditch the phone for something new.I have completely changed my tune, however, and wouldn't hesitate to recommend this phone in a heartbeat. Why? Surprisingly, Landvo has supported with releasing an official 4.4 KitKat rom for the phone. For those who are tech savvy, this is a boon. KitKat was actually streamlined by Google so that devices with only 512mb of ram can run it comfortably (4.2 was a bit of a resource hog). At this point, I figured I had nothing to lose--I was planning on dumping the phone anyways. Needless to say, flashing to KitKat made a world of difference. The performance is literally night and day as upgrading to 4.4 literally got rid of *all* the lag I was experiencing with the phone. It is now quite fast--I would argue faster than my Sero 7 Pro tablet which is running the old but venerable Tegra 3 processor. Demanding, apps load quickly without stuttering. Animations are smooth and everything has become a joy to use with this phone.If you are looking for a ridiculously cheap, but fast 5.0"" Android phone with good battery life and good build quality, this is the one you are looking for hands down. It's not going to compete with TOTL phones out there but for a measly $95, you shouldn't be expecting that. What you get is a perfectly usable phone at an almost throw away price. I've noticed vendors selling the L800 with Android 4.4 already installed so it looks like the new stock of this phone has been upgraded. If you are not tech savvy and comfortable with flashing your phone, make sure you purchase one with 4.4 already installed! You will love it if you do."
"HTM",5,"Is a good product That I recomended it has all you will need, it's fast good looking very good,thank you"
"HTM",5,"my autistic son is in his glory lol thank you again"
"HTM",4,"All around good phone, not glitchy at all, or laggy. There are a fee problems such as the storage being very small (only 2gb) and the camera is very poor quality. I'm pretty certain that you can buy a Galaxy S 4 camera and install it to this phone. But all around this is a pretty great phone!"
"HTM",4,"I have no problem taking the phone to straight talk.The phone came in about 3weeks. The only thing I didn't like was the camera its horrible when trying to get a take picture the pictures wasn't clear"
"HTM",2,"Delivery was fast. The overall quality of the phone is just like the price very cheap. Not a good quality camera so that is one feature I do not use at all and also not very durable my screen was damaged from a 3 inch drop. However I do suppose you get what you pay for but after only having it for a month I am very willing to just buy a real phone and lose this terrible one."
"HTM",5,"Perfect"
"HTM",1,"Worked OK for awhile now every time I tap the back it shuts off"
"HTM",5,"Great phone. My sone has been happy with it. Needed to get an extra micro-SD card for more storage."
"HTM",3,"Valid for Movilnet in Venezuela, low memory, bad camera, low price, great!!"
"HTM",5,"very good, excellent"
"HTM",2,"When I first got the phone it had a very poor camera and one day I hit my phone with a pencil and it turned off immediately. I do not like the phone whatsoever. I would not recommend getting this phone, especially if you like to take a lot of pictures or use a lot of apps. The storage is also very poor."
"HTM",5,"Cheap and fast"
"HTM",3,"The phone works great but my charger outlet on phone is having to be fixed and the one they sent falls out and my phone doesnt charge with it. It will cost 55 dollars to have charger fixed before it messes the motherboard up. Thats almost as much as phone"
"HTM",5,"very good cell"
"HTM",5,"very responsible seller and excellent product"
"HTM",4,"MUY BUENO"
"HTM",5,"fino fino"
"HTM",5,"exelentes equipos en lenguaje criollo son una verdaderas naves"
"HTM",5,"Good"
"HTM",4,"Its great for the price but I hate how you can not change the lock screen to what you wantAnd just has the default wallpapers for your lockscreen"
"HTM",5,"When I got new Phone. I loved this phone. but with Android 4.2.2 it very small limited and would not let you set in SD Card where you want it. So may have to upgrade new Android 4.4 I heard they work better. I have not figure out with my. as I using Straight Talk I have no problem setting in Straight Talk APN setting. So Far I want to find better Protection case for this. I have not found what I like. Hopefully they do make one for this phone."
"Jethro",2,"I like the FM radio feature and charge cradle, but I switched back to a LG 450 flip phone that cost $20 less from best buyReception in weak signal areas not as good as the LG 450. Phone was on T-mobile networkbacklighting uneven on keypad. The number 9 is really bright on my phone.User manual is too small for a phone designed for older people. The manual is about the same size as the phone, so it fits in a small box for shipping. Manual doesn't explain the use of each button in a clear concise way.I couldn't get the alarm to repeat daily. Turning alarm off would cancel alarm for next day."
"Jethro",5,"I bouht this phone for my 82 year old mother who has macular degeneration, she loves it. It is very easy and she can see the big numbers for dialing and such."
"Jethro",5,"like your ad...love it!"
"Jethro",3,"the charger did not work. My parents started using the cable directly to the phone"
"Jethro",5,"Have a family member who has ZERO interest in learning anything tech. Years ago gave her an old T-Mobile pre paid flip phone. I had kept it for years as a backup phone. To her it was perfect. She did not want to learn anything else. Problem was the phone and buttons were very small and getting hard for her. Ordered this and put her SIM in it and away it went. She loves it. It will do a lot of extra stuff if she ever decides she wants to learn. For now she loves how much larger the buttons are. Just dead simple to use which is all she wants."
"Jethro",5,"good quality phone"
"Jethro",2,"does not work well with T-Mobile. T-Mobile closes off some towers to non-T-Mobile phones."
"Jethro",5,"Screen size is good and easy to read. Sound could be a little louder but is okay. Settings are a little cryptic but get the job done with a few extra key stokes than really needed. I don't care for the way they setup the texting where you have to hit a button twice to get a capital letter then hit it again to turn off capitals. My other brand phone automatically capitalized the first letter after a period but this one does not. Still a good phone though and worth the money."
"Jethro",5,"This is like the 5th cellphone for my dad in less than a year. My dad always does all type of heavy labour work and in the process he always ends up destroying it in the process. Well my first impressions as i recieved the cellphone in the mail is the keypad. I really like that the numbers are huge and also the display is quite clear and crispy and simple to understand. He had no problem adjusting to this new device.It has a FM radio which does not need headphones to work it has a camera which is OK not the best but plausible. It has an SD slot for media. But it cannot play music nor the videos files they dont show up when i try search the folders in the memory. I like that it has an LED light to alert him of any notifications which is a plus and the ringtones are pretty loud too. Good pick for aging parents."
"Jethro",5,"This is a really great phone. I am visually impaired and have no problem with it. Will be getting another one for my partner."
"Jethro",1,"More complicated than I expected. Terrible reception. Too hard for my mom to use. Just frustrates her."
"Jethro",3,"No internet"
"Jethro",1,"phone reception poor with incoming calls"
"Jethro",4,"Nice phone. Easy to read screen. I am a senior and not a tech so the learning curve was steep. The support at Jethro, however, made it easy. They were knowledgeable, easy to understand, patient, and so willing to help that I would recommend the phone because of them. The SOS button is a good feature and with my limited use as a telephone it is a much less expensive tool than a Life Line.."
"Jethro",5,"The sleek design and easy of use is what makes this phone really good. The large text is a plus"
"Jethro",5,"My husband loves it!! It is simple to use with large numbers. The simpler the better for him."
"Jethro",3,"The only reason I gave it a 3 star is because it is a little hard for a elder person to use."
"Jethro",5,"Even the instruction book is better than any I have ever had, but as a senior we need BIG print with the phone, not for your website as page 1 clearly tells us because seniors take instructions with them as we go places, especially traveling and there is not a computer readily at hand, remember we are not the laptop generation, just getting into tablets and they are often to small. Otherwise, so far so GREAT. Love the name, I ask my brother, do you have Jethro, when he is leaving."
"Jethro",5,"This phone was purchased for my father. I really like the features and for the price it is an excellent deal. It took me exactly 1 month to get everything working on the phone but the issue was not the phone it was me (my first unlocked phone) and Consumer Cellular. The manual that came with the phone is not that good and some things in the manual do not match the phone.I received a lot of help from Jethro. Jeffrey from Jethro is a godsend. He was extremely helpful and always had a cheerful voice. He called me, he sent me pictures, etc. He did whatever it took to help me with my issues even though it was obvious the problem was not on Jethro's end.I really like the phone but the 5 stars are for Jeffrey. I hope Jethro realizes what a great employee they have in him."
"Jethro",5,"works good for 3G and above. Simple to use. No frills."
"Jethro",5,"Simple. Sleek. Minimalist. Accepts any Sim. The perfect back-up phone. Nice matte finish. Pretty emerald green notification light. A few cool alarms/ringtones.What could be improved:- Very limited space for messages. Will stop accepting txts after about 30. Even adding an SD card didn't help, so it wasn't programmed to utilize it for messages.- Camera worse than security footage. Why even bother?- Menu structure not intuitive."
"Jethro",2,"Sounds like you are under water. It shuts off while you are on call."
"Jethro",1,"I was contacting Jethro customer service, because a couple of keys were sticking. As I was speaking the rep noticed I was breaking up to much, so he told me the phone was a 2G..and most likely did not work well in my area. So he was kind enough to send be a 3.5G phone model SC-628..This one seems to be working fine...so far but I must say it was the best customer service response to solve the issue...."
"Jethro",5,"[New Edition] Jethro [SC213V2] Flip Quad-band Unlocked GSM Senior & Kids Cell Phone, SOS Emergency Button, 2.4"" Large LCD with Large Keypad.A a nice phone, easy to operate and cost friendly. Its also light and so easily portable. You can use your micro sim and save your music and photos."
"Jethro",5,"everything was great. had a hard time getting the old SIM card to work with it, but Verizon hooked me up"
"Jethro",3,"good phone for my 82 year old dad who wanted a camera, but probably wouldn't be able to deal with an iphone. Needs a memory card for the camera to work though. It's nice you can set speed dials."
"Jethro",1,"Bought this phone because it was supposedly able to work with Straighttalk or Tracfone. We put a Tracfone SIM card on board, bought a 30 buck Straighttalk minutes card, then discovered it is not compatible with Straighttalk and ther local Wally World wants at least 60 bucks for a SIM card kit that will work--supposedly. My daughter worked with it for about an hour and called every available number. No good. She is expert with today's high tech. The cheaper Tracfone card is available, and I'll ask my daughter to take another try when she has time, but she has her own job and family to take care of. As another point, the only way the manual is of any use at all is to download it as a PDF and print the regular pages. Otherwise, it's +3 readers and a 3 strength magnifying glass. No, I wouldn't recommend this to anyone, but most particularly not for other elderly people (I'm ready to turn 78)."
"Jethro",5,"Met expectations, easy to use, gave as gift veto elderly relative. She loves it."
"Jethro",5,"I bought this phone for my 91 year old aunt. It seems very easy for to use. Would certainly recommend it. Purchased another brand senior phone same price that didn't last 2 weeks due to quality of phone screen"
"Jethro",5,"I received my product."
"Jethro",5,"Good phone for elderly people."
"Jethro",5,"Bought for my mom! She loves it!"
"Jethro",1,"I searched for unlocked flip phones 3D because my old T-Mobil no longer works in my house.This looks good BUT the only 3D capability is in its second minisim.I NEED SIMPLICITY - I have a husband that can barely ANSWER a flip phone let alone use this and I have NO desire to buy a mini sim.I believe this was badly described. The manual is in bad English and seems to be for a different phone."
"Jethro",3,"Not as sensitive as our track phone, but the Jethro is easier to read ."
"Jethro",1,"I am very unhappy with the purchase. First of all I paid to have it shipped to me and then once I received it I found out from Staight talk that after 1/1/2017 that it would no longer work with ATT which is the only cell phone carrier that is my area. I was able to send it back but I have to pay the postage. I am not happy. Ken"
"Jethro",5,"I am a computer programmer, but I have to admit that I never made the transition to smartphone, mainly because I sit in from of a computer everyday anyway. If I need access to all those smartphone apps, I just use my laptop! Besides, the screens are tiny and I am farsighted, so that means if I use a smartphone, I am going to have to carry even more items: reading glasses.But I am an adventurous type, biking, motorcycling, hang gliding, scuba, etc. and could find myself in need of assistance during one of these risky adventures. And I do live alone and might need to get help in a car breakdown or a home injury situation. So I bought one of those pre-paid cells and thought, there you go that's problem is solved. No it wasn't. I kept pocket dialing. I couldn't see the screen either. But worse thing was the battery would go dead on me every few days. Since I never used the cell phone except for emergencies, I would always always forget to charge it. So a prepaid didn't work as my emergency phone.Jethro solved the problem. It is a big screen clamshell that is about as inexpensive as a pre-paid, but soooo much more useful. Because it is a clamshell, I get no more pocket dialing. Because it is a big screen, I don't have to carry reading glasses around. I am actually using it a little for taking TODO notes and using the calculator, as well as its great FM radio and flashlight. And its battery lasts more than a week in standby mode! Honestly, I haven't used it yet for a real emergency phone call yet (but I placed several test calls - works great) , but Jethro took my pre-paid T-Mobile SIM with no problems and I was up and running in a few minutes.So if you need a cellphone you can throw in your backpack or glove box in case of emergency, this is it. Plus it is inexpensive, so if you break or lose it, then ""No Biggie""."
"Jethro",5,"Fast shipping, and accurate description"
"Jethro",2,"the phone is unable to maintain signal after 2 weeks of usage on the TMobile network. I hope it is a defected product"
"Jethro",5,"Great phone."
"Jethro",1,"Shortly after return window closed, stopped taking a charge and will not turn on."
"Jethro",1,"Stopped working after 2 months. Not happy with this phone."
"Jethro",1,"Defective product. I have placed my T-Mobile SIM card in the phone but it will not read it. I do NOT recommend purchasing this phone."
"Jethro",2,"sound quality poor, no speaker phone"
"Jethro",5,"Great phone!"
"Jethro",5,"Excelente"
"Jethro",5,"this phone met all our expectations, my dad loved it and is enjoying it!"
"Jethro",3,"This may be an issue of expectation mismatch. For one thing, the phone is much smaller than I expected. Some might think this is a good thing. But for many elderly and hearing aid equipped people, it would work better if the physical dimensions were larger. Secondly, the time to hold the red button for turning the phone off is too short. My 90 year old mother in law often turns the phone off when she is hanging up.That being said, the phone works fine. The buttons and numbers are large."
"Jethro",5,"I bought it for my elderly grandfather which is very vocal about everything we get him whether we like it or not. He likes the phone it's loud and it's simple. He doesn't need his glasses to use it. I was able to sync it with AT&T"
"Jethro",5,"Just what we needed for an older relative."
"Jethro",5,"It was a gift for my Grandma in South America and she loved it thanks!"
"Jethro",2,"The speakers are garbage and it only tells time in military time"
"Jethro",1,"I bought this phone for my elderly parent. He has At&t, I did put the SIM card from his At&t phone in the Jethro, it worked. The only Problem he was having was dropped calls. He would receive or make a phone call and the phone would hang up on the person on the other line. I'm asking for a refund. It wasn't his carrier, it's the phone. He had 3 or 4 bars when the phone calls took place."
"Jethro",4,"This is a great, simple phone which is getting to be harder and harder to find. For those who do NOT want a smartphone and just need a phone for an elderly family member or for someone who is not tech savvy, this is a great little phone. I gave it four stars, though because our carrier - AT&T - does not recognize the signature of this phone, so we wound up having to buy an AT&T friendly phone. The phone works, but when we are billed their system would automatically charge this as a smartphone - which is an extra $40 on our bill - since it did not recognize the signature :/ We will be giving it to the military to reuse."
"Jethro",2,"My Granny couldn't use the phone because she wasn't able to use the locking the phone function, and without the lock the phone called people when the phone was in her pocket. If the lock was easier for her, then this phone would be great."
"Jethro",2,"Not good sound, not easily used by senior, end button is also turn off button...so my elderly mom keeps turning off the phone!Will have to find her another one..,would not purchase this again.The purchase and delivery were as scheduled."
"Jethro",5,"really surprised by this phone, with fm radio and a flashlight and the SOS feature is nice as well for my mom"
"Jethro",5,"Nice big numbers everywhere! Simple too!"
"Jethro",1,"Ordered phone but it would not work with AT&T. Called company and told it was due to lack of towers. Found that odd since my cell is at&t"
"Jethro",5,"As good as you can hope for in a phone for seniors. Reminiscent of a cordless house phone -- makes it easy to use for an 84-year-old. Buttons light up bright, ringtone volume is adjustable and on max it's more than loud enough for anyone with a hearing problem; though surprisingly the call volume is not adjustable, though it is louder than the previous Verizon flip phone on max volume. I set this up with Cricket service. The phone takes a MINI SIM CARD. Not a micro as someone else has stated. I had to buy another sim card because the micro I ordered was too small. Mini sims are the original, large cards. We live in the US. I don't know people are claiming this phone doesn't work in the US. I paid 30ish for this phone, but would have paid up to 100 for it because of the design and functionality. Side note: I was concerned that my grandmother would always accidentally hit the SOS button this phone has, but it can be disabled in the settings."
"Jethro",5,"Good"
"Jethro",5,"Thank you"
"Jethro",4,"easy to use. My mother is 78 but she can use it very well."
"Jethro",3,"Word to the wise: Check with the seller for the type of service this phone does NOT work with if you are technically challenged like I am. I learned something new - ""unlocked"" is not ""unlocked"" for all mobile service carriers, like Sprint. It would have been helpful to read that in the product description before purchasing. It seems like a perfect phone for seniors. Apparently I was having a senior moment when I ordered it."
"Jethro",2,"The SIM card from the provider would not work in this phone, so I am returning the phone."
"Jethro",5,"Purchased this phone for my parents who have difficulties with the small buttons on other phones. Thanks to the size of the buttons and the display, no more squinting! Also love that the keys are raised. Menu and layout also simple to use. The 5 programmable numbers makes it easy to just call their most frequently used numbers. Ringer volume is good. Would buy it again."
"Jethro",5,"With a little bit of effort I was able to familiarize myself with this phone, and using it became intuitive. It came with a nice easy to read booklet, and before purchasing it I checked to see if it has a web, site which it does. I inserted the sim card and charged the battery which took a couple of hours. I did have several problems at first, but this was my first cell phone so I didn't have much experience. I mistakenly set the language to Portuguese so I couldn't figure out what to do. Luckily there were several online tutorials at the web site and I restored the phone to the factory setting. Once in English I was able to figure the phone out more easily. One thing I figured out was to use military time as in 2pm equal 1400 when setting the time as there was no am or pm setting. All in all I am happy with the phone. Being hearing impaired I am able to hear the basic ring which is loud. When I put it in my pocket I face the keypad to my leg as the speaker comes out the back and it's even louder. Same thing when I set it on the table I put it face down and the ring is loud and clear. I questioned about using a lanyard and e-mailed the Jethro company. They got right back to me and confirmed that a small hole on the upper left side could accommodate a lanyard by removing the back, feeding the lanyard through the hole and looping it around before replacing the back. The customer service was nice and answered my question in an easy to understand manner. The phone will lock in my pocket so it wont random dial. All I need to do is press the * asterisks until the screen says the phone is unlocked, then I can dial out. The phone always accepts a call without turning it on. This is exactly the simple phone I was looking for. I returned several that did not work. I went with this model so I can use it with Consumer Cellular which is less expensive. For $14.25 (with my AARP discount) I get 4 hours of talk per month."
"Jethro",5,"Great simple to use phone for my mother. Big buttons, easy to see and use. She has the use of only one arm so the charge cradle is a great benefit. Easy setup, good clarity, gets good signal."
"Jethro",4,"I bought it for my mom who is in her late 70s after her other highest rated ""senior"" phone stopped working. I hated that other phone as it was very confusing for me to operate the menu functions. So I took a chance on this one despite some of the complaints I read about in the reviews.Some of those problems have been addressed and corrected. It is no longer difficult to lock or unlock the keys. You press the lower left button down for a couple of seconds and the word locked comes up, I assume, since that's what it says in Spanish. I set my mom's phone to Spanish. There is a second way of doing it with a directional key, but we didn't need to try it since my mom got it right away. And she is definitely not good with technology.Another complaint was about the clock being set to military, or 24 hr time. Well, you can now choose to set it to 12 hr.The phone was easy to set, which was a relief for me, compared to her previous phone. Let's face it, it's the non seniors who will probably have to set it up. Sometimes in an effort to simplify phones, they take away buttons which makes them harder to navigate.The phone is very light weight. The ringer is loud enough. I like the cradle, which is easier for a senior. You can't beat the price. It worked well with the SIM card.On the negative side, I will agree with one complaint, it's not loud enough. I turned the volume all the way up and was afraid mom would not be able to hear the caller. She agreed to give it a chance, but we may have to exchange it since her hearing is not great. The back cover is thin plastic and I was afraid to break it when I removed it. I wish it had an alarm.When it comes to ""senior"" phones, it's slim pickings. This one is half the price of the old one and comes close to meeting all the requirements. Since most seniors are hard of hearing, they really need to make it louder."
"Jethro",1,"Returning product. The volume is absolutely abysmal. Even at maximum it is just audible to me. Bought this for my elderly mother: no way will she be able to hear anything ! For a phone marketed for the elderly this is a disgrace."
"Jethro",4,"simple to use. Does not seem to get tiem updates from AT&T"
"Jethro",3,"Phone number comes with DAILY SPAM Calls. Really annoying .. The phone is good."
"Jethro",5,"Perfect, great, inexpensive phone for a senior. Bright, large, backlit numbers, clear controls, large number buttons, light weight, flash light, GSM.For what I paid, about $30, I almost wanted one for myself! Breath of fresh air after smart phones.Good battery life, I really lucked out choosing this and I might buy another one as a backup as my father tends to misplace things.I used it with GIV Mobile - unlimited talk/text and 200mb data for $20/month no contract."
"Jethro",4,"Good phone for my mom, big numbers, however settings are somewhat confusing."
"Jethro",1,"Locks accidentally when used. Screen is too small to read text message. NOT easy to use for an elderly person."
"Jethro",3,"Bought this for my elderly mother. It is pretty nice. It is fairly easy to use. Most importantly, it has large buttons and a fairly large display. It was also easy to add to my AT&T account.A couple of negatives. The SOS button is a nice feature, but is fairly easy to set off. So be prepared for false alarms. Another issue, the phone only displays the time in a 24 hours system. For example, 2:00pm is 14:00. This is extremely confusing for my mother. I bought this phone last Nov. I called Jethro sometime in Dec regarding this and was advised there was a firmware update coming out late Dec / early Jan. I waited until Feb & emailed. Told an update to fix this is time display issue was expected in March and to continue checking back with their support section of their website. I've called & emailed several times regarding this issue and I am told the same thing everytime; a fireware update is coming. It has now been 6 months. Just be advised, the phone only displays time in a 24 hour system."
"Jethro",2,"I bought this phone for my grandma, it doesn't make or receive calls. I tried a manual selection of the network, and also a factory reset, and nothing happened, she has at&t."
"Jethro",5,"It's a good phone for emergencies and the numbers are nice and big. Easy to use. Thank You so much"
"Jethro",4,"but did not work with Iwirless"
"Jethro",4,"Does not have Cyrillic! That was a surprize"
"Jethro",2,"We bought the phone for my 92 year old mother who is hearing impaired. She could not hear well on it at all."
"Jethro",2,"As arrival of this phone and I couldn't charge it its so frustrating"
"Jethro",4,"Looks good, as advertised, instructions not easy to follow. Keys are quite large and fairly easy to see."
"Jethro",5,"My Dad loves it - works great with no confusing bells and whistles"
"Jethro",1,"Very bad same week i bought could not turn on / offNot worth the hassle don't buy it"
"Jethro",4,"Both of my grandmas love it!!! It could have a bigger screen and more ringtones"
"Jethro",5,"It's just what we were looking for"
"Jethro",5,"Mom doesn't like any kind of change, so it has taken some time and effort to get her to embrace this versus her old flip phone."
"Jethro",2,"Pros:* The cradle is nice* Lack of camera* Cheaper than snapfonCons:* The reception is terrible. We have t-mobile and all our phones work inside the house except this one. Apparently it's only 2g which is being phased out. So expect reception to get worse over time.* The time/date was not set automatically. Seriously? What year is this?* Unlike every other phone, the buttons directly under the screen are not actually the navigation buttons, they are M1 and M2 which are speed dials. Probably not a problem if this is someone's first phone, but it drove me nuts.* no FCC id! This phone might be illegal to use in the US.* Poor manufacturing quality - the battery is hard to insert and remove because the battery is slightly too big for the part where it's supposed to fit* The voice mail number has to be programmed. Similar to the time/date, every other phone I've ever had picked this setting up from the network automatically.* As other reviews have mentioned, the hangup button, if pressed for longer than about 1 second, the phone powers off. Easy to accidentally do."
"Jethro",1,"Stopped working after a month of use."
"Jethro",1,"The placement of the M1 and M2 buttons in particular made this too confusing for my elderly father to use. He tried numerous times to get the phone to turn on to make a simple call and could not get it to work. Now it now longer charges or comes on and he has only had it 6 weeks. Fortunately it didn't cost much but what a waste of money."
"Jethro",2,"I bought this phone as a simple option for my 84 year old father. I like the big buttons and the charging cradle. The phone feels cheap. I was afraid I'd break the plastic pieces pulling off the cover to get to the battery and SIM card. We I nstalled 3 different SIM cards from Cricket Wireless (AT&T network) at their store and could not get it connected. Don't know for sure if it's something broken on the phone or just an incompatibility. Other reviewers saying they have connected on AT&T leads me to think something is wrong with the phone. This phone is going back. I'm going to try another brand."
"Jethro",4,"I just not giving 5 stars because I don't know the durability. Everything else are just perfect. I does what it says. Call quality is good. SOS, Speed dial & direct dial works great. Quality of the phone is good. The docking station have some issue but no issue with direct charging, I still rate 4 stars because everything else are just perfect."
"Jethro",5,"Real nice and simple phone for grandma"
"Jethro",4,"This is basic, but has all the features necessary for seniors."
"Jethro",3,"returned would not read sim card."
"Jethro",5,"Great phone for elderly or those not familiar w/ cell phones. Numbers are large,...easier to see."
"Jethro",1,"not working"
"Jethro",3,"My 79 year old mother, who is partially blind, can easily read the numbers on this phone and that is a great thing! However, this phone only supports 2G and therefore does not work with our AT&T Microcell in our house. Since we have limited cell coverage in our house without the Microcell, this phone does not receive a cell signal a majority of the time."
"Jethro",5,"Loving it"
"Jethro",5,"I love this simple handset and the limited number of features I can find on it to get myself into trouble."
"Jethro",2,"This phone is very difficult to unlock. To unlock the phone, you need to press the unlock key 3 times. The first press wakes up the phone, the second press results in a message which says to press the unlock key to unlock. The third press unlocks the phone. There isn't any easier method for unlocking the keyboard without disabling the lock altogether.If you are buying this phone for someone elderly with technology ""issues"" (as we did), they may have a lot of difficulty using this phone. If the three unlock presses aren't done quick enough, the unlock sequence has to be started again. If the unlock key is pressed 4 times, the phone will be locked again instead of being unlocked. All of this is very difficult to explain to someone with dexterity and technology issues.I have never heard of a phone that is this difficult to unlock. It's hard to believe that there isn't an easier method to unlock the phone. However, I have called customer support and they confirmed that the phone does take 3 unlock presses to unlock the phone. The only alternative is to disable the lock feature.On the plus side, the SOS key does work very well and doesn't require one to unlock the keys. The SOS key can be programmed to send text messages and call 911.Another thing to note is that the title for this phone indicates that there is an extra 20% off today. However, they raised the price by about 10% yesterday to $39.99. So, you aren't saving 20%. I hate when companies raise a price just so they can tell you that you are going to save ""more"". I paid the $29.99 ""black friday"" price which was lower than the normal price."
"Jethro",4,"I wish the ring was louder, but can still be heard ok. I am hard of hearing so like everything louder. It is easy to work, and like that not a lot of buttons that can be pushed accidentally. I might buy for a friend. Am wondering if it is compatible with Verizon.Only one problem with setting up. Book says go to settings, but doesn't tell you how to get to settings. If you go to the left 3 utton key and push, it will say phone book. Just keep pushing down arrow and will lead you to settings. Can unlock the phone and set rings."
"Jethro",3,"It worked alright, until i qccidetly pushed the silent button (wich was not explained in miserable chinglish user guide.Then it completely stopped my incoming calls,and icound not reset it."
"Jethro",5,"After reviewing my grandmothers bills I realized she was paying $115 a month for a jitterbug phone with unlimited talk (used 700 minutes a month) & text (never sent one). I bought this phone had AT&T add a no contract line to my plan for $20 a month and gave her this. Works great for her."
"Jethro",3,"Word to the wise: Check with the seller for the type of service this phone does NOT work with if you are technically challenged like I am. I learned something new - ""unlocked"" is not ""unlocked"" for all mobile service carriers, like Sprint. It would have been helpful to read that in the product description before purchasing. It seems like a perfect phone for seniors. Apparently I was having a senior moment when I ordered it."
"Jethro",2,"The SIM card from the provider would not work in this phone, so I am returning the phone."
"Jethro",5,"Purchased this phone for my parents who have difficulties with the small buttons on other phones. Thanks to the size of the buttons and the display, no more squinting! Also love that the keys are raised. Menu and layout also simple to use. The 5 programmable numbers makes it easy to just call their most frequently used numbers. Ringer volume is good. Would buy it again."
"Jethro",5,"Great phone!"
"Jethro",5,"Excelente"
"Jethro",5,"this phone met all our expectations, my dad loved it and is enjoying it!"
"Jethro",3,"This may be an issue of expectation mismatch. For one thing, the phone is much smaller than I expected. Some might think this is a good thing. But for many elderly and hearing aid equipped people, it would work better if the physical dimensions were larger. Secondly, the time to hold the red button for turning the phone off is too short. My 90 year old mother in law often turns the phone off when she is hanging up.That being said, the phone works fine. The buttons and numbers are large."
"Jethro",5,"I bought it for my elderly grandfather which is very vocal about everything we get him whether we like it or not. He likes the phone it's loud and it's simple. He doesn't need his glasses to use it. I was able to sync it with AT&T"
"Jethro",5,"Just what we needed for an older relative."
"Jethro",5,"It was a gift for my Grandma in South America and she loved it thanks!"
"Jethro",2,"The speakers are garbage and it only tells time in military time"
"Jethro",1,"I bought this phone for my elderly parent. He has At&t, I did put the SIM card from his At&t phone in the Jethro, it worked. The only Problem he was having was dropped calls. He would receive or make a phone call and the phone would hang up on the person on the other line. I'm asking for a refund. It wasn't his carrier, it's the phone. He had 3 or 4 bars when the phone calls took place."
"Jethro",4,"This is a great, simple phone which is getting to be harder and harder to find. For those who do NOT want a smartphone and just need a phone for an elderly family member or for someone who is not tech savvy, this is a great little phone. I gave it four stars, though because our carrier - AT&T - does not recognize the signature of this phone, so we wound up having to buy an AT&T friendly phone. The phone works, but when we are billed their system would automatically charge this as a smartphone - which is an extra $40 on our bill - since it did not recognize the signature :/ We will be giving it to the military to reuse."
"e passion",1,"the sim card dose not read so what the point selling a tablet /phone that don't work"
"e passion",1,"This item is not worth the money I paid. cant find where to put memory card. screen isn't clear very blurred, this item sucks"
"e passion",5,"Good phone"
"e passion",1,"The tablet really was not I was looking for the sim card did not work the sd card never read ,charger cord broke,I had to purchase another!!I""m really upset with this product...Really surprise me I wanted a tablet that would do all these things and more"
"e passion",2,"When charging the battery the screen had waves of interference to the point I would not use the tablet while charging. I returned the tablet."
"e passion",4,"It is a little more than ok. I use it on Straighttalk unlimited plan as a 3g phone on AT&T 4g SIM. It has a lot of Chinese apps that you can remove. The viewing angles on screen are not the best. However it looks really sharp straight on. Has excellent quality picture and video (Netflix) . Very Poor Camera!!! Texts to all networks that can be reached by AT&T. I have friends on them all. Is a 4.4.2 android kitty Kat so it can use all the Google apps. The voice search is excellent . If it can decipher my worn out gravely southern accent every time. It should work well for you. Great phone for international travel just pop a European SIM in the extra slot and you are in business. If this phablet had a better camera it would be a steal. The battery will last for days if just used for phone. When you surf and use Wi-Fi continuously you will need to recharge more often. It is going to be kept and used"
"e passion",3,"I AM IN VENEZUELA, THE BATTERY CHARGER IS DAMAGED AND HERE IN VENEZUELA NO WARRANTY THAT BATTERY CHARGER TABLET"
"e passion",2,"This tablet only worked for 4 months, now it is giving trouble to connect to WiFi so i have no play store access. It sucks"
"e passion",5,"Really nice, my daughter uses this everyday and its almost been a year and its still going strong...she loves it"
"e passion",4,"good"
"e passion",5,"Thank's for best supply!!!!"
"e passion",1,"Doesn't have Google Play even though picture and description says it does. I contacted E-passion. They were worse than useless. They kept telling me stupid stuff like install Google Play for the non existent app market. It was very obvious they didn't understand much English."
"e passion",1,"Very upset The tablet did not work. Sending it back. Will be replacing it."
"e passion",5,"Excellent"
"e passion",5,"great phablet for all general uses"
"e passion",3,"Is great i love everything about it."
"e passion",2,"not liked, because the language is in mandarin or HK also I cannot downland any apps from android stores."
"Cedar Tree Technologies",3,"Got this to complete a working scale model office. The little phone actually has a pretty accurate touch screen if I can get my fat fingers to hit only one of those little tiny keys on the keyboard. Probably not bad as a phone for someone with a kid's hands.I can't say that I'm disappointed because I got yellow, and that's what I wanted. But the only color they had in stock was green and I got yellow so drop one star. Also, when I went to put the battery in I discovered THIS PHONE IS NOT RUGGED. The battery cover simply snaps on with no seals to protect against water splashes. So minus another star.All in all its not bad for a $60 smartphone that will not take up much space in the tankbag of your motorbike, or in your hiking bag. But keep it in a zip top bag. If you have a Bluetooth keyboard and mouse, (or can VNC into it like I did) it will be a lot easier to set up."
"Cedar Tree Technologies",1,"arrived broken and forgot to send back"
"Cedar Tree Technologies",1,"this phone is not worth the money. the plastic is flimsy and the phone hardly works. I am trying to return mine now. don't waste your money."
"Cedar Tree Technologies",3,"I like the size of the phone. Whatever happened to the days when we were supposed to make things smaller? I suppose those days are gone with most people ""needing"" to watch YouTube videos in 1080p.This phone has the right size to it, but the internal memory has much to be desired. It also doesn't use the micro SD card slot to move apps over to... I know it can probably be rooted to accomodate for this, but why must it be rooted to install more than one app on here? Isn't there an easier way, like an OTA update or something? I'm not that technically savvy... but I would like to install more than one app on here. After all, this is supposed to be a smart phone.Other than those quirks, I like the phone and use it when my daily driver would be intimidated by mother nature. The speaker can be soft at times, but it works for me.If there are any changes to my review, I'll update when I'm able to."
"Indigi",3,"Is partial internet working,but Indigi is workin on it,hope will be ok"
"Indigi",1,"This is my second sim card I have to use to activated this phone. I contacted the company and still no response. I'm currently doing more research on the matter. To early to rate cause I had this phone for two weeks."
"Phone Baby",5,"This little phone is great compact and easy to use love it .Michelleheraud"

"Indigi",1,"I hate it!!!! I will be sending it back. It keeps blinking on and off. I want my refund back!"
"Indigi",3,"Lots of nice features but touch response slow. Nice looking phone. I only use the phone for one week and I will write review again. Sound volume poor."
"OtterBox",5,"We buy these for work, good price and would be extremely durable for the average person. We do HVAC and we break them a lot not the holster fault."
"OtterBox",5,"They are wonderful. got them for my son as he tends to break them. now we have extras without going through hassle of ordering again!!! thanks for that, that rates 5 stars."
"OtterBox",3,"Does the job but just barely"
"OtterBox",5,"lasting longer than the oem"
"OtterBox",5,"Crear product. Fast arrived."
"OtterBox",3,"Good thing I had order this 3 pack. Poor quality already burned they 2 cases"
"OtterBox",4,"Works great."
"OtterBox",5,"Looks just like the original and I believe it is the original, but a whole lot cheaper."
"OtterBox",4,"these work nice for the price and that is why i bought so many"
"OtterBox",1,"I bought these for my father a little over a month ago, and was just able to give them to him today. When he put his phone in the holsters (all 3 of them) the phone wasn't held securely. He still had his original otterbox holster so we compared them. The phone fits snugly into all of the holsters, basically the same as the otterbox, but the piece that holds the phone in place on the replacement holsters allows the phone to slip out when barely bumped. I would've loved to return them, but my window has passed."
"OtterBox",5,"Great"
"OtterBox",5,"Great value for some one who uses the Otterbox Defender."
"OtterBox",5,"Great buy & service!"
"OtterBox",5,"Work great!"
"OtterBox",5,"I bought the 3 pack and am still on the first one. Seems to be working well and hasn't broke. Holds my phone without all of the bulk of a leather flip case."
"OtterBox",5,"not as thick as my old one but it will do!"
"OtterBox",1,"I purchased the 3 pack a few weeks back and I just broke the third one today. These are brittle and slightly smaller than they need to be to fit a defender case. My last Otterbox clip lasted over a year before it finally broke. I would not recommend this item."
"OtterBox",4,"Other than clip breaks easily. It's ok for the price."
"OtterBox",5,"Fits as advertised."
"OtterBox",5,"Like a number of other reviewers I break these holsters every 3 months or so. Otterbox is good with their warranty but honestly it is a pain ( I get that - there are a lot of knock-offs). Their main competitor is even worse (no names mentioned). I like the Otterbox and have used them on three phones - all had the same issue with holster breakage. So I decided to give these generic holsters a try. I am one month into using them (and have two back-ups) - so far there have been no issues and they appear to look and work as well as the Otterbox brand at a fraction of the cost. If I break all three I will buy three more - easier and faster to get than replacements from Otterbox (not to even mention their ""competitor"". If you are willing to take a chance and ""go generic"" they are a good choice. July 15, 2016 3 1/2 months later - I am still using the first one. It looks like new and works perfectly. I do not treat these gently and am really happy with them thus far."
"OtterBox",4,"Order these every 6 months for my husbands phone. He brakes the clip off theses are A good price and three of them helps keep me from ordering them every other month. They fit his case well and clip to his belt without any problems."
"OtterBox",5,"A++++++++"
"OtterBox",5,"Good product and just as described"
"OtterBox",5,"These seem to be the same as the original at a much lower price."
"OtterBox",5,"My husband breaks his otter box belt clip about every 5 to 6 months, so it was great to get this pack of 3. It fit perfect with his otter box."
"OtterBox",5,"Seems to work fine"
"OtterBox",5,"Look, feel, and fit like the original, but pressed in *China* instead of *Mexico*. No complaints."
"OtterBox",2,"Clearly a knock-off. First one snapped after 2 weeks, but for a couple of bucks each, not unexpected."
"OtterBox",5,"Anybody with Otterbox knows that the belt clips break frequently. These clips last just as long as the brand name but at a much better price. Fast shipment, too."
"OtterBox",1,"you only got me two belt clip and one not functioner properly."
"Lenovo",5,"100% recomendado"
"Huawei",5,"Im happy with my new phone! Its very fast"

"JUNING",4,"So to be put to use by the beneficiary"
"JUNING",1,"Attractive phone but did not work upon arrival. I would not recommend."
"JUNING",5,"This phone works well as how it supposed to be.It has everything you need to make life easier.Its very easy to use,I can surf the Internet fast,listen to music,take photos and videos and many more.The camera is great for taking photos and videos it's pretty clear and it is dual,front and back camera.The sound quality is not that loud but it's not too low either.However it has a Bluetooth so you can just pair it to any Bluetooth speaker if you want to listen to loud music.This phone is enough for your needs compare to the higher prices phones.It is user friendly with a beautiful LCD display.And the best thing is that it's Unlocked,and can put two sim cards(standard sim & micro sim)great phone when traveling to different country.Its also comes with everything,you don't need to purchase the accessories.It comes with:-USB Cable charger-Wall charger-screen protector-clear flexible rubber case-user manualOverall it's a great phone with great features.Recommended.I'm glad to test this for my honest and unbiased feedback and all opinion is mine and it's based of my experienced on the product."
"JUNING",5," The phone is an unlocked phone and the support network of the phone is 3G (WCDMA 850/2100) and 2G Quad Band(GSM 850/900/1800/1900) network ,If you have to buy a sim card buy the GSM/WCDMA SIM card. Do not buy the CDMA SIM card from them.The support language of the phone is English, Bahasa Indonesia, Bahasa Malaya, Burmese, Cestina, Deutsch, Espanola, French, Italiano, Nederland's, Portuguese, Vietnamese, Turkish, Greek, Russian, Hebrew, Arabic, Persian, Thai, Simplified/Traditional Chinese.If your service support those network, and those language, you can use this phone.It supports two different sims cards and a memory card I put a 64 gig memory card in it and it supported it.The internet on this phone is just as fast as 4g I was very impressed with the speed of the phone and clarity.The phone is very well made and durable you will not be disappointed with this phone.I received this phone at no cost/free to test it and try it out in exchange for my honest and unbiased opinion/review of the Juning cell phone."
"JUNING",1,"Cheap-- I am sending it back.."
"JUNING",5,"I bought this to replace my samsung galaxy s3 and this phone has went above an beyond my expectations. It works the same if not better than my Samsung did for more than half the price. I would def purchase again"
"JUNING",5,"My niece is 15 and so hard on phones, my sister has spent a ton of money replacing phones because at 15 years old the right phone matters. I was given the opportunity to try out the Juning 5"" Android phone and passed it along to my niece because I knew it would be perfect for her.Starting with the obvious looks. Just by looks alone, it's amazing. It's Pink and that is something so different than the average phone you can get with a major carrier. It easily resembles a Samsung in size and button placement so she doesn't look ""uncool"" and the screen is BIG which is important as we all know.The phone easily connected to my homes wifi for set up and I was more than impressed with the speed of it. The quad core is very compatible to my iPhone 6s Plus but without the $750 price tag. It is up to date on android and had many features that my niece was looking for including a front facing camera for those snapchat selfies. There is plenty of space to download other apps from the Google play store once you get yourself set up too.It is a dual sim phone but my niece doesn't travel out of the country though if that's of importance to you having that extra SIM card port is amazing.**3G (WCDMA 850/2100) 2G Quad Band (GSM 850/900/1800/1900) **That is the specifics as far as what the phone is compatible with. We have T-Mobile and it worked with no issues or lag straight away when we popped her SIM card in. Keep in mind this is at 3G and 2G speeds, it is in no way compatible with 4G or 4G LTE services but as we all know, most companies throttle our data to 2G after just a few gb and I hardly notice at all. I honestly noticed no lag at all in this phone at 3G or 2G speeds.The phones comes with a charger, earbuds, screen protector and a silicone case. I tried a Samsung lightening charger I had around the house but it didn't fast charge the phone. The ear buds are pretty meh.. Nothing amazing and the silicone case is better than nothing. My niece likes it because it is clear and shows off that she has a very unique pink phone. It seems like it provides better protection than none but I'm not sure where to find others since this is kind of a newer brand of phone.Overall, I'd say this is a great phone. It performs great and. For the price, you really can't beat all the kick you get in this Android phone. I'm an iPhone lover but my son is wanting one of these Junings for himself now too and they come in a variety of colors so maybe we will give it another go.I did receive this item for free in exchange for my unbiased review however that did not influence my opinion in any way."
"JUNING",5,"This is a good wireless type of phone, the price is really cheap but the quality is good.This phone is already had the latest android system 5.1 lollipop.I don't need lots of specs on a phone, I'm not that tech on the phone.But in my end, I do like most phone work longer, easy to use, work as a friendly user.Anyway, one of the reasons why I have this phone, it's an unlocked phone, this phone can activate on a prepaid wireless network of your choice you can use either the regular sim card or the micro sim. The additional advantage is that you can use the phone in any country if you are into travel, this can be a helpful way to avoid roaming charges.Please watch my video.I received this product with a discount in exchanged for an honest and unbiased review.The reseller is not responsible for my opinion.

"JUNING",5," 5.0"" Phones Unlocked Android 5.1 MTK6580 Quad Core ROM 4GB 5.0MP Camera Dual Sim Quadband-JUNING GSM/3GCellphone Gold I am official a fan of Juning Phone. Not because i got in a special prize but this phone is really awesome! you wont regret having this phone. It functions like a a branded phone and really gives you a good use. the features of the phone are same like the branded phone we have. what i like most about this phone is there camera. the camera is really special and very clear once you capture a picture. another thing special about it, if you're a selfie addict like me you will definitely loved there camera. they have this feature in the camera that when you smile, the camera will automatically capture the image without touching the button! it is really cool! i was consume with it for an hour taking pictures of myself! when i first got the phone i only charged it for 2-3 hours and after that i used it, the battery last long. which is really good. Plus inside the box, it includes charger, headsets, a phone protector and screen protector. which is really cool! the screen is very wide. i enjoyed watching some movies and videos there. one thing i wanted to improve there is the phone storage. i hope it is more. but one thing another good about is you can extend the memory of your phone by putting a memory card on it. I really love this phone so much! i recommend this phone to all because it is really cool! it can be considered the best and be included in the branded phone that we have. you will not regret buying this phone because it is really awesome. i receive this product for free in exchange for my honest review."

I highly recommend this phone. The price is amazing, and its free shipping. My only con would be, it is a prime item, and it took 8 days to get to me...from the Midwest. I also don't really like the unverified purchase reviews given from obvious plants. I imagine they are ""given the phones in exchange for a review"", but are not actual purchases. I think this cheapens the integrity of the seller. This phone is high enough quality that it will speak for itself. The phone earned two, 5 star reviews from us, but the cheesiness of the planted reviews actually gives it a 2-3 star review. I would buy this phone again if something happened to the one I have.

"JUNING",1,"Cheap-- I am sending it back.."
"JUNING",5,"I bought this to replace my samsung galaxy s3 and this phone has went above an beyond my expectations. It works the same if not better than my Samsung did for more than half the price. I would def purchase again"
"JUNING",5,"My niece is 15 and so hard on phones, my sister has spent a ton of money replacing phones because at 15 years old the right phone matters. I was given the opportunity to try out the Juning 5"" Android phone and passed it along to my niece because I knew it would be perfect for her.Starting with the obvious looks. Just by looks alone, it's amazing. It's Pink and that is something so different than the average phone you can get with a major carrier. It easily resembles a Samsung in size and button placement so she doesn't look ""uncool"" and the screen is BIG which is important as we all know.The phone easily connected to my homes wifi for set up and I was more than impressed with the speed of it. The quad core is very compatible to my iPhone 6s Plus but without the $750 price tag. It is up to date on android and had many features that my niece was looking for including a front facing camera for those snapchat selfies. There is plenty of space to download other apps from the Google play store once you get yourself set up too.It is a dual sim phone but my niece doesn't travel out of the country though if that's of importance to you having that extra SIM card port is amazing.**3G (WCDMA 850/2100) 2G Quad Band (GSM 850/900/1800/1900) **That is the specifics as far as what the phone is compatible with. We have T-Mobile and it worked with no issues or lag straight away when we popped her SIM card in. Keep in mind this is at 3G and 2G speeds, it is in no way compatible with 4G or 4G LTE services but as we all know, most companies throttle our data to 2G after just a few gb and I hardly notice at all. I honestly noticed no lag at all in this phone at 3G or 2G speeds.The phones comes with a charger, earbuds, screen protector and a silicone case. I tried a Samsung lightening charger I had around the house but it didn't fast charge the phone. The ear buds are pretty meh.. Nothing amazing and the silicone case is better than nothing. My niece likes it because it is clear and shows off that she has a very unique pink phone. It seems like it provides better protection than none but I'm not sure where to find others since this is kind of a newer brand of phone.Overall, I'd say this is a great phone. It performs great and. For the price, you really can't beat all the kick you get in this Android phone. I'm an iPhone lover but my son is wanting one of these Junings for himself now too and they come in a variety of colors so maybe we will give it another go.I did receive this item for free in exchange for my unbiased review however that did not influence my opinion in any way."
"JUNING",5,"This is a good wireless type of phone, the price is really cheap but the quality is good.This phone is already had the latest android system 5.1 lollipop.I don't need lots of specs on a phone, I'm not that tech on the phone.But in my end, I do like most phone work longer, easy to use, work as a friendly user.Anyway, one of the reasons why I have this phone, it's an unlocked phone, this phone can activate on a prepaid wireless network of your choice you can use either the regular sim card or the micro sim. The additional advantage is that you can use the phone in any country if you are into travel, this can be a helpful way to avoid roaming charges.Please watch my video.I received this product with a discount in exchanged for an honest and unbiased review.The reseller is not responsible for my opinion.

Not because i got in a special prize but this phone is really awesome! you wont regret having this phone. It functions like a a branded phone and really gives you a good use. the features of the phone are same like the branded phone we have. what i like most about this phone is there camera. the camera is really special and very clear once you capture a picture. another thing special about it, if you're a selfie addict like me you will definitely loved there camera. they have this feature in the camera that when you smile, the camera will automatically capture the image without touching the button! it is really cool! i was consume with it for an hour taking pictures of myself! when i first got the phone i only charged it for 2-3 hours and after that i used it, the battery last long. which is really good. Plus inside the box, it includes charger, headsets, a phone protector and screen protector. which is really cool! the screen is very wide. i enjoyed watching some movies and videos there. one thing i wanted to improve there is the phone storage. i hope it is more. but one thing another good about is you can extend the memory of your phone by putting a memory card on it. I really love this phone so much! i recommend this phone to all because it is really cool! it can be considered the best and be included in the branded phone that we have. you will not regret buying this phone because it is really awesome. i receive this product for free in exchange for my honest review."
"JUNING",1,"Just received phone... Phone will not power on or take a charge?"
"JUNING",2,"Battery keeps running down not charging pass 60%"
"JUNING",2,"It was slow, but worked fine. However after only 2 weeks it wouldn't charge. After diagonosis, it was charging port that was defective and could not be repaired. May be just this one i received. I ended up returning the phone."
"JUNING",1,"It was advertised as being unlocked and compatible with AT&T- It didn't work with my sim card and when I took it into the AT&T store they tried there and weren't able to get it to work either, so I had to return it. Frustrating experience."
"JUNING",1,"Worst phone I have ever bought haven't had it more then a month or two and it freezes, resets to factory on its own, glitches to black screens, and tries to load pages I haven't even asked it to load, it charges so slow and the battery life sucks horribly, it launches a Justin beiber song randomly that hangs up your phone calls, and won't stay locked, snaps countless pictures and videos randomly in your pocket even while having a password lock on it, I absolutely hate this phone and regret buying two of them, the one I bought my girlfriend didn't work from the moment I bought it, DO NOT BUY THIS PHONE!!!"
"JUNING",3,"volume not loud"
"JUNING",1,"I don't know about other phone carriers but this phone does not work with T-Mobile. Calls out and calls coming in work maybe 1/10 times. The signal is terrible. Sad I can't use it when it's such a pretty phone. Will be returning this phone."
"JUNING",1,"Didn't work when it arrived! So I returned it! What a waste"
"JUNING",3,"OK so far"
"JUNING",5,"This is an amazing phone. I purchased the 6in for myself, and came back a week later, and bought the 5in for a friend. We are both really impressed with this phone. It is super easy to us,e and really sharp looking. I am not interested in paying hundreds, if not a thousand dollars for ANY PHONE! This has all of the functions anyone could ever need. I highly recommend this phone. The price is amazing, and its free shipping. My only con would be, it is a prime item, and it took 8 days to get to me...from the Midwest. I also don't really like the unverified purchase reviews given from obvious plants. I imagine they are ""given the phones in exchange for a review"", but are not actual purchases. I think this cheapens the integrity of the seller. This phone is high enough quality that it will speak for itself. The phone earned two, 5 star reviews from us, but the cheesiness of the planted reviews actually gives it a 2-3 star review. I would buy this phone again if something happened to the one I have. Thank you Amazon for providing such good products."
"e passion",2,"It was okay but the screen cracked after having it for 1 day"
"JUNING",5," I am so glad technology has evolved so much. From walkie talkie to a smartphone. It's such a huge leap, right? And I'm thankful to all the genius behind the creation of this technology because it has definitely made my life easier. I can still live without a smartphone but life won't ever be the same again.And talking about smartphones, I got the Juning T5 smartphone. It is an unlocked android 5.1 lollipop phone with a 5.5 inch screen size. It has all the features of a regular smartphone camera/video, sound recorder, calendar, clock, music, email, fm radio, flashlight, etc. And for full specifications, here's the linkhttps://www.amazon.com/gp/aw/d/B01GYUDMFY/ref=ya_aw_od_pi?ie=UTF8&psc=1This is a very cool phone because of the screen resolution which is very clear. The touch screen response time is very fast too. The camera, video and sound work very well. And since this is already unlocked, you can just choose whatever carrier you want and buy a sim from them and use it on this phone and it will work without issues. Just make sure to buy the GSM/WCDMA SIM card.One of my favorite features of this phone is the smartwake feature. You just have to tap the screen and it will turn the screen on. I also like the fact that the screen size is big enough to see pictures and videos clearly or read texts without difficulty.There are many emerging new smartphones in the market nowadays but Juning smartphones are highly competitive in terms of size, features and especially price.So if you are looking for a trustworthy brand, look at Juning smartphones' direction sold by Qianhai Changying. They have plenty of models to choose from. And this particular model, the Juning T5 has a very good value for the money. It's yours for only $77.99.I got this product for free in exchanged for my honest review."

"JUNING",5,"So far my son thinks it's a great phone"
"JUNING",5," I love the sleek feel and classy design. I have the white color and it is just beautiful. I will definitely have to keep a cover on this though. It is very sensitive to fingerprints. Not a big deal to me, as I generally interchange several covers regularly anyway.What I also like the most of this phone is, it's is dual sim, it means I can use two SIM cards at the same time. Also, the screen is very well responsive and the picture/video quality is excellent! It has a big viewing screen...resolution is great, it's thin, relatively lightweight, very well made, quality construction. Camera is excellent, it's very easy to use. Battery life is good, charges quickly. Overall, it's very nice product for the price and very well made. I would highly recommend this product.Package includes:1x Cellphone1x Battery1x USB Cable1x Charger1x EarphoneI receive this product at discounted price in exchange for my honest review and they are 100% my own opinions.

"JUNING",5,"Eye candy, this phone is hand candy. Must see in person to appreciate the beauty of this phone. I love all the phone functioning, the volume button. I love the phone case.

"JUNING",5,"I am very satisfied with this phone because of the amazing features it offers. With the price of $77.99, you can never go wrong with this phone. It has cool features that's similar to those popular and expensive brand of phones. It's great not having to spend a lot to be satisfied by such product and this Juning 5.5 Android unlocked phone has exceeded my expectation. Pretty impressive!It's almost the same size as the iPhone 6 Plus and it's very slim, so it is not bulky if you want to put this in your pocket. Indeed a pocket-friendly phone. The phone itself is user friendly, which means it is very easy to use and does not contain features that is hard and complicated to use or operate. Simply amazing! It is an unlocked dual sim smart phone, so it is really perfect for us to use any GSM simcard that we want and we can use this phone as back up phone as well whenever we want to travel to another country.One of my favorite features of this phone is the voice search which is very similar to Siri app in iPhones. Very convenient feature! You don't have to type what you want to search just in case you feel lazy and tired. You just press the voice search, say what you want to search and voila! it will automatically give you the results of what you've been searching for.This phone has satisfied me in many ways. For a budget friendly phone like this, there's no regret. I am indeed very happy. Highly recommended!I received this phone for free in exchange for my honest review and opinion. This review is entirely unbiased and is not dependent that I got this item for free. I hope you find my review helpful."
"JUNING",5," I am so impressed with this T5 model unlocked phone from JUNING. Impressive, why? Getting an android phone for $77.99 is awesome, with all the great features that other expensive phone have and it works great with our wifi connections and also works great while using my GSM sim card. Works smoothly and fast because of the processor unit that is quad core which is the fastest CPU that can be found on expensive smartphones and has an android 5.1 that provides a performance and stability updates, multiple SIM card support, HD voice calling and ""Device Protection,"" which secures lost or stolen devices against factory resets. It has a dual unlocked sim, which is great for a person like me, I have a small business and my business phone number is always separated to my personal number, mostly I will not talk to customers on weekends so that I can spare time with my family. Another thing is, because it’s unlocked, it can be use or compatible to all gsm networks and works great while traveling to different places.Talking about the camera, I am surprisingly amazed even though it’s only has 2.0 MP both front and back but it’s really clear, it seems that it has a 5.0 MP same as my camera before with 5.0 MP. Watching a video and listening to music to it, are totally responsive without any hang ups experience, the audio is totally clear and loud. Last but not the least that I love the most, is the wide touch screen that I didn’t have before, the screen is wide and crisp with a decent resolution and most of all it is slim, thin and lightweight and a slick product, so fast to response with only a soft touch. It is really impressive and very affordable to everyone. I’ve been using this as my regular phone for a couple of days now and I really love the way it works and the appearance on this phone is very classy and so handy. As you can see on the images below the back cover has rough surface with a good grip to prevent you from dropping it. The package includes: T5 model phone, Battery, USB Cable, Power adapter and earphone. This phone has 4 color options to choose from, Black, gold, pink and white. Indeed, Impressive worth to keep and handle with care. Highly recommended to everyone who's searching a affordable phone that works great. Thank you JUNING for this awesome product. I got this for free/discounted price through a promotional period and this is one of those deals where I am so blessed to get and test the efficiency and assess it for their future buyers. This will make it easier for others to find this review so they may be helped as well. I don’t get anything from it, but I get a good feeling that I helped someone. I am in no way required by the seller to leave positive remarks about their product. Thank you for taking the time to read my review."

"JUNING",4," This phone is pretty neat. For the price, it’s impressive – especially because it is unlocked and can be used with any carrier that has a large SIM card. This phone does not support 4G LTE internet, but does support 3G. This only means that the internet is a tad slower than some other phones that support 4G. It operates much like other android/google phones that I have come into contact with. It features a quad core processor, 1GB RAM, a 2.0 megapixel front camera and 5.0 megapixel back camera. It also includes dual flash, one on the front and one on the back which is pretty impressive. Wifi is enabled and it can be run off the wifi at home if there is no SIM card currently available. The back of the phone is very flexible but thin so be careful taking the back off – there is a small piece of tape over the battery connector to make sure the battery is charged before use. There are currently no cases available for the phone so be careful when handling it, overall, I’m very happy with the phone. It does everything that I need it to do and is an affordable alternative to shopping at the store (where its more expensive). It supports many apps, its a mobile hotspot, Youtube, Facebook, emails, messaging, Bluetooth, music, and more!Pros:• Affordability• Functionality (Wifi + Data)• Can be used on most carriers• Huge screen• Front and back flash• Quad core processor• Comes with a screen protector and clear case• Large font optionsCons:• Lack of cases and accessories for the phone• Camera quality could be improved• Support for 4G would be nice• Very slight sound distortion when using speakers all the way up for musicI would definitely repurchase this, it is perfect for my mother who uses her phone at work and to message on Facebook.I received this item for free in exchange for an honest, unbiased, and authentic review. I have thoroughly tested any product I review - I take pride in informing potential customers about the perks and flaws of products. I have no affiliation with the seller and am not obligated to leave a positive review."
"JUNING",5," 5.5"" Phone Unlocked Dual Sim Quad Core-JUNING Android 5.1 Cellphone Blue arrived in good condition and good packaging.I am so excited to finally receive this cell phone, it will be a gift for my nephew back home. Once I received it, I immediately began to charge it and was able to start the phone successfully. The operating system works perfectly and all the necessary updates make for fast and smooth operation. The camera is very powerful and produces excellent pictures. The built in microphone is very good and records audio very clearly. The video record and playback function is seamless and smooth. I also like the size of the phone and it has a good solid feel and weight. This cell phone came with a screen protector already installed and additional screen protectors in the package. This cell phone is very easy to use. I especially like having a dual sim option so that I can have a my work phone number be separate from personal number. This phone is very affordable and looks great!I love this cell phone and would absolutely recommend it to anyone.I received this cell phone at a reduced or discounted price in exchange for my honest and unbiased review."
"JUNING",5," Phone looks very nice, with a note equivilent hd screen. The OS is android 5.1, I am unsure if android 6.x is supported. Device has a light duty, slightly flimsy case, you will need to be careful taking it on and off as you could crack it while doing so. It also comes with a screen protector pre-applied so all you have to do is take the plastic bit off of the front and the screen protector is good to go. All of the software on the phone works fine, it has wifi, bluetooth, and sim signal. It has spots for 2 sim cards and 1 sd card, which will be great as an international phone if you plan on going out of the country. cameras both work fine, not super high MP but nothing to be worried about if a phone is your main camera. The phone is fast and I haven't had any trouble running basic apps over wifi like web browsers of facebook app. Basic games seem to work fine as well and run without a hitch. No downside that I can see outside of not being 4g/lte capable. Great phone for the price. Would love to get another one from same seller for my mother.I have received the item at a discounted price in exchange of my honest and unbiased review."
"JUNING",5,"I purchased this phone as a gift and we were very pleased with the packaging and the purchase. It was so easy to set up with a prepaid SIM card and ready to go. The battery lasts almost the entire day, it's beautiful and clear, and even came with a case, screen protector and headphibes. You can't beat that for a brand new Android, for the price. A lot of people confuse it for a high end phone at first glance. Not bad at all."
"JUNING",1,"worked well for a little while, however phone is unable to send or receive picture messages from the very beginning. what's weirder though is that the phone recieves adds at random, the camera app has adds, sometimes just random adds on the home screen and now that the phone is a week outside the return window it no longer charges at all. an absolute piece of garbage, don't waste your money"
"JUNING",1,"I wrote more positive review for this phone but after having it bit longer. And have buy a second for my daughter both will be getting returned on Monday. The battery randomly drain even if on charger. And no apps running also can't buy replacement battery. Am a regular customer of Amazon generally have very little complaint on products when I but. DON'T waste your money."
"JUNING",1,"Not happy with this phone. Not able to get but 1 gh on this phone. I have been with T-Mobile for 5 years and been very satisfied with their service. Because this phone is foreign, neither TMobile or ATT were able to get a faster internet. It is very slow and very often says it cant open the page and says retry. Also, the screen of the phone began cracking within a week of having it. This phone is only good for making phone calls and texting."
"JUNING",1,"Junk"
"JUNING",2,"Positive: Large screen is good for senior people. Cheap. Maybe ok for those people who don't use phone quite oftenNegative: doesn't cover WCDMA band in US. Only supports GSM network in US though it says WCDMA. Runs quite slow so that I have to slow down entering characters..."
"JUNING",2,"I ordered two of these based on the reviews..however I am very disappointed as they don't work as advertised, especially the camera and video functionality. I do not recommend and will be returning them."
"JUNING",5," This phone is a very pretty looking phone. It offers a slim profile however still great battery length. The quality is great. I was really satisfied with both the video and sound the phone offers. I have to say the color of the phone is one of my favorite features. It's not a tacky gold color. It don't appear cheap. It's actually more of a flat yet metallic look. The phone is very comfortable to hold and definitely isn't heavy. The battery, sim card slot, and SD slot are very easy to access and use. For me, this is very beneficial as I have to swap batteries often since I have to be on mobile web many hours a day. I often have to store photos and files on the SD cards for work. I also flip my sim cards between phones for work as well. This phone made things more convenient for me. The next favorite feature is the hot spot and tethering. I tether often with work and home life. I live in a town where the internet is very slow, and when I turn my tethering on, I can accomplish all my tasks faster than if I had just used my home wifi. The phone comes preloaded with both apps and quick load tabs. If your a busy person on the run like I am, these features are lifesavers. I often have to swap back and forth between four apps, and use many internet pages all day long. The fast tabs stop you from typing in URLs incorrectly. This phone helps me in both my personal and work life. The phone holds signal better than the prepaid phone I use. The battery life seems to last longer as well. I really enjoy this phone.

"JUNING",5,"Let me begin by saying that this is a wonderful cellphone. I was just impressed with all the quality, features and capabilities that it has. It's very comparable to leading Smartphones and IOS in the market today but at a reasonable price. When i opened the box, it contained all the accessories i need for the cellphone, you name it USB charger, manual, battery pack, headphones and also has extra case and screen protector that normally won't be included when you buy other cellphones. I love that it has dual camera, 2MP on the front and 5MP on back. This smartphone has all the features you would want like camera, messaging, bluetooth capability, WIFI, clock, calculator, wallpapers, calendar, email, GPS, FM, 3G and most of all can download tons of apps in the Play Store. I got the white color and just loves it, very light and thin, it downloads apps quickly, has very responsive touchscreen as well. I received this Smartphone at discount for an honest and unbiased review. All my reviews are completely my own and are based on my overall personal experience using the product. I leave reviews to help other customers make good buying decisions. I definitely would recommend this cellphone. What an excellent buy for what you get all in the package, plus it's unlocked so you can use it with any GSM providers. Not to mention it also has dual sim card slot and with great coverage. I'm very pleased with my new cellphone. It's definitely an Awesome buy!!!"

"JUNING",1,"Didnt offer clear and concise instructions on how to put in a sim card. I got bad eyesight so i put in a microsim in the sim slot. Tried to remove it with tweezers now the phone wont power on"
"JUNING",4,"This phone is very good for daily use like calling, texting, social media or net surfing. It's fast and the big 5.5"" inch screen is making things on the screen bigger and easy to read. I've been using this mainly for watching Youtube. My son loves using this as the screen is way bigger as compared to my iPhone 5C.This also came with a screen protector and a clear case that's a little gray in color. It is a dual sim card phone and you can also put an SD card inside the phone if you want to expand the memory.The only downside of this phone is the lack of internal space memory. I can't freely download anything I want into this phone because there's not enough space and right now I don't have a spare SD card to use for this phone. I really wish that for a nice phone like this, they should just make this an 8GB memory space rather than 4GB.Over all, this phone works as expected. For the price it's fair and a good size Android phone to have especially if you like YouTube or watch videos online."
"JUNING",1,"This is a updated review I'm so disappointed I gave this phone to friend in Jamaica I bought it in July and send it to Jamaica in august and the phone isn't working now.. the screen freeze up and no matter what is done it won't come back on.. it's not even 6 months.. how can I contact the vender??"
"JUNING",3,"The screen gets stuck, and goes black sometimes. It is also slow!"
"JUNING",5," I must say, I'm so impressed with this unlocked cell phone by Juning ! I've never had an unlocked cell phone before and I really needed a new phone. My old one was several years old and not working very well.I was very happy when I opened this phone and saw how big and clear the display is. This unlocked cell phone by Juning comes with the cell phone, battery, phone case, charger, USB cable and an earphone. It also has a thin screen protector on it.The phone itself is slim, lightweight and built well. It is 5.5 "" and has both front and back cameras. It is 3G which is fine as we mostly use wifi anyway. The camera is one of my favorite things about this phone. It takes awesome, clear, bright pictures!This cell phone stays charged for a long time even with lots of use. I love that it doesn't have a ton of pre-installed, useless apps on it that you can't uninstall. It also charges from the top instead of the bottom like most phones do which is great of you like to use your phone while it charges.This is a great phone for the price and I would definitely recommend it to my family and friends.I received this unlocked cell phone by Juning for free in exchange for my honest and unbiased opinion. This in no way affects how I feel about the product or my review of it."
"JUNING",5," I am sooo glad that I finally have a new phone! I always have a problem of my old phone because the screen stops working and i had my old phone I think more than 2 years now so ofcourse it already expected that I need a new one. And finally, when I got this Juning 5.5"" unlocked cell phones I never hesitate of purchasing this and would love to try this since this is my first time to have a unlocked phone. And when it arrived I was really impressed of how this phone looks so nice. The screen is so big and it is very slim and lightweight. It already has a screen protector and a phone casing. So I am not worried about how to find a phone casing because it is already included plus with a portable headset and a charger. So this is already has complete set. So I used my Verizon phone carrier and see if it does really works and I was totally impressed that it works. I got 3g of my phone which I can use it for wifi only. So far I like it. It works okay. As you can see in my video that I was provided you can see how does it works.And to my over all rating for this one so far this is nice for a reasonable price.I am so glad that I was given an opportunity to review this product for free in exchanged of my honest opinions."
"JUNING",5," When I got this phone I was so excited. Its very easy to use smartphone at a good ,affordable price. Perform as describe so compared to more expensive BRAND name phones that do the same thing .This phone is the best for the price you cant beat it.This phone is good for travelers because work with all GSM sim card around the world. I travel to my home country quit often and to have an extra phone where I can just drop a sim card is a must. This phone has a nice 5.5 inch screen which is I love and its pretty slim and lightweight. It has a pretty bright high resolution screen and the touch screen is very responsive. Honestly I think this JUNNING X6 has better feature than my S5 the screen are bigger the camera is great its clear like me I love selfie it has a beauty built in, which you can edit your picture right away put makeup on ,blush, eye shadow, eye liner eye lash, lip color ,face foundation .For selfie lover like me this is the phone. Some of the apps like Facebook,playstore,weChat and WhatsApp are already downloaded on the phone.Its really cool and advance smartphone you could ever find it work same thing as the galaxy phone but 1/4 of a price.DISCLEAMER:I receive this product at discounted price or for free in exchange for my honest and unbiased review. My review is base on my honest opinion and has nothing to do with the price I paid for the product."
"JUNING",5,"First thing you need to do on this phone is that set up a Google account to run your play store. It already have pre-installed Facebook, whatsapp, and gmail but you can install also other app that you love. The storage can hold up to 8GB enough space for you to save pictures, videos and games etc.Unfortunately this cellphone is only 3G but you can still use internet, on your phone by your SIM card or wifi works as good as 4G phones. I use sprint SIM card because it is the only phone company works at my area since l live out of town. But you can also use this phone with any other prepaid sim card.All in all this is a decent phone and it works good, affordable and user friendly. Though you can't compare this phone to a high end phone because you can still spot a difference. For the price this is a decent phone. I will recommend this phone.Disclaimer:This phone is provided for free to test and to review. My review is mine alone and it all honest and unbiased. It doesn't affect my review by receiving the product for free. Me myself I also rely on reviews before purchasing products, and I believe honest review is vital to other and to myself as well. I hope this helps. Thank you."
"JUNING",5," The JUNING phone I got was a 5.5"" Dual Sim Phone Unlocked 3G/GSM Android 5.1 Quad Core. Color : GOLDThe functionality of the phone is very similar to any Android phones but this one is very affordable and unlocked.The phone comes with:*Charger (USB-port)*Earphones*User's Manual*Clear phone case*A piece of paper with the note in order to use the battery.(remove the yellow film)*Attached to the screen already,the screen protection/scratch protection (a thin sheet)Like any other phones you got to test the functionality of it and I find it very easy to navigate. It has the default apps that we commonly use, like Facebook, Wechat, Whatsapp, ect. I added Facebook Messenger, Youtube, Google chrome web browser and even added NETFLIX.Camera, which we mostly use to capture the moments and share it to our family and friends. I have no complain, it captures very clearly.Battery wise, I fully charged it the first time and I watched one full movie for like 2 hours and it has still a little half of the battery. I was able to explore some of the features, check emails and do some social networking.But you got to read the label or the note that comes with it because there is a little film that you need to remove in order for you to use the battery.Size and weight: I think it is the perfect size of the screen for me and not heavy at all to carry around. The GOLD color is a plus, it looks so sophisticated and sleek.If you wanna do some screenshots, just press the button volume down and power button together. Because it is 3G you do not expect it to be as fast and quick as 4G.I connected it to my Wi-Fi and and connects pretty well.Over all impression: For this price of an Unlocked android phone is pretty good. If you go overseas and you need a phone that is unlocked and you can just plug in a prepaid sim card, this is a perfect solution and highly recommend this. You don't have to carry your phone that will charge you enormously when you use it overseas.I tried my T-Mobile sim and it works well.Got this phone in a discounted price for an honest review based on my experience while using it. And to help others who are looking for affordable and unlocked phones that works like any android phones that are expensive."

"JUNING",5,"I purchased this phone as a gift and we were very pleased with the packaging and the purchase. It was so easy to set up with a prepaid SIM card and ready to go. The battery lasts almost the entire day, it's beautiful and clear, and even came with a case, screen protector and headphibes. You can't beat that for a brand new Android, for the price. A lot of people confuse it for a high end phone at first glance. Not bad at all."
"JUNING",1,"worked well for a little while, however phone is unable to send or receive picture messages from the very beginning. what's weirder though is that the phone recieves adds at random, the camera app has adds, sometimes just random adds on the home screen and now that the phone is a week outside the return window it no longer charges at all. an absolute piece of garbage, don't waste your money"
"JUNING",1,"I wrote more positive review for this phone but after having it bit longer. And have buy a second for my daughter both will be getting returned on Monday. The battery randomly drain even if on charger. And no apps running also can't buy replacement battery. Am a regular customer of Amazon generally have very little complaint on products when I but. DON'T waste your money."
"JUNING",1,"Not happy with this phone. Not able to get but 1 gh on this phone. I have been with T-Mobile for 5 years and been very satisfied with their service. Because this phone is foreign, neither TMobile or ATT were able to get a faster internet. It is very slow and very often says it cant open the page and says retry. Also, the screen of the phone began cracking within a week of having it. This phone is only good for making phone calls and texting."
"JUNING",1,"Junk"
"JUNING",2,"Positive: Large screen is good for senior people. Cheap. Maybe ok for those people who don't use phone quite oftenNegative: doesn't cover WCDMA band in US. Only supports GSM network in US though it says WCDMA. Runs quite slow so that I have to slow down entering characters..."
"JUNING",2,"I ordered two of these based on the reviews..however I am very disappointed as they don't work as advertised, especially the camera and video functionality. I do not recommend and will be returning them."
"JUNING",5," This phone is a very pretty looking phone. It offers a slim profile however still great battery length. The quality is great. I was really satisfied with both the video and sound the phone offers. I have to say the color of the phone is one of my favorite features. It's not a tacky gold color. It don't appear cheap. It's actually more of a flat yet metallic look. The phone is very comfortable to hold and definitely isn't heavy. The battery, sim card slot, and SD slot are very easy to access and use. For me, this is very beneficial as I have to swap batteries often since I have to be on mobile web many hours a day. I often have to store photos and files on the SD cards for work. I also flip my sim cards between phones for work as well. This phone made things more convenient for me. The next favorite feature is the hot spot and tethering. I tether often with work and home life. I live in a town where the internet is very slow, and when I turn my tethering on, I can accomplish all my tasks faster than if I had just used my home wifi. The phone comes preloaded with both apps and quick load tabs. If your a busy person on the run like I am, these features are lifesavers. I often have to swap back and forth between four apps, and use many internet pages all day long. The fast tabs stop you from typing in URLs incorrectly. This phone helps me in both my personal and work life. The phone holds signal better than the prepaid phone I use. The battery life seems to last longer as well. I really enjoy this phone. I've enclosed a video to see the features of the phone. I would recommend this phone. I received this phone for free or at a reduced rate in exchange for my honest opinion."

"JUNING",4," This phone is pretty neat. For the price, it’s impressive – especially because it is unlocked and can be used with any carrier that has a large SIM card. This phone does not support 4G LTE internet, but does support 3G. This only means that the internet is a tad slower than some other phones that support 4G. It operates much like other android/google phones that I have come into contact with. It features a quad core processor, 1GB RAM, a 2.0 megapixel front camera and 5.0 megapixel back camera. It also includes dual flash, one on the front and one on the back which is pretty impressive. Wifi is enabled and it can be run off the wifi at home if there is no SIM card currently available. The back of the phone is very flexible but thin so be careful taking the back off – there is a small piece of tape over the battery connector to make sure the battery is charged before use. There are currently no cases available for the phone so be careful when handling it, overall, I’m very happy with the phone. It does everything that I need it to do and is an affordable alternative to shopping at the store (where its more expensive). It supports many apps, its a mobile hotspot, Youtube, Facebook, emails, messaging, Bluetooth, music, and more!Pros:• Affordability• Functionality (Wifi + Data)• Can be used on most carriers• Huge screen• Front and back flash• Quad core processor• Comes with a screen protector and clear case• Large font optionsCons:• Lack of cases and accessories for the phone• Camera quality could be improved• Support for 4G would be nice• Very slight sound distortion when using speakers all the way up for musicI would definitely repurchase this, it is perfect for my mother who uses her phone at work and to message on Facebook.I received this item for free in exchange for an honest, unbiased, and authentic review. I have thoroughly tested any product I review - I take pride in informing potential customers about the perks and flaws of products. I have no affiliation with the seller and am not obligated to leave a positive review."
"JUNING",5," 5.5"" Phone Unlocked Dual Sim Quad Core-JUNING Android 5.1 Cellphone Blue arrived in good condition and good packaging.I am so excited to finally receive this cell phone, it will be a gift for my nephew back home. Once I received it, I immediately began to charge it and was able to start the phone successfully. The operating system works perfectly and all the necessary updates make for fast and smooth operation. The camera is very powerful and produces excellent pictures. The built in microphone is very good and records audio very clearly. The video record and playback function is seamless and smooth. I also like the size of the phone and it has a good solid feel and weight. This cell phone came with a screen protector already installed and additional screen protectors in the package. This cell phone is very easy to use. I especially like having a dual sim option so that I can have a my work phone number be separate from personal number. This phone is very affordable and looks great!I love this cell phone and would absolutely recommend it to anyone.I received this cell phone at a reduced or discounted price in exchange for my honest and unbiased review."
"JUNING",5," Phone looks very nice, with a note equivilent hd screen. The OS is android 5.1, I am unsure if android 6.x is supported. Device has a light duty, slightly flimsy case, you will need to be careful taking it on and off as you could crack it while doing so. It also comes with a screen protector pre-applied so all you have to do is take the plastic bit off of the front and the screen protector is good to go. All of the software on the phone works fine, it has wifi, bluetooth, and sim signal. It has spots for 2 sim cards and 1 sd card, which will be great as an international phone if you plan on going out of the country. cameras both work fine, not super high MP but nothing to be worried about if a phone is your main camera. The phone is fast and I haven't had any trouble running basic apps over wifi like web browsers of facebook app. Basic games seem to work fine as well and run without a hitch. No downside that I can see outside of not being 4g/lte capable. Great phone for the price. Would love to get another one from same seller for my mother.I have received the item at a discounted price in exchange of my honest and unbiased review."

"JUNING",1,"I wish i could give it 0 or negative stars. Based on the high ratings from other customers, this was purchased for my mother. When she received it, the charging cable was too loose and the device would NOT accept a charge. She even tried 3 or 4 other charging cables, none of them worked on this device. In addition, when she tried to insert her SIM card (from old phone), the card fell into the slot and she had to fish it out with a needle. This task took a long time to finish. The other customers may have just gotten really lucky with their purchases--we did not. SAVE YOUR MONEY DO NOT BUY THIS JUNK."

"JUNING",5," Android Lollipop on a budget. This phone is great. It keeps the pre-installed apps at a minimum but gives you what you need at the same time.

"JUNING",5," So i got this Juning phone 3 days ago, and i started using it already, and i have no complains about this phone. Everything works well, i downloaded music as well and the built in speaker is super clear. As you can see it or hear on my video. You be the judge. Not just that, the apps works perfectly fine. And also before i forget, one thing that i ,ove about thins phone also is that it has BUILT in TORCH flashlight app already which we can use if or when there's a block out on a certain place that needs light.The quality of this JUNING phone is great i could not ask for more. Everything that i wrote and you've seen in the video is all true. Everything i say on my review is based on my personal experience for days that i have been using this juning phone. And lastly i will personally recommend this product to my family and friends. Its user friendly very easy to operate and Its really a great phone and its worth of your money as well too.I got this phone for free in return only of my honest and unbiased review of this product, I am writing what I experienced and only based of my experience, while using the JUNING PHONE. I would just like to thank sophie also, you are one of kind."

"JUNING",4,"I needed to replace my cellphone. My cellphone that I have had for 3 years wasn't a smart phone, just regular. I looked around and studied and found this was the best low priced unlocked smart phone. I can use it on WiFi to play games and browse. I use the cellphone strictly for calls and texts. I haven't tried it for texting, but I find it works wonderfully for calls. I had to re-learn how to make and receive calls, since this is the first time I have used a smart phone. I have an android tablet that I enjoy so I find this android smartphone to be handy to take with me if I want to browse on WiFi when I am away from home. I used to take the tablet and the cellphone with me when I went out. Now they are combined in one unit. This android cellphone/tablet is slow for a quad-core OS. I guess it is the .5 G of RAM that limits how fast it goes. I am satisfied with it however, and bring a lithium battery pack along to plug into the smartphone when the battery gets low and I want to play games or browse."

"JUNING",4," This phone is pretty neat. For the price, it’s impressive – especially because it is unlocked and can be used with any carrier that has a large SIM card. This phone does not support 4G LTE internet, but does support 3G. This only means that the internet is a tad slower than some other phones that support 4G. It operates much like other android/google phones that I have come into contact with. It features a quad core processor, 1GB RAM, a 2.0 megapixel front camera and 5.0 megapixel back camera. It also includes dual flash, one on the front and one on the back which is pretty impressive. Wifi is enabled and it can be run off the wifi at home if there is no SIM card currently available. The back of the phone is very flexible but thin so be careful taking the back off – there is a small piece of tape over the battery connector to make sure the battery is charged before use. There are currently no cases available for the phone so be careful when handling it, overall, I’m very happy with the phone. It does everything that I need it to do and is an affordable alternative to shopping at the store (where its more expensive). It supports many apps, its a mobile hotspot, Youtube, Facebook, emails, messaging, Bluetooth, music, and more!Pros:• Affordability• Functionality (Wifi + Data)• Can be used on most carriers• Huge screen• Front and back flash• Quad core processor• Comes with a screen protector and clear case• Large font optionsCons:• Lack of cases and accessories for the phone• Camera quality could be improved• Support for 4G would be nice• Very slight sound distortion when using speakers all the way up for musicI would definitely repurchase this, it is perfect for my mother who uses her phone at work and to message on Facebook.I received this item for free in exchange for an honest, unbiased, and authentic review. I have thoroughly tested any product I review - I take pride in informing potential customers about the perks and flaws of products. I have no affiliation with the seller and am not obligated to leave a positive review."
"JUNING",5," 5.5"" Phone Unlocked Dual Sim Quad Core-JUNING Android 5.1 Cellphone Blue arrived in good condition and good packaging.I am so excited to finally receive this cell phone, it will be a gift for my nephew back home. Once I received it, I immediately began to charge it and was able to start the phone successfully. The operating system works perfectly and all the necessary updates make for fast and smooth operation. The camera is very powerful and produces excellent pictures. The built in microphone is very good and records audio very clearly. The video record and playback function is seamless and smooth. I also like the size of the phone and it has a good solid feel and weight. This cell phone came with a screen protector already installed and additional screen protectors in the package. This cell phone is very easy to use. I especially like having a dual sim option so that I can have a my work phone number be separate from personal number. This phone is very affordable and looks great!I love this cell phone and would absolutely recommend it to anyone.I received this cell phone at a reduced or discounted price in exchange for my honest and unbiased review."
"JUNING",5," Phone looks very nice, with a note equivilent hd screen. The OS is android 5.1, I am unsure if android 6.x is supported. Device has a light duty, slightly flimsy case, you will need to be careful taking it on and off as you could crack it while doing so. It also comes with a screen protector pre-applied so all you have to do is take the plastic bit off of the front and the screen protector is good to go. All of the software on the phone works fine, it has wifi, bluetooth, and sim signal. It has spots for 2 sim cards and 1 sd card, which will be great as an international phone if you plan on going out of the country. cameras both work fine, not super high MP but nothing to be worried about if a phone is your main camera. The phone is fast and I haven't had any trouble running basic apps over wifi like web browsers of facebook app. Basic games seem to work fine as well and run without a hitch. No downside that I can see outside of not being 4g/lte capable. Great phone for the price. Would love to get another one from same seller for my mother.I have received the item at a discounted price in exchange of my honest and unbiased review."
"JUNING",5,"I purchased this phone as a gift and we were very pleased with the packaging and the purchase. It was so easy to set up with a prepaid SIM card and ready to go. The battery lasts almost the entire day, it's beautiful and clear, and even came with a case, screen protector and headphibes. You can't beat that for a brand new Android, for the price. A lot of people confuse it for a high end phone at first glance. Not bad at all."
"JUNING",1,"worked well for a little while, however phone is unable to send or receive picture messages from the very beginning. what's weirder though is that the phone recieves adds at random, the camera app has adds, sometimes just random adds on the home screen and now that the phone is a week outside the return window it no longer charges at all. an absolute piece of garbage, don't waste your money"
"JUNING",1,"I wrote more positive review for this phone but after having it bit longer. And have buy a second for my daughter both will be getting returned on Monday. The battery randomly drain even if on charger. And no apps running also can't buy replacement battery. Am a regular customer of Amazon generally have very little complaint on products when I but. DON'T waste your money."
"JUNING",1,"Not happy with this phone. Not able to get but 1 gh on this phone. I have been with T-Mobile for 5 years and been very satisfied with their service. Because this phone is foreign, neither TMobile or ATT were able to get a faster internet. It is very slow and very often says it cant open the page and says retry. Also, the screen of the phone began cracking within a week of having it. This phone is only good for making phone calls and texting."
"JUNING",1,"Junk"
"JUNING",2,"Positive: Large screen is good for senior people. Cheap. Maybe ok for those people who don't use phone quite oftenNegative: doesn't cover WCDMA band in US. Only supports GSM network in US though it says WCDMA. Runs quite slow so that I have to slow down entering characters..."
"JUNING",2,"I ordered two of these based on the reviews..however I am very disappointed as they don't work as advertised, especially the camera and video functionality. I do not recommend and will be returning them."
"JUNING",5," This phone is a very pretty looking phone. It offers a slim profile however still great battery length. The quality is great. I was really satisfied with both the video and sound the phone offers. I have to say the color of the phone is one of my favorite features. It's not a tacky gold color. It don't appear cheap. It's actually more of a flat yet metallic look. The phone is very comfortable to hold and definitely isn't heavy. The battery, sim card slot, and SD slot are very easy to access and use. For me, this is very beneficial as I have to swap batteries often since I have to be on mobile web many hours a day. I often have to store photos and files on the SD cards for work. I also flip my sim cards between phones for work as well. This phone made things more convenient for me. The next favorite feature is the hot spot and tethering. I tether often with work and home life. I live in a town where the internet is very slow, and when I turn my tethering on, I can accomplish all my tasks faster than if I had just used my home wifi. The phone comes preloaded with both apps and quick load tabs. If your a busy person on the run like I am, these features are lifesavers. I often have to swap back and forth between four apps, and use many internet pages all day long. The fast tabs stop you from typing in URLs incorrectly. This phone helps me in both my personal and work life. The phone holds signal better than the prepaid phone I use. The battery life seems to last longer as well. I really enjoy this phone. I've enclosed a video to see the features of the phone. I would recommend this phone. I received this phone for free or at a reduced rate in exchange for my honest opinion."
"JUNING",5,"Let me begin by saying that this is a wonderful cellphone. I was just impressed with all the quality, features and capabilities that it has. It's very comparable to leading Smartphones and IOS in the market today but at a reasonable price. When i opened the box, it contained all the accessories i need for the cellphone, you name it USB charger, manual, battery pack, headphones and also has extra case and screen protector that normally won't be included when you buy other cellphones. I love that it has dual camera, 2MP on the front and 5MP on back. This smartphone has all the features you would want like camera, messaging, bluetooth capability, WIFI, clock, calculator, wallpapers, calendar, email, GPS, FM, 3G and most of all can download tons of apps in the Play Store. I got the white color and just loves it, very light and thin, it downloads apps quickly, has very responsive touchscreen as well. I received this Smartphone at discount for an honest and unbiased review. All my reviews are completely my own and are based on my overall personal experience using the product. I leave reviews to help other customers make good buying decisions. I definitely would recommend this cellphone. What an excellent buy for what you get all in the package, plus it's unlocked so you can use it with any GSM providers. Not to mention it also has dual sim card slot and with great coverage. I'm very pleased with my new cellphone. It's definitely an Awesome buy!!!"
"JUNING",5,"When I received this phone, I was very Impressed and the color are very cool we never had a color blue phone.Before I give the review I used it and I did try how good it is .

"JUNING",5,"Let me begin by saying that this is a wonderful cellphone. I was just impressed with all the quality, features and capabilities that it has. It's very comparable to leading Smartphones and IOS in the market today but at a reasonable price. When i opened the box, it contained all the accessories i need for the cellphone, you name it USB charger, manual, battery pack, headphones and also has extra case and screen protector that normally won't be included when you buy other cellphones. I love that it has dual camera, 2MP on the front and 5MP on back. This smartphone has all the features you would want like camera, messaging, bluetooth capability, WIFI, clock, calculator, wallpapers, calendar, email, GPS, FM, 3G and most of all can download tons of apps in the Play Store. I got the white color and just loves it, very light and thin, it downloads apps quickly, has very responsive touchscreen as well. I received this Smartphone at discount for an honest and unbiased review. All my reviews are completely my own and are based on my overall personal experience using the product. I leave reviews to help other customers make good buying decisions. I definitely would recommend this cellphone. What an excellent buy for what you get all in the package, plus it's unlocked so you can use it with any GSM providers. Not to mention it also has dual sim card slot and with great coverage. I'm very pleased with my new cellphone. It's definitely an Awesome buy!!!"

"NOKIA",5,"I LOVE THIS PHONE. IT'S REALLY WORTH IT. AMAZON IS VERY EFFICIENT. KEEP UP THE GOOD WORKS PLEASE DON'T CHANGE."
"NOKIA",2,"Bought this phone as a factory-refurb. When it arrived, I plugged it in to charge and the splash screen came up... great I thought and walked away. Looked an hr later to check the progress and nothing had changed! No status bar, nothing! This should have been my first indication of trouble. Unplugged, plugged, unplugged, plugged and then the status bar came up...A cool feature is that the phone gives an audible alert when the battery is full! But then it was a witch to get it to turn on! Hold the button, wait for splash screen, wait to see if it initializes... if/when it doesn't, take the back off, take the battery out and start all over... usually 4-5 times before the phone would initialize! At first, I just figured this was a consequence of the battery being completely dead but nope... had to go through this EVERY time the phone was turned off!So I returned it (under the 30 day warranty) and the seller sent a new phone. Great! Well, I couldn't get the new phone past the splash screen no matter what I did!!!So, as far as features once I did get the first phone to work...The music player is really pretty nice! The built-in speakers sound great for a phone! The touch screen is responsive and the phone feels great in your hand! And, the wifi was pretty cool... BUT (and now the bad)... you can't see anything on the screen in direct sunlight! the headphone jack is proprietary. And, there aren't a lot of apps... I mean, even the facebook ""app"" was essentially a bookmark to the FB webpage. For this price point, I wasn't expecting an iPhone but seriously, this phone left a lot to be desired!So, my opinion is that this phone is a POS... 1/2 star for the phone working nicely when it worked, 1/2 star for the features, and 1 star for the music player sounding so great... Don't bother..."
"JUNING",5," I like this 6 "" wide screen and it's perfect for watching video and playing games. I usually leave my review after many weeks of using the phone so this post is late.Love the unlocked dual simcard.Pictures quality is decent and clear.cellphone features are great.High resolution.You can use this phone anywhere in the country and you can use this phone outside the country too because it's unlocked.This phone is affordable and it feels like similar to my samsung.The only down side of this phone is that I noticed if you don't use it much the battery won't stay full even you don't use it.But over all this is a great phone for the price and it won't hurt you to buy this and try.Disclamer:I got this phone for free in return to my unbiased review."
"JUNING",5,"I have to start out by saying that I really like this phone. I love the 6"" screen. Once you use a 6"" screen, it's really hard to go back smaller. I currently had a 6"" when I received this phone however mine was lacking one feature that I need to have available. That's the hotspot tethering feature. In my line of work, I often end up in places that have no wifi. Which tends to make things difficult for me since I have to be on a computer often. This tethering feature allows me to put my computer on the internet when wifi isn't available as long as I have at least one bar of signal. I have tested out and love this feature as much if not more than the screen size. It's really easy to turn on and off as well.The phone has all my needs that I have to use daily already preset in it. Not only that, but the phone is capable of taking screenshots. There are still many phones that don't offer that option. This feature i use at least 50 times a day.I often listen to music and love that YouTube is readily available. On the home screen if the phone, it comes with a built in radio app. The radio app isn't the greatest but how can you complain, after all you have a radio available everyday all day long. The phone also has the Google play store preinstalled which allows you to add other music apps such as Pandora.The Google play store allows you to download games, videos, and all sorts of apps. Many if them are free of charge.I travel a lot in the evening hours and find myself using flashlights often. However, you ever tried opening a door while holding your keys, phone, and flashlight? Ya, it's hard. This phone is preloaded with the torch app which is a flashlight.Pictures is another feature i have to use daily for work, but I also take lots of pictures in my personal life. This has both front and rear facing cameras. The rear has a flash. The phone comes preloaded with a cool app that has special features for editing photos. Including the smart shot and beauty app.Can't forget to mention the clock, calendar, and calculater apps. I often have to rely on my phone as an alarm clock on the road. I have to use a calendar daily to remember all my appointments. The calculator app is also high important as I am constantly dealing with money.This phone comes with dual sim card slots. I love the idea that it can be used anywhere in the world. It's also a unlocked phone so you can put it on almost any carrier. I use a prepaid carrier. Another bonus is that you can put a micro SD card in there to expand the memory.Overall, this phone is a great phone. It actually has suited all the needs I have on a daily basis. The picture and sound quality is good. You can pick up wifi range further than a lot of phones I've had in the past. It comes ready to be used. It's packed securely and the package is discreet. I would recommend this phone. I received this phone free or at a discounted price in exchange for my honest opinion."

"JUNING",5,"'JUNING SMARTPHONE C5Color: GoldSize: 6.0""I been wanting to have a new smartphone that has a bigger screen size compared to what I have right now, so I feel lucky to have this one. It comes with Manual, battery charger/USB, earphone, clear casing that fit so right and not bulky at all. Juning Unlocked Smartphone 6.0 C5 exceeded my expectations, the phone is well made and looks expensive, and so since I love to take selfie's I immediately tried the 'camera front and back, I am impressed! I had low expectations having 2.2 MP camera front and back, I thought the camera quality resolution will be bad and I'll say I am very wrong. The picture quality is decent clear, it takes a good selfies' and 'videos, I super love it, now I can take selfies anywhere I go. There's a plus for me using camera selfie of this phone, because I don't have to download picture editor or camera360 etc., it comes with it! already ready to use, just simple take your selfie, click makeup in the bottom right side of the screen then holla, there yah go, you can now beautify yourself without downloading any apps, that just saved memory storage.''''''What I like also is for 6"" smartphone it is very light to carry around, with that said I can now leave my iPad at home and just carry my Juning Smartphone C5 6"" with me, because of the size it is like having 2in1, phone and tablet at the same time which is cool. If you have small hand like me' you need to use to hands while using it. ^____^Juning Smartphone 6.0"" is unlocked phone so you can use GSM/WCDMA SIM card, it is not compatible for CDMA SIM card so be aware of that before you buy SIM card, it is good for roaming sim card number, I can now use sim card to text and call my family back home in PH.The phone is nice and clear, looks like HD. Phone storage is 4 GB, up to 16 GB, so I slot my memory card for more storage memory. I was thinking buying bigger memory card like 16GB so that I don't have to worry of getting low of memory specially storing my pictures and apps. 'The phone sound is clear, makes me enjoy listening music' '''. In regard of Battery Life, Probably won't last too long if you use it constantly with full brightness, as I experienced the phone was full since 7am in the morning,I go to work using phone, got home 5:30pm and still have battery life, that is without using it too much. It don't really bother me since I have one power bank with me all the time in case I need it. And if you want to stretch the battery life longer, you can always lower down the brightness of the display. I must say if you use too much phone, you may consider buying extra battery or power bank to be with you, Juning also have Power bank portable external battery charger with smart charger technology for affordable price, check that out.'I am using my phone often using Facebook, Instagram, listening music, watching videos and of course taking selfies/pictures, sometimes the app crashed which is natural for me, same to my old phone and even my iPad crashed too, so that's not a problem. Also, sometimes it seems phone freezing or slow down, but not a problem for me anymore, just search Mr. Google what to do, how to make android phone faster and boom problem solved. :) I don't play games right now because I don't have time for that at this moment so I can't rate that part using this phone. Connecting to wifi was fast and easy, downloading some apps with no problem.Overall for the price under $100 with 6"" screen, I can't complain! It's not the best phone out there compared to branded expensive smartphone that will cost you $$$$, and with that said without breaking your bank and still have nice 6"" smartphone.' Juning Unlocked smartphone 6.0"" C5 is perfectly right for me, I already felt like I am having a iPhone 6s.Also, Juning has a great customer service. Thank you Ms Sophie you're one of a kind.Purchased this phone for free except for the shipping and handling, this phone was like for testing in return of my honest review of this product, i am only writing what i experienced, noticed while using this phone.Pictures and video will be uploaded on my next update.'I will update once i noticed something different."

"JUNING",1,"Phone worked great for two weeks. Started having problems opening and closing Apps, constantly have to press button for apps"
"JUNING",1,"Phone sucks"
"JUNING",5,"Good Phone"
"JUNING",1,"worst phone ever, gets hot while playing games, hesitates and automatically switches to home screen while in other apps., returned pronto!!!"
"JUNING",1,"WAIST OF YOU MONEY DONT BUY IT DONT LET THE LOOKS FOOL YOU !!! IM GETTING MY MONEY BACK"
"JUNING",1,"Very slow and my provider said it is an old phone. I threw it in the trash"
"JUNING",4,"Good phone but where do I buy screen protectors"
"JUNING",3,"Over all the phone was very nice...My friends have Samsung and even they was impressed by this phone.However I took it to Metro and the phone would not recognize the system so I wasn't able to active it.."
"JUNING",1,"One of the worst phones I have ever had. Apps shut down constantly and phone turns off by itself. Apps always say they need to be force closed. YouTube is very very slow, and shuts down randomly. One of the worst buys I have ever had."
"JUNING",3,"The size of the phone is great! The bad part is that sometimes the phone freezes and the screen will revert back to the home screen without a button being pressed.Some of the apps do not work like YouTube. It would not download for me. It would be nice if the phone supported 4G LTE. I am undecided on whether I want to keep this phone or upgrade to a cheap 4G supported phone."
"Ulefone",3,"The phone works ok here and overseas but don't have the storage so you can't see email or text message until you delete things so that was a let down"
"Ulefone",1,"This phone is terrible. International model runs on 2g (T-Mobile) and the screen went dead a week after receiving it."
"Ulefone",1,"Within a day I returned this phone back to Amazon. Nice screen but that's all. Poor internet service. Only allowed 2G network. Downloads were slow. This phone is good if you only plan to use it for Talk and text. Anything else it's a waste of money."
"Ulefone",5,"Great phone,totally worth it"
"Ulefone",5,"I have nothing bad to say.....my phone made it right on time.This is a very huge phone just what I wanted.... And also came with not one but two battery #winning"
"Ulefone",1,"Hate this phone had it for one day"
"Ulefone",5,"Please you didn't do good at this time by sending me a different phone because the phone is not pad phone and moreover is not up to 6"" Inch as I saw before ordering it. No cover like the one I have from you before. I'm now afraid to order from you because you would not send what I request for. Have a good day"
"Ulefone",1,"was not what they say good luck getting it to work"
"Ulefone",5,"Excelente.!"
"Ulefone",4,"There are only a couple problems with the phone.. 1) I can't turn off this extremely loud defining beep that goes off ever 30sec-1min. I tired to get help from the company but they never responded to my emails. The people on the other end of the phone conversation say they can hear it too which leads them to sometimes think its a call coming in on there end. 2) the camera is extremely touchy. You have to have it very still or shots will be blurred.3) internal memory is very low, you can only download a few apps. It reads storage space running low all the time after clearing everything. Other than that its not a bad phone."
"Ulefone",5,"GR8 PHONE!!!! All the benefits of a Samsung w.o the inflated price!! I love the screen size! Its bigger than the note 2/3 guys so it makes the viewing better, but harder to find really cool cases. All in all well worth the lack in accesories for the phone."
"Ulefone",5,"I ended up selling it to my brother. It was HUGE! I knew with a 6 inch screen it would be, but it seemed very bulky. He loves it though!"
"Ulefone",3,"The battery goes down to quick, takes a while to recharge....but you do have another one. When taking a pic u cannot breathe or it is blurred. When purchased on line someone got my credit card and purchased an airline ticket overseas and some store purchases. If my bank had not known my purchase status because I am disabled whoever could have used all of my monthly bills. I actually wanted a samsung 4 or notebook but could not purchased financially, everyone be carefully. The microSDHC and SD that most ppl order does not go with this phone, so I got to look for the correct ones because the music I had on my other phones will not work, wish I could have just bought the Samsung 4 or notebook..."
"Ulefone",1,"My charger does not work.I would like one that works that's what I paid my money for.The phone works fine."
"Ulefone",1,"PHONE WASN'T WHAT I WAS LOOKING FOR, NICE LOOKING PHONE BUT LOOKS CAN BE DECEIVING, WOULDN'T BUY AGAIN, SENT IT BACK."
"Ulefone",3,"When making calls screen goes black and won't light back up when take away from face to hang up. Auto rotation does not work very well either. Phone isn't very fast and I know it's bot my internet connection I have experimented"
"Ulefone",3,"love the size of the phone dont realy know if its 2g or 3g an the network is realy slow an can't ope playstore or watch videos"
"Ulefone",1,"Do not buy!!! It's a sturdy phone but it capabilities for connectivity is horrible I bought this because I tried to save 50 but I the end I ended up buying a Blu phone anyway u will not get any data on this phone just spend the extra 50 and get a Blu phone its amazing"
"Ulefone",3,"Hey I received my phone today and im with straight talk service but it seem like my phone wasn't working and it hurted me do badly because I really like this phone I was do excited about it I didn't know if I need an another phone or was my sim cards was bad or what but im just really sad agout how it went down I fidnt quiet understand y it had two sim slotd or nothing but I was really confused about it all"
"Ulefone",5,"Works great have an ATT Straight talk sim chip and works Great!!!! Just when and if you buy a case make sure you can try it with the phone! bought an note 2 case and phone is to big for it"
"Ulefone",1,"It didn't work at all"
"Ulefone",1,"just received it today not coming on just blinking and its been charging over 2 hours"
"Ulefone",1,"Didn't fit our needs in the rural area where we live. We did send it back and were refunded our money in very promptly."
"Ulefone",1,"Totally horrible. The picture does NOT match the product. This picture shows a cute and up to date phone. The one I received was a generic, fake, and not a good one at that. If I'd had the option, I would have given zero stars."
"Ulefone",5,"Only rating it 5 stars so you can see this thing is junk! Don't waste your money the screen came all kind of messed up. Couldn't see anything on it!!!"
"Ulefone",2,"Doesnt work like its suppose to"
"Ulefone",1,"it was the worst item in history it didint work."
"Ulefone",1,"HMM"
"Ulefone",1,"The phone is very poor. I can't access internet it keeps blocking me. No wifi it keeps rejecting wifi. voice very low i can't here it when am driving. the ear phone are also very low keeps falling out the ears. Screen is very sensitive anything that touches it stops what you are listening to or changes your settings. you close the cover you won't hear anything it will stop. This phone is very poorly made and don't serve my of having a phone. It keeps rejecting my SD cards and it has lost all the information I had saved for the last 2 yrs. I can't get anywhere else. Plz I would to return the phone and get my money back. I rather pay more but get a phone that serves right. Don't buy it plz. Even my 20 yrs old children can't figure it out."
"Ulefone",1,"Love it until the phone stop charging and no its not the battery or charger. Its the phone. Had to buy a whole new phone. Try to take it to repair shop they could not help me. It is better to purchase a whole new phone."
"Ulefone",1,"Don't even think about buying it. Its a piece of failed technology, I wasted my money buying it. Its now in the trash."
"Ulefone",3,"It OK but I thuovit will work better then it do."
"Ulefone",1,"Based on other peoples ratings I bought one, then I found it wasn't as they were positively recommending at all, It took about 48 hours to download just one app. You may try one if you think otherwise"
"Ulefone",5,"The phone is like a tablet, I love it. Takes good picture and video. For now, I have not seen any problems or have any issues with it. My friends likes it."
"Ulefone",1,"Phone is nice size but for that price internet is to slow returned it and got blu studio 5.5s"
"Ulefone",1,"I bought two of these phones for my husband and myself back in February. It only took a couple of days for his to stop working properly. It went dead one day and after he put it on the Charger it still wouldn't turn back on....then mine broke about a month after my purchase, the busted on it with very minor impact , for example like putting it in my purse and just walking around. With it for a couple of hours.... I continued to use it with a busted screen BC I couldn't afford. Repairs and finally about six months. After my purchases it finally knocked. Off and died too....and what little time it did work it would constantly go dead took hours to charge would die within3 mins and never had a bit of working. Speed....it always ran slow ands would ffreeze up. Final thought, I wasted over 400$ on these. Phones and. I could have gotten better use out of a little toy phone then this phone! Worst phone I have ever seen before and very cheaply made!!!"
"Ulefone",1,"I was not happy with the internet was very slow with t mobil service, the ringer volume was too low and the color was very dim"
"Ulefone",1,"I got the phone and when I opened the box, there was the phone, charger, and cord, and only one battery. It was supposed to come with two batteries. I wrote the seller and they told me there was one in the phone, but there was not. I asked them to send me another battery like they ad promised, but they refused. instead they said they would refund me $3.00, but I have yet to see that either."
"Ulefone",5,"Best phone for your buck i have to say. Dose every thing i wanted and then some. the 6"" screen makes it alot easier to read and type."
"Ulefone",4,"just good, i love it .the screen is just great, graphic is good also..i love everything about it"
"Ulefone",4,"This phone is excillent!! first things first.the screen is beautiful, bright, and isnt really pixelated. it has great viewing angles compared to other android phones from a China manufacturer. but beware that if you are epecting to get 3G on T-Mobile's network it only supports EDGE wich is converted to 2.5G which is pretty slow in my opinion. idk about at&t but in a few months i might switch just to see if it supports AT&T' 3G"
"Ulefone",5,"I am in love with this phone and so is everyone else who sees this phone. I love the size of the screen and the speed of the WI- Fi. Great phone."
"Ulefone",5,"Great service& great cell phone,yes to having speaker phone,I'll let you know about anything else,fun to have,got to take up space to end it on this,bye"
"Ulefone",2,"I would have loved this phone but the charging port at the bottom was broke and had to send it back."
"Ulefone",5,"I bought 2 of these phones for my wife and I and both of us love them every where i go i see people who have Galaxy S3 and 4 asking me where did I get that phone they all want to throw away their for mine love it."
"Ulefone",5,"HEY EVERYBODY! After much gnashing of teeth I found a WONDERFUL power supply from EBAY with a LONG PRONG that is PEFECT!! It isItem: 171730876692 on ebay.com"
"Ulefone",4,"So far everything is pretty awesome, my plan does not work with it so I have to go to a way more expensive carrier. I won't know until then just how well this phone serves me. The price was absolutely fabulous and the screen size really is what I was going for without having to pay up with my first born!"
"Ulefone",5,"Great phone"
"Ulefone",1,"I was expecting a 6"" screen and it was 6"". Everything else not as expected with this good looking phone."
"Ulefone",2,"When I received this phone, which it took about a month. I got the phone I was excited for how big it is, but after waiting so long to get the phone I couldn't even use it without a sim card. Finally got the sim and found out that the internet doesn't work, which means the google play store doesn't work, which means I cant do anything with this phone but call and text. This sucks because im into apps and the internet. Am I the only one who had this problem?????"
"Ulefone",5,"This is an amazing Android phone. Very well-made. The price has been going up and down like a yoyo, though. Two weeks after I ordered it, there was a US$19 drop. The vendor has kindly promised to send an additional battery to make it up. Service from this vendor (lol-buy) is quite good. No complaints here.There is already a very helpful and somewhat long review thread on the orange version. I'll simply touch upon two major issues here:(1) The sim cards: I have tried an AT&T data plan micro-sim (an adapter is needed), booted up the phone and the card is recognized. After entering info in the sim management panel, 3G service is indicated by an H next to the signal bars. No problems answering and calling at all. Then a second sim from another country is tested, also recognized right away; although a field test will have to be deferred until my next overseas trip.(2) The GPS: It actually works well. A Satellite Check app (also included in the Polaris Navigation app) operating in the magnetic mode (for indoor use) picks up 9-12 satellites in a few minutes. It takes only seconds to get a fix outdoors. Google Navigation works flawlessly.On the flip side, the display is no retina display; it is just good enough for general viewing. And some apps don't work - those requiring a magnetic sensor (it does not have one), for example, the compass apps. Not deal breakers, of course.Overall, for the money, this is a surprisingly good smartphone. Some tweaking is needed, but it is part of the fun.5/13/2013 Update: (1) The vendor quickly sent over the battery. (2) After many tries, this phone simply cannot be rooted.6/4/2013 Update: This phone actually can be rooted. Now it is perfect!7/19/2013: After almost 3 months of daily use, this phone is still going strong. There has been a huge improvement, thanks to Google. The newest Google Maps no longer stays in RAM thus avoiding the previous version's eating up the memory.8/15/2013: After inserting a new battery, all of a sudden, the phone begins to randomly shut down, does not wake up from sleep, cannot fully reboot, and worse, the battery cannot be re-charged. Turns out to be a contact issue: the three copper pins on the battery and the phone sometimes do not kiss tightly. The battery needs to be about 0.1-0.2mm longer. A spacer made from aluminum foil corrects the problems. These symptoms are suspiciously similar to some previous comments complaining about a broken phone or unchargeable battery. Probably just a loose connection.3/3/2014: After testing umpteen apps. Two prove the most useful: (1) a browser with a funny name ""Naked Browser"" allows automatic deletion of history, cache, etc, on exit; and (2) MobileUncle is a must, in its Engineering -> localization mode, a GPS fix can be obtained in less than 18 sec. Others such as Documents-to-Go works well with Dropbox and phone calls, both US and international, with Viber is a breeze. This dual core phone still does a good job, it'll be interesting to see if the ones with octacore will now take over."
"Ulefone",4,"I have family mobile prepaid sim card and it worked right away the phone gets good signal and its works great.. The phone is not real fast but its fast enough and everything works fine.. For this price it is not bad at all."
"Ulefone",5,"WOW. WHERE DO I START, THERE ARE SO MANY GREAT THINGS ABOUT THIS PHONE, HUGE SCREEN FOR US HARD TO SEE FOLKS, THAT OUR EYES ARE AGING. WORKS WELL, WITH SIMS, FROM STAIGHT TALK, T_MOBILE, AT&T, SO IF YOU HAVE THE AS YOUR PREPAID CARRIER IT WORKS WELL WITH THEM, THE T-MOBILE ON WORKS A LITTLE SLOWER, AND INTERNET IS SLOW, BUT ALL IN ALL NOT T BAD, UNLESS THERE ARE NO TOWERS T-MOBILE WORKS OFF OF THE SERVICE AND BE TERRIBLE ALOT OF BREAKING AND DROPPED CALLS., BUT THERE ARE MORE PROS THAN CONS, SO I WOULD RECOMMENDTHIS PRODUCT.."
"Ulefone",1,"Only had it for 5 minutes it stop working the screen went out. Really loved this phone but I really want my money back"
"Ulefone",1,"This phone doesn't work good at all! It keeps shutting off and hanging up on people. Worst phone ever!!!!"
"Ulefone",5,"I love this phone! It took the place of my mega and looks and feels better toooo!!!!!!!"
"Ulefone",3,"thanks"
"Ulefone",4,"Really nice phone and really big also but the only down side is that is is really slow."
"Ulefone",5,"What's I expected 👍 thanks. Love it"
"Ulefone",2,"I did not have this phone 3 months. It started freezing up and turning off and on by itself. I had to order another phone."
"Ulefone",5,"I just got mine today and I gotta say its more than I expected....no glitches so far. Can't stop playing on it!Does anybody know what case I could buy to fit it?"
"Ulefone",3,"The phone works ok here and overseas but don't have the storage so you can't see email or text message until you delete things so that was a let down"
"Ulefone",1,"This phone is terrible. International model runs on 2g (T-Mobile) and the screen went dead a week after receiving it."
"Ulefone",2,"I LOVE THE WAY THE PHONE LOOKS BUT MY ONLY PROBLEM IS THE INTERNET SERVICE, ITS SLOOOOW! I CANT EVEN DOWNLOAD ANY APPS BECAUSE THE MARKET WONT LOAD.."
"Ulefone",5,"At first i hated the phone because i put my sim card in & it wouldnt read it .it took me about a week with this phone to figure out my sim card was in backwards. *face palm* Other than that ive had no problems , ive read all the other bad reviews & i was a little worried to get this phone but their was more good reviews than bad. i than got it . everyone asks where i got the phone and always say how big it is & how they like it. Its pretty fast i get signal everywhere. the only thing is if you use straight talk you cant recieve pics. their apn doesnt unlock pics.. but on the plus side i didn't realize when i bought it you can take screen shots when holding down the volume button & the power button at the same time.everything works great . im glad i got this phone its a good deal for the price"
"Ulefone",2,"i love the phone works very well. BUT now the pixals are messing up and i never drop the phone it does it very randomly also the ear peice is very low but other then that the phone is love"
"Ulefone",1,"Some things were good about this phone but some things were not. When scrolling it would be blurry till you stopped. Hurt the eyes. Too many weird things would pop up too that was not on my phone."
"Ulefone",1,"The phone looks great but the charger went out my battery never stayes charged. The headphones it came with was poor quality the charger also because it went out/stopped working. The size of the phone is great"
"Ulefone",1,"i bought this phone and when i first got it i had problems with hanging the phone up. When you call somebody the screen will go off so when you are done talking to them you have to wait on them to hang up. Also recently my volume went out i cant hear text messages or calls, and when people call me they can hear me but i am stuck saying HELLO, because i cant hear anything and i only had this phone a little over a month and now my return policy is out of date. Now that's money gone to waist and i have to try to save money to get an new phone."
"Ulefone",3,"The phone ring volume is so low even on high and there are no case to fit phone pad wow wat a waist should have stayed with boost mobile never received charger to pad"
"Ulefone",1,"loved the phone. I've had it a month and last night it just turned off. will not turn back on or charge. very upset."
"Ulefone",5,"GR8 PHONE!!!! All the benefits of a Samsung w.o the inflated price!! I love the screen size! Its bigger than the note 2/3 guys so it makes the viewing better, but harder to find really cool cases. All in all well worth the lack in accesories for the phone."
"Ulefone",5,"I ended up selling it to my brother. It was HUGE! I knew with a 6 inch screen it would be, but it seemed very bulky. He loves it though!"
"Ulefone",1,"Within a day I returned this phone back to Amazon. Nice screen but that's all. Poor internet service. Only allowed 2G network. Downloads were slow. This phone is good if you only plan to use it for Talk and text. Anything else it's a waste of money."
"Ulefone",5,"Great phone,totally worth it"
"Ulefone",5,"I have nothing bad to say.....my phone made it right on time.This is a very huge phone just what I wanted.... And also came with not one but two battery #winning"
"Ulefone",1,"Hate this phone had it for one day"
"Ulefone",5,"Please you didn't do good at this time by sending me a different phone because the phone is not pad phone and moreover is not up to 6"" Inch as I saw before ordering it. No cover like the one I have from you before. I'm now afraid to order from you because you would not send what I request for. Have a good day"
"Ulefone",1,"was not what they say good luck getting it to work"
"Ulefone",5,"Excelente.!"
"Ulefone",4,"There are only a couple problems with the phone.. 1) I can't turn off this extremely loud defining beep that goes off ever 30sec-1min. I tired to get help from the company but they never responded to my emails. The people on the other end of the phone conversation say they can hear it too which leads them to sometimes think its a call coming in on there end. 2) the camera is extremely touchy. You have to have it very still or shots will be blurred.3) internal memory is very low, you can only download a few apps. It reads storage space running low all the time after clearing everything. Other than that its not a bad phone."
"Ulefone",2,"Everything was fine until three week ago I turn my phone on and it was totally wacked up I've had the phone only six months I will not buy another one will be sticking with American made only"
"Ulefone",4,"Excelente"

"inDigi",4,"It's my first tablet (phablet) and it is little old, slow. But, I can always learn and find a use for it. Price was right. I haven't activated the phone yet, it's a GMS network phone and I'm still exploring providers. Somebody told me SEARS sold this make and model. It might be acting slow because the mobile data isn't activated yet. Happy."
"inDigi",4,"it is ok."

"Acer",1,"The description says 16GB rom, it only has 8GB rom. I am very disappointed at the erroneous and misleading description."
"Acer",2,"I had high hopes for this Acer phone based their reputation for laptops etc. It is a very well designed phone and it's well made but badly let down by two things.The Android operating is stuck at 4.4 with no hope of an update. The front (selfie) câmera which is supposed to be 5 MP is actually about a tenth of that (maybe .5) and very grainy. I checked twice to see if there was perhaps a plastic protective sheet covering the lens, but nothing.Asides from that, the phone works well and has clear calls, a nice screen and fast internet.The battery life is not enough, but all smartphones are the same in that area. I have become accustomed to carrying around a battery pack.All in all, a nice phone let down by the totally unacceptable front camera and out-of-date operating system. Its going back!"

"Acer",3,"this phone was a replacement for my niece, hers broke down. The shipping was fast. It took her a while to get use to the windows phone, in the beginning she complain a lot. And she was right because the display isn't that big, the rim is about 1 inch and if you use to work with a full display the bottom is annoying and the speaker didn't work that well (the other side couldn't hear you clearly) I think it was a glitch of windows 8.1. But overall it a good phone for my niece because she's broke two expensive smart phone. So this one is just right price for a teenager like her. Till now this phone with stand her rudeness and carelessly."
"Acer",5,"Dual Sims are better than one sim has blurred data!"
"Acer",5,"Nice phone. I am waiting to be upgraded to Windows 10"
"Acer",1,"I did not receive my order items."
"Acer",1,"First off, great service as usual. I wanted a small Windows Phone and had seen this phone at the MS store. I liked the look, and thought it would work. First off, there are no directions for inserting the SIM card. Why would you need directions you ask? Because after ten minutes of dinking with it I realized that SIM1 on this phone is a ""full-size"" SIM card! Who has those anymore? So, I had to put my SIM card in the SIM2 slot. When I did that, every call I made required me to select SIM2 over SIM1. Also, it was taking way to long for all my apps to load. Ridiculously too long. But the nail in the coffin for this phone was the screen. It's awful. You have to tilt the phone just right to see the screen clearly. Just a little angle from any direction and it like your looking through one of those PC security screens from the 80's. One other reason I was interested in the phone was the textured case; I thought it would be easier to grip. Not. It's slipperier than the smooth case on my Lumina 635, which I'd use all the time if it had a front facing camera. Anyway, if any on you know of a good Windows phone with a 4"" screen I'd appreciate your feedback."
"Acer",5,"Excelente Producto"
"Acer",4,"Item is good. The only thing is AT&T does will no longer provide 2G network service"
"Acer",4,"It's work well"
"Acer",1,"manure"
"Acer",5,"My 14 year old bought this with his babysitting money, not for a phone, but as a mini-computer with a texting app to text his friends (from wi-fi, as he has no data for it). He really likes it. The only regret is that he knew ahead of time it was a Windows system but now wishes it was an android. This is not the fault of the company--he knew when he bought it. Overall, he likes it."
"Acer",1,"The phones were advertised as being ""Windows 10 Ready"", this couldn't be farther from the truth. The minute we tried to download Windows 10 we received an error message saying that it was not possible to do on that phone. We promptly sent them back."
"Acer",4,"excellent"
"Acer",1,"phone very poor quality. I recommend not to buy"
"Acer",3,"It'sn a powerfull phone."
"Acer",5,"nice phone i like it"
"Acer",5,"This is the best budget phone you can get in my honest opinion, it has it all, a Quad-core processor, 2gb Ram, 16gb ROM, good looking, it feels good in your hand.the camera is not the greatest but, is pretty good for this price.The software run pretty smoothly and fast, I've installed a lot of apps with no problems at all.The only downside is the battery life, but it's not a big deal."

"AKUA",5,"This phone seems pretty excellent for the money. Only had it 2 days, and set it up with Tracfone (who are clueless and it was a nightmare) but now that that is done it seems great. It could die in a week, but so far, so great!Update: had a problem with an SD card, but it seems the card itself was the problem. This phone does the job. Its not an iPhone, but it also hasn't got the pricetag. It does what I need and is reliable. Wifi works well. Great value."

"Alcatel",2,"CONNECTION ON PHONE CALLS IS TERRIBLE, DOES NOT KEEP TRACK OF CALLS WITH DUAL SIMS, DOES NOT ALWAYS SCREEN MIRROR.... MANY MANY ISSUES"
"Alcatel",4,"BUY A CASE, BUY A CASE BUY A CASE! every revier and unboxing I saw when this phone came out showed one included - WRONG. The phone is awesome but more slippery than a fish. Had is less than a week and both sides cracked while in my FSfjxrhdyxING pocket........."
"Alcatel",4,"Nice phone, fast but it heat up very quick and cool down quick too."
"Alcatel",5,"Easily the best phone I've ever used. Great price point but even better performance and image quality of the screen and sound quality from speakers. Will stick with this phone for a while unless Alcatel can somehow find a way to out do the Idol 4s."
"Alcatel",5,"thank u alcatel i love it"
"Alcatel",5,"UPDATED....After 1 month....this is still a great phone. This is replacing my Galaxy S5. I also have an iPhone 6 which I use for work. I have also used the HTC ONE X+, HTC M9, LG G3, Moto G3 and Honor 5X. The Idol 4S is a great phone, it is very thin and has a beautiful build. Battery life has been great....easily 12+ hours, waaaaaay longer if you're not killing it with games all day. Stand by/idol time is amazing. Total ""screen on time"" for me is around 4-1/2 hours with checking emails, texting, you tube, reading news, music, some casual gaming (examples: SSG3, SkyForce reloaded, Words, Fieldrunners 2, Smash Hit, Defense Zone 3) for a total of 12+ hours use. It also recharges very fast. The display is AWESOME...even outside in the sun is no problem. Better than all of the above mentioned phones. Not sure if the screen is gorilla glass...I have no scratches yet and I don't use a screen protector. I've watched many reviews of this phone before buying. Most of them complain about the fingerprint scanner. There is really nothing wrong with it. It is very comparable in speed to my iPhone 6 and registers the same number of times....about 98% of the time. I actually think its a little better than the iPhone 6 fingerprint scanner. The sound is awesome on this phone whether you use headphones or not. I have not had any issues with AT&T cell signal, GPS, or bluetooth. No problem with bluetooth connecting to my car or my home A/V receiver. I ALWAYS use Nova Launcher on every Android phone in my family, and the Idol 4S is no exception. This phone with the 652 processor and 3 gig ram handles everything easily. The phone runs super smooth...no lagging. And this phone comes with decent JBL headphones, screen protector, and VR headset (VR is pretty cool). Overall a great buy but I think $350 might be a better price. It's a definite buy either way. You will not be disappointed."
"Alcatel",5,"Coming from an Asus Zenfone 2, this smartphone charges super fast. The screen is super crisp vibrant colors and with a VR, JBL headphones and a faux tempered screen protector can't go wrong with the package on this phone."
"Alcatel",5,"I broke my Iphone 6 plus and I was not willing to pay $750+++ for a new Apple phone. I have to admit I was a little leery of this phone given the fact that I am a long time Apple user. After some careful research I decided on the Alcatel IDOL 4S. It is much more affordable and still delivers the high end experience I was looking for. So far I am extremely happy with the purchase and would highly recommend anyone to give this phone a shot. In terms of speed my IDOL 4S is noticeably faster on the web in the same environment as my Iphone 6 plus. In terms of battery I could barely get through half a day on my Iphone with heavy use. My IDOL 4S ends the day with between 30% and 40% of power left with the same kind of usage. When you do need to charge it has some technology that charges the phone super fast called “quick charge 2.0”. I take a ton of pictures with my phone and I love the fact that this phone offers a flash on the front and rear sides of the phone. The ability to expand the memory on the phone with a micro SD card is a huge plus to me because I keep so many pictures on my phone. I rarely listen to music through my phone's internal speakers, however this phone has two speakers on it! (One on the top of the phone and one on the bottom.) I compared it to my iphone and it's a huge difference. You get a surround sound affect and it is much louder than any of my other phones. I haven't tried out the VR googles yet, but the JBL headphones that come with it are surprisingly good quality. Alcatel also throws in a screen protector, making this phone a complete package. I am an AT&T customer and they have an app called ""AT&T mobile transfer"" that literally takes minutes to transfer all your contacts, videos, and pictures from your original device to your new device. So easy to use and it doesn't matter if you are going from Apple to Android based. 5 stars across the board, VERY satisfied customer!"
"Alcatel",5,"This device is fire '. It's nice from its nice battery life to its camera. Its VR goggles is OK nothing that will blow you a way. Its worth its price from screen to design."
"Alcatel",2,"I bought many phones of this model for friends and for my use. All of them were working perfect at the first months. Couple of months later problems came with them. Mine one used to restart during phone conversations. Contact and other applicaions give error and I have to close them. Alarm mode does not works. If I try a phone call it takes long to beep or dialing. Not factory unlocked to uninstall app not needed. I had the first model and GPS works great, this one not. So I would not recomend this model. The big problem looks like to be a model manufactured exclusively for T-Mobil and Metro PCS. If they are used out from USA there are not posibilities to update when updates are available. I have done root and any how the same problem with update. My last problem at the time."
"Alcatel",1,"The phone hangs up after I speak for five minutes. I've only had it less than 6 months. I would not recommend."

"Alcatel",2,"The Alcatel phone is nice but they are cheaply made, that's why they are so inexpensive. The prongs inside the phone where you plug in the charging cable are cheaply made and tend to bend and break. The volume on the phone leaves a lot to be desired. The phone lasted about 6 months."

"Alcatel",2,"Not FACTORY unlocked!!!Metro PCS phone. After 2 two days of my time and internet searching the phone is now usable after properly unlocking and rooting.Phone comes with Metro PCS bloatware (unneeded useless junk) installed.

The phone i bought was a T Mobile phone, I can only get it to work on T Mobile towers. There coverage sucks. My Carrier is straight talk, I can't get the APN settings to change to Straight talk. My advice just buy the phone from the carrier you use. The seller of this phone best Tech express has poor customer service!!!!"

Very satisfied with this purchase especially at the price!"
"Alcatel",5,"Genial. Puntuales y responsables."
"Alcatel",4,"The Alcatel Fierce 2 is nice phone since I am using this phone for more that an year. Sound quality is pretty good also the hands free speaker. Sensitivity of the touch screen also very good. 4GB memory is good enough to multitask and installing many apps if needed. The only think I didn't like is the thickness of the phone."
"Alcatel",1,"Bought this supposedly unlocked phone for use when I travel to the Caribbean. Discovered today that it was ""bricked up"" by T-Mobile. The following error message appeared on a black screen:""Security Error:This phone has been flashed with unauthorized software & is locked. Call your mobile operator for additional support. Please note that repair/return for this issue may have additional cost.""So, I am stuck with a useless phone and $109 poorer."
"Alcatel",3,"Ok 4 the price but if you're used to better phones like LG, Samsung, or HTC it's gonna be crappy.But it works and doesn't lag or anything. And isn't to shabby on speed either. Camera is garbage. Audio playback is actually good. Screen nice n clear."
"Alcatel",5,"Bought a used Alcatel OneTouch Fierce 2. Arrived in 2 shipping days! Looks brand new, works perfect! I had the Onetouch I originally but it broke; this truly lives up to be called the OneTouch's predecessor! Both outperform many of the more famous (ex Galaxy, IPhone) and expensive phones, for a MUCH lower price! A must for any traveling person who relies on phone! (flashlight, compass, GPS, texting, internet, APP support, and good CPU/RAM)!! Thank you 5*"

"Alcatel",1,"the phone has problems to activate"
"Alcatel",1,"Restarts or shuts down on it's own several time a day. Takes about 5 minutes to start up after this. Can freeze and restart while doing something. Google maps never worked for more than 5 minutes before closing. Doesn't deserve even a single star. Total waste of money, plain junk."

"Alcatel",5,"I liked the phone but I phone signal disappointed because I expected to have a signal 4g in Venezuela because several friends have the same cell and if the signal rises 4g but not mine. the seller treated me well and I sent the code to unlock the phone"
"Alcatel",4,"Would be 5 Stars except its a T Mobile phone, seller needs to clarify this, other than that the phone is a very good deal for the price. Pictures quality for the price is good, easy to set up and operate. Has a lot of apps that are useful , call quality is good.Overall you cant be the price , If you looking for an inexpensive this one will work well for you, I use Straight Talk and had no problems setting this phone up and its worked beyond expectations based on some of the reviews. You will need to cut down your Standard SIM card for this phone"

"Alcatel",4,"Review after 4 days:Pro:-Speakers are bananas-Pulling down the top bar shows a quick preview. Pull down again to show more settings.-Speakers on both sides (on top and bottom).-Battery is fantastic upon buying (great once you start downloading apps). Usually, l phones drain at an average rate and then at 20% it magically drops to 0 in no time. This drains slowly without magical drops even when I have WiFi on and using Spotify and pinterest at the same time at 4%. Good stuff.-Less bloatware: Avg antivirus, Facebook, twitter, chrome, drive, google+, hangouts, weather, WiFi transfer, adobe reader, (NFC) tags, radio, WiFi display, YouTube.-Design of app buttons - not outdated looking.-Pros say the display is meh but it looks good to me.-Double tap screen to wake up. Good if laying flat so you don't have to pick up to press power button.-Don't need to sign in password to access basic pull down settings.-If your phone dies, all the apps open when you turn on, like a computer. Nice-You can uninstall factory apps that are not run by Google. Deleted FB and Twitter, but can't delete YouTube. (Almost) for the win.Meh:-Music: songs overlap 5 secs so you know what song is next.-Camera is acceptable.-Option to pick up in any orientation. I don't need this feature but if your oober lazy/clumsy I guess this could work for you.-Power button is on left and volume is on right. Weird but okay.-Quick access to certain buttons when wake up from sleep like camera, messages, etc.Con:-UI is not intuitive like Apple/Samsung.-Lacks a lot of settings options. No universal settings button like on Samsung.-There's no main home page like on Samsung; when you press the home button, it goes to the last page you were on.-Design of buttons: instead of a backwards play button for 'go back' it is an upside down triangle. Home is a circle instead of a house. Showing all open apps is a square. As a designer, this bugs me because they have no correlation...unless they do corrolate in China.-A sealed battery.-Bottom button bar takes up far too much space and makes screen smaller.-Have to tap each text to the time stamp.-About 4 hrs after unboxing, checked music settings and pressing a song to play in library, it often skips over that song. Sometimes over 1, sometimes as much as six. O thought maybe it was the file type but if you press the backward button (next to pause, not the main), or select play next in queue and press fast forward, it will play. Annoying. Hopefully putting the songs I want into playlists will solve this, unless it skips those too.All in all, acceptable for under $200 compared to iPhone and samsung. I mean really, we are all spoiled. All you really need is call, text, and camera. Use a tablet or computer for all the app bull. Would still rather my SG-S4 because of the user interface, but I get what I need here. (My S4 just up and died on me. Won't turn on. Survived for 3 wks without it)"
"Alcatel",5,"I know this may sound funny to many people, but this phone reminds me a lot of iPhone 6. They both have similar dimension and the same screen size. The Idol 3's build quality is very good and it just doesn't feel like a budget phone. I absolutely love the screen for its resolution and color. This came from someone who have used LG G4 and Motorola Moto X and Moto G. This phone is not the fastest out there but it is smooth enough for every day use. I didn't experience any delay so far unlike BLU Life One 4G LTE (2015) which I returned for sluggish performance. I would recommend Alcatel ONETOUCH IDOL 3 4.7"" to anyone who doesn't like all those huge 5.5"" phones out there but rather has a small easy to handle phone."
"Alcatel",2,"Lasted less than a month.I went to sleep one night with the phone on the included USB charger. When I woke up, I noticed it was glitching very badly between my PIN lock screen and the home screen dashboard. My touches did not register. I couldn't even make it go into a hard reset.Fast forward one hour later -- it had stopped holding a charge. The phone died pretty hard and at a time I was least expecting it.Fast forward some more -- I attempt to RMA the phone. Their website isn't very intuitive when it comes to finding a repair center. Eventually I find their US repair center. I start filling out the forms, but then I realized I couldn't grab my phone's IMEI and chalked it up as a $175+ loss. Fortunately I have the budget to grab a new phone, but that's still a lot of money to spend on a phone just to have it stop working after a month of moderate use.It's a shame, because for the price, it's a snappy little phone. I liked their UI, and it was fairly close to stock Android. Way better than anything with Touchwiz shoved on it, that's for sure. The camera wasn't that great, but I was willing to live with that. I may grab another one just because I liked the UI so much, but I am going to be very weary and much more proactive about keeping the proper warranty info.Maybe it would just be worth getting a Moto G instead."
"Alcatel",5,"Exceptional phone for the price. Lightweight, thin, bright screen. loud and clear speakers front speakers. Process is reasonably responsive. Works with your Google voice number, unlike Asus Zenfone 2."
"Alcatel",5,"This phone is great for anyone looking for an inexpensive, yet high performing, smartphone."
"Alcatel",5,"Pros-Smooth Performance-All Day Battery Life-Excellent Build Quality-Good Quality Screen-NFC (Android Pay Compatible)-Decent Camera-MicroSD ExpansionCons-Awkward Button Placement-Squeaky Vibrating Motor-Updates not guaranteed-No Gorilla GlassShould you buy: YESActual Value: $220I loved my Moto G. It made me always question why people spend over $600 on phones when a $200 could work just as well. With the new Moto G, I was willing to buy it right on the spot. But what turned me off was the nearly 3 weeks I’d have to wait for one to be delivered. So I started my search for the next best phone under $200, which lead me to this phone. I’ve had some experience with Alcatel phones, so I didn’t have much expectations with this phone. That being said, I’ve had a couple of days with it and I can say with absolute confidence that I love it.-Design-This is one light phone. I’m starting with that because you have no idea how light it is until you hold it in your hand. I actually thought for a moment that the battery wasn’t inside it yet. But it is pleasant to hold in the hand. The design is all plastic, so don’t expect anything premium on this phone like metal. But it is solidly built, rivaling even the Galaxy S5 in build quality. Speaking of which, this phone is lighter and slimmer than the S5. If the phone were sold for more money, I’d still be satisfied. It’s not just good build quality for the price. It’s excellent build quality. Period. The chrome accent is a nice touch and the speaker grills are slightly angled towards the phone, which add a bit of sparkle to an otherwise black phone. No soft touch plastic on this phone, but it does land on a middle ground where the plastic is nice to touch and is resistant to fingerprints. The design is completely symmetrical, which is important for a certain feature that is unique to it. I’d love it even more if it were available in a different color such as white, but that is personal preference. Overall, I can’t find much to complain; especially for the low $180 price.-Performance-If you have seen the Moto G’s specs, you’re pretty much getting the same hardware. It uses a Snapdragon 410, 720p display, microSD expansion, Android Lollipop, and even the same camera module (Sony IMX 214). However, there are a few key difference that make this a better phone than the Moto G. For instance, this phone has 1.5 GB of RAM (Moto G=1GB), actual front facing stereo speakers, a 4.7” compared to the 5”, NFC, and 16GB of storage(Moto G=1GB). In benchmarks, I have gotten similar results to the Moto G in both CPU and graphic performance. But benchmarks are only one side of the performance experience. The other is daily user experience. Based on the couple of days with it and after installing many apps, I can tell you that this phone is snappy. It’s not as fast as the current flagship lineup, but it never lags or clips the graphics. Apps open relatively quickly and the animations are smooth, as well as the transitions from one app to another. In my testing of multitasking ability, it opened Chrome, Angry Birds, Pokemon Puzzle, and YouTube with no lag and each app open where I left them off. Opening more will force the phone to suspend one of those apps to save RAM, but 4 apps at once without closing is pretty good for the cost. Games also perform good, as long as you have reasonable expectations. 2D games such as Angry Birds, Pokemon Puzzle, and Clash of Clans run smoothly and without an issue. Other games like Asphalt 8 and Real Racing 3 will run smooth, but not at the highest quality setting. But that’s to be expected from a midrange phone. Signal quality is good. I was able to get 62 Mbps download speed and 8 Mbps upload on T-Mobile’s 4G LTE around Pasadena, CA. Thanks to band 12 support, cell signal in buildings is good with the signal almost never going under 3 bars. The speakers are also amazingly good and loud, coming close to matching HTC’s Boomsound phone speakers thanks to the help from JBL. Overall, it performs close to flagship specs, albeit a bit slower. Most people should be happy with this phone.-Display-The phone itself has a beautiful HD display with a 312 PPI (note that the iPhone 6 has a 324 PPI) and it is advertise as being calibrated by Technicolor. While they aren’t at the S6’s quality display, it does come close. The display has a nice color calibration, with vivid colors and nice blacks and whites. It is also bright enough for using even in direct sunlight and the good contrast means you can clearly see what you are doing. It isn’t perfect since there are a couple of issues. The colors do have a VERY slight cool tone, meaning that the whites do have a TINY bit of blue to them. Another small issue is that there is a slight amount of light bleed on one side of the displace. But it isn’t noticeable in daily use and it is good for the price of the phone. One crucial one is the fact that they aren’t using Gorilla glass on this display, opting for the more discreet Dragontrail Glass. Since this is going to be my daily driver, I didn’t want to test the toughness (if Alcatel provides me a unit, I’d gladly test it) but I’ve looked into it and it trades scratch resistance for toughness. It might be easier to scratch it, but it is more resistant to shock. Only time will tell and I will update this review as time moves on.-Camera-The camera is a back-facing 13 MP camera and a front, wide angle 5 MP camera. The rear camera uses a Sony Exmor IMX 214, which is the same unit found in the new Moto G and the more expensive Nexus 6. The results are mixed though. On one side, outdoor pictures are good. Whenever there is good lighting such as outside or a well lit room, the pictures do come out high quality with colors mostly accurate and the camera absorbing a lot of details. However, during the night, the picture quality takes a hit, with the camera struggling to get any details from the lack of light. It will get some details if they is ANY type of light, but not much. The lack of OIS also contributes to this issue, but there is no phone with OIS at this price range at the moment. The flash is okay, but since it isn’t a dual tone unit, the light tends to overflow and photos tend to lose their details. Videos are also a similar story, with good lighting providing good results and the opposite being true. There is EIS, but the effect isn’t that noticeable and it doesn’t really help with the quality. This isn’t a camera you’re going to use for important, memorable moments. But for things that most people use, like Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram, it works great. This is especially true for the front facing camera, with the selfie cam grabbing a lot of details, provided there is good amount of light.-Software-This is basically running a close to stock version of Android Lollipop. It is running version 5.0.2 with a Stagefright patch already added to protect the phone from foreign attacks. There are a few changes to the software. For instance, the icons look like similar to the iPhone, which can be both a good and bad thing, depending on whether you love or hate that style. Other than that, everything works just like stock Android. Except for one feature that I’m surprised isn’t universal to all phones. That is the fact that this phone is reversible. It doesn’t sound as exciting as fingerprint sensor, but it is a rather practical and underrated feature. I’ve answered the phone to test the sound quality and it wasn’t until after I hung up that I realized the phone was upside down. It sounds equally good on either orientation and it is brilliant. Of course, if you don’t like this (for some reason) there is always the option to turn it off. Overall, the light touch that Alcatel added onto Android hasn’t hurt it much and any problems can be easily fixed.-Conclusion-I wasn’t expecting to get a high quality phone, especially after my experience with an old model that I can’t even remember the name. But Alcatel did deliver a high quality experience and an astonishing device. It does have some compromises, but Alcatel chose them wisely and the overall result is great. There is a couple of phones that compete in this range, but the biggest one is the Moto G. Is this better? Yes and no. For power users, I would still recommend the high end Moto G because of the extra RAM or even a OnePlus One, which is on sale now for $299. But if it must be under $200, like for college students like me, this beats the $179 low end Moto G due to the higher quality speakers, display, NFC, and the slightly more RAM. This phone helps to answer the question: Do people really need to spend over $800 on a phone to get a high quality experience? The answer for most people is no. They don’t. There is a market for people who need to have the latest and greatest with all the new extras like fingerprint sensor and DSLR-like quality cameras. But for the rest of us, there are phone that does what we ask from it and reasonably well not just for the price, but just overall. If you are on the fence and frustrated from searching like I was, let me help you. Go for this phone and you won’t be disappointed."
"Alcatel",2,"The rubber inner-sleeve does not look good on the phone."
"Alcatel",5,"So far so good, awesome speakers on a little phone, can't beat the price"
"Alcatel",5,"As of late I've been on something of a ""phone journey"". I first purchased an Idol 3 5.5"", but the phone was just too darn big to be practical (at least for me). I returned it, and then picked up the new Moto G 2015 (which I also did a review on). It was an excellent phone, but in the end I discovered it was missing some key features that I really needed in a daily driver device.First, the Moto G was missing a notification LED. Sure, some of you may think ""who cares, it has Moto display"", but there are times where this just isn't optimal. When the phone was on my desk and I happened to miss a notification (which normally flashed 3 times, but sometimes just once, probably bugged), to find out I even had one I had to either 1.) reach across the desk and wave my hand over the device, 2.) pick it up which would activate the screen (which didn't always work, either), or 3.) physically hit the power button. A notification LED eliminates the need for all of that fuss. That light is going to blink until I check/clear my notifications, for me this is PERFECT!Moto G is also missing a gyroscope. Not overly important to me (most of the time), but this is useful for things such as 360 degree YouTube videos, certain games, etc. Another win for Alcatel!Moto G doesn't include a magnetometer. Wanna use a compass app on the Moto G? Too bad, so sad. Alcatel 3 - Motorola 0.No NFC on the Moto G. Wanna pay using Android Pay in the future? Well, you can't do that with the Moto G! Idol 3 strikes again!Only 8GB internal storage on the similarly priced Moto G. What's that? You want 16GB for 179.99? Don't worry, Alcatel has you covered.Moto G only offers 1GB RAM on the 179.99 model. While 1GB is ""sufficient"" with careful usage, I'll gladly take 1.5GB for the same price, thanks Idol 3!The screen. While their resolutions are the same (1280 x 720), the Idol 3 4.7"" sports a 312 PPI pixel density, while the Moto G only comes in at 294. More pixels? More clarity? Yup! I'll take it!Dual front facing speakers with JBL sound? They sound absolutely amazing. The Moto G at least had the decency to have its only speaker on the front, but there is zero contest here. These speakers sound just as good as the ones from the 5.5"" Idol 3!While there are more positives, I just wanted to lay out the comparisons between the Idol 3 4.7"" and the Moto G 2015 1GB model, as these are the most often compared devices. In my honest opinion, there is zero contest between the two and I feel that Alcatel did an amazing job on this device. At first I was a bit leery of the 1.2Ghz Quad Core CPU, but I've had zero issues with lollipop and everything is buttery smooth! I fully recommend this to anyone, as it is well worth the price of admission!"

"Alcatel",5,"It's good"
"Alcatel",1,"in all honesty were is it its not in the mailbox or outside very disappointed"
"Alcatel",3,"Odd feel. The basic reason for a phone is to talk right? This is the worst flaw in the phone. I had a hard time answering and placing phone calls. The phone seems to have a long pause at the oddest times. I am glad after one month this phone was ruined by water. I would hate to put up with this phone for 2 years."
"Alcatel",4,"Best deal on an android phone, fast responsive, stereo front speakers sound great and battery life is very good, overall look and feel of this phone excellent. Screen is sharp with good color tones."
"Alcatel",5,"Nice"
"Alcatel",4,"For the first two weeks before the update it reboots just idling but now ok. Just make sure you get your settings keyed in correctly."
"Alcatel",5,"It's a great smartphone at a super affordable price! I was looking for a reliable budget smartphone to purchase for my parents, who were learning to use smartphones for the first time. So something basic with a long battery life was ideal. After looking intensively at budget smartphones, I narrowed my choices down to the Alcatel OneTouch or the Moto G (3rd Gen). I was ultimately swayed by the Alcatel because they had the 4.7"" screen size option and I am glad it worked out well.It was very easy to learn and use, great camera, decent battery life, and my mom loves it. The only comment I have to add, is the limited options for changing the language. There were a couple of options, but Chinese was not one of them. If language settings are a top concern for purchasing this phone, I would suggest you to find out what options you would need. (I know the Moto G offers a couple more languages, including Chinese.) Otherwise, I have no other complaints. I would even consider getting this phone for myself!"
"Alcatel",5,"I love this phone. I don't know what other smart phones do that cost 5x more than the Idol 3. I like it to fit in my shirt pocket. It is thin and not too heavy in this era monster phone screen sizes. It looks great, but most people put their phone in some dopey protector case, so what is the big deal with the chrome and glimmery looks except on the commercials and in the show room. But this phone looks high class anyway. I hate to cover it up in a case. All operations are a ""GO"". One neg., and I was aware of this from Android phone reviewers - the camera. It takes great photos EXCEPT for back lit shots, then the photos turn out like you took the photo in a light fog. I got this phone, because I need a PHONE' so the camera I can give or take. For 99% of the camera shots it's totally fine."
"Alcatel",5,"My prior phones were a galaxy s3 and LG G3 stylus. Both phones were great but this Alcatel one touch idol 4.7 is amazing. A little smaller than what I was hoping for, about the size of an iPhone 6, but it works smoothly and perfectly. Couldn't ask for a better phone. I currently use straight talk so all I had to do was literally insert my Sim and configure the Internet apn settings and within 5 minutes, the phone works, data works, texting and mms works amazing. Only complaint is when I'm on the phone with someone, I can't really hear then that well. But if your like me and all you do is text or surf the Web, this phone is perfect for you. Also, the front speaker(s) is amazing. Sound is very clear and honestly the best I have ever had."
"Alcatel",5,"Love this phone!"
"Alcatel",1,"This would have been a great phone, except it keeps loosing network connectivity randomly (especially during phone calls) and I often have to speak very loudly in order to have the person on the other end of the call hear what I'm saying.All in all, a big disappointment."
"Alcatel",5,"Best versatile phone out there. Has a lot of upgraded features from it's past generations but the idol 3 has came along way in a view of a flagship inexpensive phone. I love the phone and how it is gsm unlocked. Well done Alcatel. I'm curious if Alcatel is going to come out with a new generation of one touch."
"Alcatel",5,"This device was really enjoyed to use and everything about it was pretty good if I had any gripe it would have to be the bubbly icon but that's just nitpicking. For more information on this device please search for Eric Drummond on YouTube"
"Alcatel",5,"Great phone for the money. Only had it 2 days but loving it so far."
"Alcatel",4,"Trust me this is a good phone.I habmve used and owned nexus 5, one plus one, galaxy s5, htc m8.....ipad air 2 chromebook laptop........I love it stuff and this is a good phoneI have read all the reviews here but ill write the best one.Pros.Size. Weight. Portablity. Right screen. Great speakers. Price. Good battery life. Pretty quick charging time.Cons. A little slow (but get used it)Touch pad is not great when typing stuff. I think that alcatel used the cheap screen panel.No haptic feedback when using touch screen for writing and texting.Some bugs that can be fixed but the alcatel seems like they dont support the device much.No android 6.0Cant pair with Bluetooth all the time. Idk why..I think that this phone is way better than galaxy alpha and a3.For moto g...... if you like a big heavy phone then get it..... moto g is a slighly faster but i think alCatel is better.......Ask me anything about this phone."
"Alcatel",3,"This phone was bought by my father for my step-mother. My dad does lots of research before buying new phones...because he wants a cheaper phone, with decent reviews. This past weekend, my step mother had to reach out to me to ask how to display her contacts as they were not automatically joined with the transfer from her old phone. It was an easy fix, but a frustrating solution none the less. There is no Swype functionality either, so I had to download the google swype keyboard to provide that functionality for her. Other than a few other minor usability things, the phone has a nice feel to it, the apps are familiar looking and as long as you have some smart phone knowledge, the phone is fairly easy to navigate."
"Alcatel",5,"The phone is awesome for the price so worth it. It's perfect hand size but the 5.5"" screen would be nicer, but for the extra $70- 80 or w.e. the difference is. It was out of my personal budget"
"Alcatel",5,"Here’s why I went with the Acatel Idol 3 at 4.7 inches over the 3rd Gen Moto G. Both at $179.Size: Idol is 4.7 inches vs. Moto is 5.0 inches. I’m done with big phones. I wish everyone else would be too so we can start seeing more 4.5 - 4.7 inch phones with the latest specs, but that’s not going to happen anytime soon…Internal capacity: Idol has 16 GB vs. Moto’s 8 GB for same price. Both have micro SD so maybe internal capacity doesn’t matter to people.RAM: 1.5 GB vs. 1.0 GBDisplay: 312 ppi vs. 294 ppiNFC: yes vs. no. Looking forward to trying out the NFC tags. For $10 bucks it’s worth a look.Sound: Stereo speakers vs. single; JBL speakers vs. who knows, JBL headphones included vs. noneMicrophone: dual vs. single; You can use the Idol in either orientation.Customization: no vs. yesWeight: 110 grams vs. 155 gramsBattery: 2000 mAh vs. 2470Water resistance: no vs. yesSimilar Snapdragon 4101.2 GHz vs. 1.4 GHzSimilar Camera - 13 MP back, 5 MP frontBottom line for the Idol 3:16 GB, 1.5 GB RAM, slightly better screen, lighter, little smaller, little thinner, dual speakers and microphones.It's thin, light, and fast with a nice crisp screen.I don’t care about customization or water resistance."
"Alcatel",3,"So far so good. Needed a stopgap for my old Nexus 5 since the battery has died by noon everyday in recent weeks. I've tried a few of the 5.5"" mid-range phones that have been released recently and none of them seem to be right for me. I just can't seem to get used to using a larger phone. Started using this phone 2 days ago and it's been great so far.No stuttering at all, and has kept the same pace as my Nexus did, yet the battery has lasted albeit with weekend usage. The standby on this phone is Apple-esqe, I left it off the charger overnight and lost 2% of battery life. I'll get a chance to see what normal business use will get me today.The speakers on this phone are some of the best I've ever heard on a smart phone. Loud and clear. I don't normally use my phone speaker as I will connect to a bluetooth speaker in the house, but it's not really needed any longer.Phone feels very solid in the hand for a phone that is entirely plastic, but it is VERY light.For $175 this phone is a bargain so far.*Edit* Not sure if its just a bad handset or an issue with this phone but when connected to a call via Bluetooth I hear a loud clicking noise. Sounds a bit like a helicopter over the call. Tried it in my car and with 2 sets of Bluetooth headphones, all three have the same sound. It's a shame was loving this phone."
"Alcatel",3,"UPDATE November 2016 -I have downgraded my rating of this phone due to a system update patch dated November 1, 2016. This update kills the functionality of the 'tap to wake' feature that lets you tap on the screen to wake it up. This is a WONDERFUL feature that I loved on this phone. But this feature was largely killed with the November 2016 update. It now only works MAYBE 5% of the time I tap the screen to wake it. This is a REALLY obnoxious killing of a great feature. If Alcatel eliminates great features like this after purchase it eliminates my trust in the company and I would not buy an Alcatel product in the future because of this. I don't particularly care if this was intentional or is just a bug. They sent an update patch that changed something I don't want changed. That's a screw up and I'm not happy.░░░░░GOOD PHONE / OKAY CAMERA░░░░░I got this for my wife to replace the Galaxy S6 we bought a few months ago. Turns out that phone was just too darn big. The Idol 3 4.7"" version ends up being perfectly sized for a normal person’s hand.This is a nice phone in general. It's a great phone when you factor in the price and overall value. With the hardware being so capable for such a reasonable price this phone could be a game changer for the Smartphone industry, forcing the major players to bring pricing down. I said the same thing about the 5.5"" version of the Idol 3 a few months ago and with the popularity that device and the ASUS ZenFone 2 are enjoying in this price range, I am convinced you'll see more reasonably priced phones from the major market players in the next 2 years.░░░░░THE GOOD░░░░░❖ The sound - The front facing JBL speakers make this a solid rival to the HTC One M9. If you use your phone for multi media like watching videos or listening to music without headphones this is a solid sound system for you. The sound is vibrant and most importantly it's loud. And it's clear sound. It doesn't sound like a tiny cell phone speaker. It sounds like a real speaker. The HTC One product line made the front facing speakers it's calling card and no one really challenged the HTC design until now. The Alcatel OneTouch Idol 3 stands toe to toe with the HTC One sound and doesn't flinch.❖ It physically looks like a nice phone, not a cheap off brand.❖ It's not the most powerful processor in a Smartphone, and it's a little lower powered than the 5.5"" variant but it's plenty good enough to drive the Idol 3 for normal daily use. I didn't find it to be laggy at all doing normal stuff. Through all of the set up process and a couple hours of use there was no lag.❖ It has expandable storage! Thank you for keeping this feature in a smart phone. I hate the cloud. I want to have my files on my device. The Idol 3 starts at 16GB on board (not all usable as the system takes up some of that) but it's expandable up to 128GB via the tried and true SD card method. So you can expand the storage significantly for $20-$50. Meanwhile some of the higher end Smartphones will charge you more than the entire purchase price of the Idol 3 to increase from a 32GB base model to a 128GB model.❖ The HD 4.7"" display is VERY nice. The colors are vibrant. They may be slightly more vibrant than true life colors, but it works. Photos look richer, even if you don't get true life coloring. All the rendered graphics look fantastic due to the rich color depth. (Meaning stuff like your icons and games and the UI interface, etc etc). The resolution is a little lower than the 5.5"" version, but the screen is also smaller so it's not very noticeable. This phone sas the same resolution as the 30 inch HDTV in my bedroom.❖ The back is flat! I like to lay my phone down on a desk or table next to me and be able to use it for things like checking a sports score or just checking off a notification or something. With a rounded back on the phone it will wobble and be annoying. The Idol 3 has a flat back so it lays flat on the table and doesn't wobble when you touch it. This is such a simple thing but it's HUGE for me.❖ It’s SUPER thin. (See my picture with comparison next to my finger) It’s thinner than my Galaxy S4, with just a slightly smaller screen. (Its’ significantly smaller than screen on the Galaxy S6 we sold) And it’s very light weight.❖ The camera was an initial area of concern for me. Everything looked over exposed and blurry. This was largely fixed with an alternate camera app (more on that later). It's still not the greatest camera in the world, but I have to factor in the price tag on the phone. For $180 it's a good enough camera. In high light (outdoors in day time) it's actually pretty decent. In low light (anytime you need the flash) it's not so hot.░░░░░THE BAD░░░░░❖ The stock camera app is complete garbage in all aspects. You can improve the photo quality a little by adjusting the manual settings, but you lose the settings as soon as you restart the app. It doesn't save them. On the stock settings everything is massively overexposed with the light balance making everything look blue. This almost caused me to return the phone, making me think the camera itself was bad. Plan on using an alternate camera app. I switched to Camera MX for photos. (Available on Amazon, but newer versions on Google Play) Camera MX has a conflict with video on this phone though and simply doesn't work. The stock camera app works okay for video.❖ The battery is not replaceable. They do wear out after a while and I like to keep phones for years and repurpose them for other things after their service life as a phone expires. (As controllers for things, MP3 jukeboxes, etc) I like being able to go on Amazon, spend $20 on a replacement battery and quickly switch it out. Additionally, even if you don't keep your phones that long, batteries fail sometimes. So no replaceable battery is a problem for me. This might not be an issue for you. If not, great! But be aware of the issue before making purchase decisions. I sucked it up on this one because it's my wife's phone and she didn't care. But I don't love this industry trend.░░░░░THE BOTTOM LINE░░░░░❖ It EASILY outperforms it's $180 purchase price. It's not the greatest Smartphone of all time, but you cannot beat this phone for $180. I said the same thing about the 5.5"" version's $250 price. The 4.7"" isn't as good of a phone overall as the 5.5"" which has more physical room in the housing to cram in better specs, but for $180 the 4.7"" version is a great value, even with the camera not being an industry leader.❖ Ultimately you have to decide what features are important to you. If you never use the camera or don't use it for anything you want to keep, like maybe you just take pictures of your parking space so you remember where you parked, it's a great smartphone. I love the form factor of it. It's thinness. It's weight. It's display. It's all very nice.❖ Use an alternate camera app that gives you more control over the exposure. An alternate camera app changed my decision to return this phone. I had this as a 4 star review until I had better luck with different apps. I also compared the quality of the photos to the price tag of the phone and realized that it's a great value. You can get a better camera on a phone, but it will cost more to do it. For $180 you really can't go wrong."
"Alcatel",5,"The phone came without issues. Have a great display and the processor responds well. Visually have a great look. For the price is a very good acquisition."
"Alcatel",3,"This phone is marred by unacceptable Bluetooth performance. It literally drops my Bluetooth headset when I put it in my pants pocket! On the plus side, the sound and speaker phone functionality is quite good, as other reviewers have mentioned. It also is not an exceptionally rugged phone as the screen broke after a fall from less than 3 feet."
"Alcatel",5,"Phone was purchased for my son. He's loving the phone so far and has been using it for a couple of months now. Takes pretty good pictures. Phone is snappy even only having 1.5gb of ram. Doesn't crash when he uses Snapchat which he's very happy about!!! His prior phone would crash on some apps. I'd highly recommend this phone for anybody on a budget & wanting a decent mid-range phone. Also, for anybody wondering this device did receive the Android M (Marshmallow) update."
"Alcatel",5,"Very happy with this phone. My last one was also an Alcatel but only 4 gig, not near enough for all the popular software and photographs. 16 gig seems really good for my needs. Would buy again!"
"Alcatel",2,"The call quality is terrible, something between fade and tin can. Camera is ok, but image quality well below my previous phones, a Moto G and an LG. Most frustrating of all, after a month, the first time I dropped the phone the screen shattered and that was with an outer casing accessory. The only redeeming quality was the compact size."
"Alcatel",4,"On point and fair at $149. I love this little phone!"
"Alcatel",5,"Great phone"
"Alcatel",4,"Great phone and much more dependable than other phones in its price range. Great pics and easy to use. The only con is battery life. If you use location services and bluetooth then you must charge everyday. Other than that I love the phone."
"Alcatel",5,"The phone came in its original box with a security seal, not only did it come with a good charger(the one that you can plug into a computer or wall) but it also came with JBL headphones.Also, product came in 2 days.I cant believe I got all this with such good quality for such a good price.Definitely a good buy."
"Alcatel",4,"Pretty solid battery life. Fast. BIG sound. Just wish the camera had a little more zoom and the screen is only about 4in max. But the camera is quite clear and good hd screen"
"Alcatel",5,"Great phone ....great price. Works seamlessly on T-Mobile."
"Alcatel",4,"I really like the size and weight of this phone. A friend has a Samsung Galaxy S6 and we both think it's too bulky. Personal preference...It's nice to have a micro SD to load up with photos and music. Music player is fun to mess with. If I could change one thing it would be dual SIM.Works great with US-Mobile. No complaints."
"Alcatel",4,"strongly recommend it."
"Alcatel",4,"very good"
"Alcatel",3,"Sometime get hot and battery running out quick"
"Alcatel",2,"This phone is for music lovers right? Speakers are good but my Bluetooth is horrible I put the phone in my pocket and simply turn around and my Bluetooth speaker will cut out don't have that problem with other phones anyone else have this problem? Did drop the phone once before I activated it though. Hitting the power and volume down at the same time will do a screenshot which seems almost unavoidable and it happens all the time and is really getting on my nerves hell my home screen freaked out or so I thought until I realized I was looking at a s***load of screenshots can't find an option the disable this feature yet. The cameras focus is horrible compared to my old Moto E and my Samsung Avant. Something about unlocking the screen and about the way the notifications work has really been annoying. I going to fix my old samsung Avant a throw this one in the trash if I can't find an easy fix for most of these issues"
"Alcatel",5,"Got it as a gift for my dad in India, replaced his Micromax phone. Dad is super delighted. Superb performance, very good photography, long battery life, super slim. Android is not overly skinned but practical and lightweight.BTW, the next generation of this phone (Idol 4) is the Blackberry Android phone. Strong cred there!"
"Alcatel",3,"The Alcatel Idol 3 compact (4.7) is a decent phone.The good:Nice form. Slim, and easily held in one hand.Good performance (connectivity, tasks, etc....)Great stereo sound with the built in speakers. As a music listening device it's terrific.The bad:Unfortunately as a phone it's really not great.Could only faintly hear the other person in my apartment (even with the volume maxed), and on a noisy NYC street it was nearly impossible.The battery life is terrible. I suspect I might've gotten a dud, because with very light use (listening to music and checking emails a couple of times), the phone barely lasted a little more than half a day.Overall, the low volume and bad battery life made me return it quickly. Too bad, as everything else is very nice."
"Alcatel",5,"Thin, sharp, stereo, best for the price! Smart move."
"Alcatel",5,"It works great for my niece"
"Alcatel",5,"Perfect cell phone"
"Alcatel",5,"Very good"
"Alcatel",5,"Iv'e had the phone for around a week now and just love it. From the form factor to the amazing front firing speakers to the intuitive stock android lollipop interface. I am using it on cricket wireless and everything just worked right away once i popped my sim card in. Wifi and LTE reception are on par or possibly superior to the LG G2 i replaced. Battery life on standby isnt quite as good as my G2, but while actually using the phone (watching videos especially) it mops the floor of the G2 in terms on on screen time. This is due to the lower res (but still very nice) screen and lower power snapdragon 410 CPU. Dont let the lower power fool you, ive yet to run into any scenario the phone hasnt performed just as well as my G2, which on paper is twice as fast. Just a heads up to buyers of the 5.5"" model (too big for my tastes, but seems to be the preferred size nowadays) is that it is coming to cricket wireless nov 6th for 149.00 bucks, 100 bucks off retail. Mind you it wont be unlocked, this would just be for people using cricket, and as a cricket customer i have only good things to say about them (they use ATT towers, they are the best MNVO by miles).The only con i can come up with on the phone is that it does not beep at you when fully charged, but the LED light goes off after its been at 100% for a couple minutes. I remedied this with an app called Gsam for the app store, now my phone beeps when it hits 100% :)In my opinion this blows away the competition (looking at you moto g) for the money, 16gb storage and 1.5gb memory really put it head and shoulders above other phones in this price range. Not to mention the better screen, absurdly loud speakers and overall dainty form factor (for a phone in 2015).Trust me, you will not regret this purchase, especially if you are looking for a phone under the ""norm"" 5""+ form factor."
"Alcatel",5,"Great product! I'm loving the smaller phone. It's a breath of fresh air from all these phablets and near phablets. I guess I'm in a minority for wanting a smaller phone. Battery life is great and performance is really good. I can't see any lags navigating through menus. I don't play games on my phone so I'm not sure how good the graphics processor. It has outstanding standby time. The screen is great even under sun light. The phone is very light and it produces incredible sound from its dual stereo front facing speakers. The screen is very crisp despite not being 1080P (not a knock, anything below 5"" screen doesn't need a 1080P screen). I've had the 5.5"" version but found it a bit too big for my taste. This phone is perfect, it's even a tad bit smaller than an iPhone 6/6S. 16GB is fine paired up with my 64GB Sandisk memory card. I didn't even think about the Moto G 2015 because with 16GB it's already close to the Idol 3 5.5"" ~$250 price. I'm not so worried about updates. As long as there are security patches and the apps work, then it's fine."
"Alcatel",5,"Excellent! Many thanks."
"Alcatel",5,"Great product"
"Alcatel",5,"Nice it was allá that im expected"
"Alcatel",5,"I was originally looking for a Samsung phone, but I wanted the latest version of Android in a phone that would fit in my pocket. The Idol 3 was just what I needed. Pictures are great for a phone, the OS runs smoothly, battery life is good - gets me through the day easily on a full charge, and it's a great size. The only irritating thing is answering the ""what kind of phone is that?"" question then watching the confused looks because they've never heard of Alcatel. I'm certainly glad to have skipped the ""big names""."
"Alcatel",5,"The phone looks nice and works smoothly. Definitely worth the price. The cameras, both front and back, take crisp clear pictures. Very happy with the product."
"Alcatel",5,"Excelent phone for the price"
"Alcatel",5,"So far so good! I have had it for a few months now have not had one problem. Speakers are really great"
"Alcatel",5,"Update 3/07/16:I have moved my rating from a 4 to 5.The TracFone AT&T 4G LTE sim works great at Bodega Bay. So we have good connections in what has been a blackout area for years.I upgraded my text system to the MySms premium for better texting and easier texting pictures to family and friends.I added Camera MX for better picture taking and ease of transmitting pictures with the MySms as noted above. The system works seamlessly with Amazon Prime Photos. Take a picture. In a short time it is on Amazon Prime, and I can text the photos to our friends and family in seconds. I have just scratched the surface with the capabilities of Camera MX, and it surpasses any phone camera or camera I have had in over a decade.The battery continues to be amazing and also eliminates the drain on my Android tablet / Chromebook with the MySyms connection.So this great phone fits in my pockets is powerful and does anything I need or want with the phone, internet connection and camera +4G LTE!The cost of this is about $200.The first part of the below is for Tracfone customers/users. If you don’t use Tracfone, go below the dotted line for my review.For a week, my new Alcatel Idol 3, 4.7 didn’t work with my transferred Tracfone minutes and years of use. The Tracfone site showed that my BYOP transfer had worked with my new BYOP sim card, and all of my minutes, data and time left were transferred. The phone didn’t work to make/receive calls or texts.Alcatel was of no help. A friend suggested that I email Tracfone to set up a phone call with them. I did and got online, with someone as per the email from them. He claimed they didn’t have any of my data. Including tracfone phone # and id #’s. Fortunately, I had made a hard copy of what I had re time and years on my old smartphone and what Tracfone showed with my new Sim cardI told him that I needed to speak with someone, who could help me. Then on hold for 15 minutes, when a nice woman answered and again wanted all the data I had emailed and told the other phone person. After, I re told her the specific data, reading from my hard copy made the day the BYOP was supposedly activated. Then, she said I didn’t have anytime left on my contract, and I need to buy more time. I reminded her of the hard data showing over 2000 minutes and time of agreement for years to come. That was a 30 minute + call process.She said that she had to transfer me to another supervisor. She did, and the new person started asking for my data given twice that call. I said that I had sent all of that in via email, and I had given that data twice on the same phone call. She found my contract and said my phone wasn’t 4.7 working because my time/minutes/data hadn’t been transferred. She did her thing on her end and my phone fired up and I dialed in the code to activate it.It now works with well over one hour on the phone going over same stuff 3 times with Tracfone on line people------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Evaluation of this phone is now 5 stars.Before, I got my Tracfone problem corrected, I had used my new phone via wifi to transfer the contacts, pictures and apps from my old android LG phone. Most of this went well. The transfer of stuff from a nearby or close Android (Acer tablet, old Android phone and my Acer Chromebook 15, which I’m using for this report), didn’t work.The wifi reception is good but not as strong as my wife’s Alcatel One Touch Android. Where I use it at home, the wifi reception is strong and very fast.The 4.7” screen fits in my shirt pockets even after the bottom half of the add on hard case was added.The screen size is adequate for what I want to do away from home, to make/receive phone calls and text/receive and check texts and emails. I will use my Acer 8 tablet or my Chromebook for more involved keyboard/screen work at home.The battery, so far is adequate so far for my uses. Last night it was @ ¾ charge, and I didn’t charge it. This morning it was still @ ¾ charged and again at 2 pm this afternoon. When, I picked it up again and turned it on it was still at 3/4.Bloatware is at a minimum.It accepted my 64 gig card with no fuss.The Android 5.0 seems to be smoother and less drag than our previous 4.?.It works smoothly with MY SMS which I have on my tablet and Chromebook.Also, when you receive a phone call, you don’t push or make contact directly with the phone Icon. You have slide that Icon to the right to answer. I have had cell phones since the 1990’s, and that is different.Since the phone is now working with Tracfone, I have to push the app buttons on the screen harder than before.The glass add on screen I bought is too big. The standard screen gets very messy very quickly with minimal useage. I will try to find an aftermarket glass that fits.The combo hard case and belt case (extra buy) is a mixed picture. The hard case fits fairly well;however if you attach that to the other half of the hard case, you can’t really get the camera out to make phone calls, receive them or to take a picture. You have to remove the part that covers the phone and the back part of the case. I missed two phone calls from my wife due to this time delay to get to the front of the phone. Also, I didn’t get a picture of some on the move wildlife in our area due to this problemIf you use Tracfone BYOP, and your phone doesn’t work. Don’t waste your time contacting Alcatel. Send Tracfone an email with your data and tell them your phone isn’t working. Tracfone will send you an email with a phone# and a numeric code to use. When you, make that call, sit in a comfortable chair and have a hardline phone available, all of your data available, a bottle of water, a lot of patience, and your well charged Alcatel Idol 3. I used my Acer Chromebook to help with the data, the “lost” data and other stuff they needed.In this short time, I think that Alcatel and Tracfone have a good winning combo. If you use Tracfone’s BYOP, and you are an established customer wanting to transfer your minutes and time, be sure to make hard copies of your minutes and data. You will probably need that data.-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Update re the battery. It is an excellent battery with heavy use. It is the best cell phone battery, we have ever owned re standby. It holds the charge in standby versus our other androids phones and tablets using the battery charge overnight or just standing unplugged.Re wifi connections. It quickly recognizes our home wifi and connects and other hot spots seamlessly. Its wifi range in our house isn't as good as my wife's Alcatel One Touch Popup, which is incredible re its wifi range. However, since I never use these phones in our bedroom and a few other weak wifi areas, that is not an issue. The auto switch from wifi to Tracfone 4G LTE like going from our family room to our back yard is auto and seamless. So far the Tracfone/AT&T 4G LTE in our area is very strong and reliable. Hopeoufully, we can try the AT&T 4G LTE in/on our coastal areas where our Verizon/Trackfone coverage is zero.The Android 5.? seems to be more reliable and easier to do simple things with versus the Android 4.?'s."
"Alcatel",5,"Great specs on an inexpensive phone. Works well. Not waterproof as my wife found out with her first one....but good enough to buy again."
"Alcatel",1,"The Internet is so slow on this phone. Can only work good while connected to the wifi."
"Alcatel",4,"This is a good phone. I would have liked a instruction book with it. I did download one off the internet. But I need to study it. There are still features which I have to figure out. On the whole I really like this phone. One feature I either have not figured out, it's not working right, or it is the way it is made. Is the sound of it dialing, when I call someone is not very loud. And I have not found a way to make the dial tone louder. I have some trouble with hearing, but my husband, being definitely hard of hearing may not be able to hear it, or want to use it."
"Alcatel",5,"I brought this phone for my son for Christmas and he loves it. We are with T-Mobile. He switched his SIM card from his old phone to this phone and hasn't had any problems at all."
"Alcatel",5,"Very good model, love Alcatel One Touch !!! very good supplier also!! I received it quickly!! GREAT !!"
"Alcatel",5,"Excellent phone. Great headphones!"
"Alcatel",2,"I would not recommend this phone for people who need simple functionality or good Bluetooth capabilities. I came from having a moto g, and I think you really do get what you pay for. After 3 months with this phone, I am counting it as a loss and going back to Motorola. It takes 3x longer to do anything you need to do on this phone. The keyboard is not responsive and poorly calibrated, the speakers aren't great, and there are no compatible apps that compare to Motorola assist. Making phone calls takes about three extra steps, and I rarely am able to make or receive calls due to poor reception. I would blame that on the phone service company, but my boyfriend and I are on a family plan and he gets reception when I don't. The text message app is horrible, I downloaded a new one to make it usuable. This phone would be a good starter phone for a teenager, but that's about it. The speakers are bad enough that I have to use speaker phone to make calls (I'm 25)"
"Alcatel",5,"Good phone for the price, a nice screen with a nice sound, and a fluid interface."
"Alcatel",5,"Good solid phone at a very low price for all it offers. Stable and fast, definetly worth the shot."
"Alcatel",1,"I bought 2 UNITS OF THIS CELL PHONE, HO HAVE DEPRECIATION OF $ 20 EACH, I feel ripped off, RETURN MY MONEY, NOT SEE POSSIBLE IN PROMOTION THIS SAME IN $ 169 NOW $ 149 PAGE MORE FOR THE SAME PHONE LESS ONE WEEK, RETURNING THIS DIFFERENCE IN A BONO GIFTCARD"
"Alcatel",4,"Have only owned it for about a week. Battery saver is excellent for me but if you're walking around with the phone in your pocket, it will detect motion and may not sleep as you might expect. Mine sits on a table much of the day and so it sleeps soundly. :-) Speakers are nice JBL but bass response is still lacking which is inherent in the extremely thin design of this phone. You may need to install an equalizer to reduce mid and high frequencies for a richer sound. I would have given 5 stars except that there is a small ""sweet spot"" when listening on a phone call. If the phone is not placed just so on the ear, the volume is reduced significantly. I think it just takes some practice. The dual speakers and dual microphones work beautifully for quickly answering phone upside down if necessary. FM radio will not run unless earphones are plugged in as they act as an antenna. Display is perfect for me. Some built in wallpapers look pixelated but they're probably just crappy samples. As you'll see with Android 5, you cannot have a different wallpaper on your lock screen. So much for using it as a quick flashlight like I did with my old phone.Android 5 does come with a flashlight hidden in the SECOND pull-down notification menu with the Bluetooth and WiFi buttons. The flashlight is not an ""app"". Note: WiFi does NOT turn on using the ""WiFi Display"" app. You must use either the settings menu or the second pull down menu to do that. This phone has an auto-dimming screen which also automatically brightens to max when in sunlight. VERY nice feature but you may find that a nearby light source in a dark room could fool the sensor and make it dimmer than you want it. Just adjust the angle of the screen so that the sensor detects the light and the screen will brighten accordingly. You can also turn this feature off.This is not a ""department store"" brand. They are sold at T-Mobile stores and I was told by a clerk that the Idol 3 is really nice and they don't have it to sell because they were sent a lesser version by corporate.Almost forgot to mention the most important thing; This phone is an upgrade from my 3 year old Samsung which was loading pages agonizingly slow. This Alcatel with Android 5 and LTE loads pages almost instantly! AND this phone is eligible for the Android 6 Marshmallow upgrade as soon as it is available. No luck yet trying to upgrade but I love it! Marshmallow will allow you to override permissions for each app. Other than that, not much change.If you sign up for an Amazon Signature card like I did, you can get an extra $50. off this phone. BEWARE: Amazon automatically changes your default payment method to the new card! If you don't want that, go to your settings and change it back to your old card. Also, the phone must be purchased with the Amazon card to get the discount. So remember to pay off the card right away if you don't want interest charged. You have 21 days grace period. I've had this card before. Keep an eye on your default payment before you check out because it was changed on me once before without my knowledge before making a purchase. One-click ordering is what caused it to happen to me as it does not give you an opportunity to see your default payment method."
"Alcatel",3,"at first 4 days, phone feels solid but will not recognized new external 16GB extermal micro SD card. i tried reboot, formating card, and re-installing SD Card but nothing. when i go to settings, storage..it says mount SD card, when i click ....nothing. frustrating as this is why i dumped my old LG optimus F6."
"Alcatel",1,"i just bought 2, 4.7 inch versions one for me and one for my wife, for some reason with both phones when i take a video there is no sound on playback. i even tried uploading it to my google photos app but still no sound on any video taken!!! PLEASE how can i fix this? already tried rebooting, factory reset, erasing cache and raising all volumes on sounds and messaging."
"Alcatel",5,"Bought this phone to replace my wife's phone which is several years old and needed replacing. The phone came boxed with the charger, cord, headphones and instructions. There were English instructions that were well written and easy to follow. It took us about 30 minutes to set up the phone for here and move everything thing over. It has working flawlessly since we got it and she is very pleased with it. It is not going to compete with some of very high end phones but it does have a quad core processor and plenty of speed for what she does. For the price, this is one of the nicest phones that I have seen"
"Alcatel",5,"excellent goods for me"
"Alcatel",4,"good"
"Alcatel",5,"Hello bought this phone in Sept 2015 now April 2nd the phone is dead, battery probably . So pretty upset I've had phone for 5 1/2 months. Its covered under the 1 year warranty. I will be calling Alcatel Modnay not happy about being without a phone for 3 weeks as i hear on the net. I lliked this phone on every category, voice calls, text, camera good, fast etc but ignored that you can't replace the battery. I'll let you know what happens with manufacturer. Called Alcatel customer service on battery all good 1-855-368-0829"
"Alcatel",5,"Awesome no frills unlocked phone. Works great on T-Mobile and gets all the bands so coverage is excellent compared to my old unlocked ATT phone."
"Alcatel",4,"This is a very nice phone and I am almost 100% pleased with it, especially the battery life. It outshines my old iPhone 4s battery life by miles.First the cons: I do not like that the wake up/power button is directly opposite of the volume bar switch. The iPhone wake button is much better placed. I also do not like that you have to bring up settings and then ringtones and then scroll to None click on it and then click OK to turn off the ringer and use only vibrate, here again the iPhone has it beat hands down with the little switch on the side.Now the Pros: The screen is really nice and much easier to keep clean that the iPhone, the operating system has IPhone beat hands down, the speaker system is really much more that I expected from a device this small and, to top it off you can answer it from either end with the reversible microphone. The battery life is really great compared to my old iPhone4s. Over all this phone rates about a solid 95%.I am using it on Wal-Mart's family plan which is serviced by T-Mobile and the signal is not quite as good as Verizon was with my old iPhone but it the service is acceptable for what I use it for. I do feel tho it would be stronger on AT&T snd I may at some point switch to them but for now it is serving my purposes well."
"Alcatel",4,"I've had ZTE AWE, LG G2, iPhone 5s, Idol 3 5.5"" and now Idol 3 4.7"".This phone is slim, light, and perfect size for the pocket and web browsing. The Idol 5.5"" was too large to keep comfortably in my pocket without breaking it.The screen has a yellower white, which I like better for reading. The screen of the Idol 5.5"" had a bright bluish white, which often hurt my eyes. Both screens are very reflective - remedied by a MATTE screen protector by Mr. Shield.The battery is 2000 mAh, which to my surprise is sufficient to stream Pandora on 4G the whole day. I always thought that I needed 3000 mAh for a whole day operation but the new version of Android is surprisingly battery efficient.The sound from the phone speakers is loud and clear with some depth, but definitely not with super bass or ""like from big speakers"", as some reviews are claiming. Strangely, the ringing and notifications are decreased in volume when headphones are plugged in - definitely a software bug that Alcatel has to straighten out.While the sound through the on-board speakers is good, JBL did an exceptionally poor job with the sound enhancement through headphones, for which I am removing one star. Most cheap earbuds (less than $20) that I tried with the Idol 3 sounded with weak bass. Turning on the JBL ""audio effects"" attempts to create surround sound by distancing/depressing the mid frequencies, corresponding to human voices. That results in decreased clarity and ""muddy"" sound. The included JBL earphones were the worst from the bunch I tried with no clear highs and a complete lack of bass. I would not pay even $5 for those. Only the earbuds that came with my iPhone 5s had crystal clarity and after I pumped the bass with the Bass Booster app, the sound became acceptable and listening to Pandora enjoyable.A pleasant surprise was the back (13 Mpx) f/2.0 aperture camera, which is the same in the 4.7"" and the 5.5"" models. Its Automatic mode takes good pics in good light. The Automatic is not smart enough in low light so I turn on the Manual mode, set timer to 5s to avoid camera shake, and ISO to about 800. With these manual settings, I was able to get sharp selfies (can see my skin pores) without much noise even in very dim light (indoors, early in the morning on a cloudy day). In comparison, the iPhone 5s automatic mode rarely produced sharp pics in dim light (like indoors during the day), while LG G2 got them but smeared all fine details like eyelashes and skin pores due to agressive noise reduction. The pics that I get with the Idol 3 come out with colors close to what my eyes see with slight saturation of reds. In comparison, LG G2 had a tendency to produce washed out (bluer) pics.In terms of everyday tasks, the 4.7"" Idol 3 is just as fast as the 5.5"" version, and is even faster in the animation when you close all open apps and they slide off the screen one by one. The 5.5"" version stutters in that ?! The 4.7"" Idol 3 has slower processor on specs but has to control fewer screen pixels or is better optimized. I rarely play games on phones so can't compare the two phones in that department. Both phones stutter when browsing the DESKTOP version of image-intensive web pages like Amazon but even my powerful desktop computer does that. It has more to do with downloading all the images and the site programming than with how fast the phone video processor is. The occasional slight stutter does not defray from pleasant web browsing."
"Alcatel",4,"Great phone for the price. No issues. Works great. Fast as I need it to be."
"Alcatel",5,"Awesome phone. Light on apps, upgraded to newest Android, and is fast with apps, tethering, and everything in between. One of the best unlocked phones out there. Also, audio quality and included JBL earbuds sound great, and the camera and flexibility of this phone is amazing. Would recommend and buy again."
"Alcatel",5,"Amazing phone, fast, great for foreign travel as I inserted a China Mobil sim and it works perfectly!This phone beats the apple Iphone hands down and also still works with my Alcatel Smart Watch as well perfectly.I have nothing but delight using this phone and I am totally in love with it!I can not imagine anything better with a smart phone.Everything it does is simple, quick, and very fast.The memory is enough for any project I may ever need.RC"
"Alcatel",5,"Love it!"
"Alcatel",4,"Unlocked phones were never this good before. As a phone it works great. The camera is good in daylight, not so good in dark settings, but for the price that's fair. The screen itself looks very good, way better than the run of the mill budget phones. The speakers are fantastic. Alcatel has a partnership with JBL and you get a very decent set of JBL earbuds included. The most obvious con to me is the speed, which is just OK. This is why I docked a star, although for the price this is as much as you can expect.This phone runs a close to pure version of android 5.02. When you first power on the phone, it prompts you to download a software update that takes care of the stagefright vulnerability.If you are on T-Mobile, this phone has band 12.Although the phone lets you uninstall some apps, one app that can't be uninstalled and can't be disabled is the music player. I like to use another music player app and I have to be careful that I don't turn the factory one on by mistake, or else I'll have 2 different songs playing at the same time.I've noticed that if I'm holding the phone upside down (ie, if I'm reading lying down) when I click the screen, it might not take. But if I'm just holding the phone in my hand with the screen facing up (which is the normal way) then it works every time.All in all, I have only minor nits to pick and I think this to be an all around solid phone. Even if you don't buy this phone, don't automatically buy a phone from a carrier....shop around and you can find more for your money."
"Alcatel",5,"excellent product, received in perfect condition and the phone is very good, very sophisticated and very responsive. Its main feature is that the sound is very good and meets the expectation of a person who is not so demanding, and the owner of the publication are very responsible recommend them."
"Alcatel",3,"I gave it 3 stars instead of 2 because of the price. It has numerous smaller bugs (I assume in the firmware). The most recent and most annoying one is where at random times it starts playing music (seriously). Its not the music app, because I checked it, it wasn't playing anything, then I closed it and all other open apps and the music continued. It must have been streaming since I didn't have that music, yet it was a completely different genre from the last playlist I streamed. Often when I unlock my phone and start doing stuff the music stops, but not always.Still an OK phone if you have no money. I'm hoping this is an isolated incident and will try to replace my phone."
"Alcatel",5,"Very nice phone, love it!"
"Alcatel",3,"Received firmware updates since I bought it, making it much MUCH better than when it first arrived, IMO. But the weird thing is sometimes I pull it out of my pocket and it's jus a black screen. No matter how many times I hit the power button it won't wake up or turn on - I have to hold the power button for 10 seconds to reset it. This has happened through multiple firmware versions. Also, the auto-brightness has a tendency to stay bright and melt my eyes at night.The screen quality is nice, but over time I'm starting to be able to see something behind the screen - not sure if they're individual LEDs or if they're related to the digitizer / touch sensor or what, they look like small rings (although I will admit this phone has already taken a beating and I don't protect it with a case since it was an inexpensive device).Overall, though, the speed and responsiveness are nice. It's not the best device I've ever owned, but for the price I paid, I'm not too unhappy The speakers are fairly impressive, and they can get nice and loud on their own. In the end, it's VERY light and thin and that is impressive, but there are probably more impressive phones available for less money if you want something that was a flagship a few years ago. The downside to those is, you might not end up with Marshmallow, like this phone has been upgraded to.6.0.1. If you leave it at the stock 5.x that it came with, you're probably going to be very disappointed in this phone - I know I wasn't impressed with it at all until the firmware update arrived."
"Alcatel",5,"A great phone for the price. There are a few bugs, but minor ones and I think every phone has those. The camera is powerful, the interface is smooth and offers some cool and unusual features, and it's just the right size. I'd recommend it."
"Alcatel",5,"I love this phone! Great camera, great storage, great screen, great speakers. The only thing is, it has trouble getting service. A lot of dead zones with this phone, my boyfriend has the same service provider and usually has a signal while I don't."
"Alcatel",1,"stop working after 5 months, garbage!"
"Alcatel",5,"great phone sister loves it"
"Alcatel",5,"Love this phone"
"Alcatel",2,"It slipped off my lap while I was sitting in a chair, falling 1.5 feet to the ground and the screen exploded. Yeah it's my fault because I ""dropped"" it. But how many phones have I had in my life that i've dropped from much higher distances, and that has never happened.:("
"Alcatel",1,"this is a piece of crap purchased it in May can't return it and now is won't work now I have a $150.00 paperweight"
"Alcatel",5,"Good phone"
"Alcatel",5,"The phone is very nice. I bought it for the stereo speakers built-in and they don't disappoint. The speakers are loud. The screen is clear and can show good videos. The size is just right in my hand. The inverting screen is a great feature to use."
"Alcatel",5,"We bought two of these phones (at full price, so this is an actual customer review, not one that may be biased by having received it for free or at a discount) a few months ago and still really love them. We spent quite a bit of time researching all of the options available both above and below this price range, and this phone looked to be a great value, and it really is. We are very pleased with our purchase. We use it with T-Mobile on one of their pre-paid plans and have had a very good experience with the phone and T-Mobile. We are also going to be traveling outside the country, and this phone comes unlocked and supports all of the bands that we need.Pros: The screen looks great, and is very bright and crisp. The camera takes very nice pictures and video. The phone fits nicely in the hand and looks and feels like a much more expensive phone. The build quality is excellent. We charge them after a couple days of normal use, so the battery seems to last a respectable amount of time. The sound, as other reviewers have mentioned, is just excellent. This thing can really put out some sound, and gone are the days of not being able to hear your phone ring! Playing music on it sounds great, and is stereo (one speaker at each end of the phone). The phone is reversible, with a microphone and speaker at each end, so it doesn't matter which way its facing when you pick it up to answer it, the phone will just take care of it based on the orientation using the gyro sensor. This isn't really a must have feature, but it is kind of nice. It plays videos (such as YouTube) very well, and it feels very smooth and responsive in every app we've tried. The value for the money is great, and we would still be very happy with it if we paid more.Cons:Wish it supported dual sim cards instead of just one, but you get a microSD card spot instead, so not too bad and most people probably only need one sim card slot anyway.Wish the volume could be adjusted in smaller increments, but this isn't the phone's fault, it's an android thing and not a deal breaker at all.In closing, we are very pleased with our purchase of two of these phones and would quickly and happily buy them again. If you are looking for a great unlocked GSM phone and don't want to pay an arm and a leg, then give this one a try. We highly recommend it!"
"Alcatel",4,"Very nice phone. It is a simple phone but it work good. Maybe the camera not perfect but for the price it is a worthy phone.I am from the caribbean and the phone work ok. It is indeed unlocked."
"Alcatel",5,"Excelent!"
"Alcatel",1,"WORST PHONE I EVER HAD! EVER! WORST! TERRIBLE! DONT BUY! Holds battery for less than a day..."
"Alcatel",5,"Speakers are so clear. Don't find reversible feature useful. Needed 16gb ROM and this fit the criteria."
"Alcatel",5,"This seems to be a great little phone.When I saw it would cost $700 to get a new Samsung to replace my old S3, I shopped around. I bought the Alcatel Idol 3 (4.7"") from Amazon and after a week am pretty much thrilled at how well it works.The setup had some bumps for me because my cloud files were not up to date. My advice here is to update your contacts, files (including downloads), and pictures before cluttering the new phone with junk So don't log in to your Google acount (yes, even just for email) until stuff is updated and synch'ed up on the old phone.Also, perhaps because the Alcatel phone is ""unlocked"" and is not a service provider's proprietary device, it does not wake up in your hand knowing how to handle internet data. When you enter an in-range WiFi password, the Internet will work fine. To get it to work when you do NOT have WiFi, you will need to setup the mobile networks. This might be as easy as selecting your; provider in settings:(wireless networks - more - mobile networks - access point names - and then either select yourprovider.) You might need to enter the info manually if your provider is not listed. I found listings online by searching for ""AT&T Alcatel APN settings"" but didn't need it because my carrier is AT&T and there was a preconfigured choice as I described earlier.The ""unlocked"" feature is great because it means the phone works with SIM chips from any provider. So if I switch from AT&T to Verizon, Sprint, or any other service provider, this phone will work instantly as soon as I insert the chip. Also, if I travel to a foreign country -- in addition to being able to function on multiple networks --, I will be able to buy a chip for any country and put it into my own phone. If you have travelled, you know what I am talking about. Using your own phone is wonderful in foreign countries.NOTE: My phone accepted a memory chip in addition to the SIM; I see you CAN get a dual SIM option; which I do not understand. The little chip carrier can removed by pushing a paper clip into the tiny hole on the left side of the phone. The little tray slides all the way out. The chips do not fit snugly, but must be sort of balanced or set carefully and then inserted gently. I was actually surprised when it worked because the whole process seemed to require more faith than skill. The phone is so small and compact, it is easy to forgive this space saving compromise.I haven't compared the camera, but it seems fine. I got accustomed to popping the back off my Samsung and just dropping in a newly charged battery, but the Alcatel is sealed. I guess if the battery dies I will need to send it in for service or just replace the whole thing.In general, I think there are enough good reasons to give this phone a try and it is a low risk. Alcatel also makes a 5.5"" phone, so if you want a bigger unit, it's an option.I know this sounds almost evangelical, but I do pay attention to details. Seems like a winner to me."
"Alcatel",5,"Love it. Definitely worth the great price. I have owed mine for over six months and love it. Second Alcatel phone I have owed only bought new one because I was ready to upgrade. Love these phones. price is wonderful."
"Alcatel",5,"Wow this phone I recomend!!! Excellent"
"Alcatel",4,"Nice phone"
"Alcatel",5,"Perfect unlocked Android phone. Very light weight and very slim. Phone has worked flawlessly on AT&T prepaid with 4G LTE coverage where available."
"Alcatel",1,"Never again will I trust all the positive reviews of an Alcatel phone - lasted two days before problems started. Battery draining within 2 hours of unplugging the phone without even using the phone or installing any apps. Just had email set for push notifications and wifi and gps on like I have used all my other phones. the next problem was the phone switching between earpiece and speaker phone multiple times during a phone call. Returned phone and will try the new moto g."
"Alcatel",4,"As the title says this is a great little phone, there was a time when I could not see myself using a phone under 5 inches but the Idol 3 4.7 inch is incredible. This is coming from someone who was using one of the largest phablets around in the Sony Xperia Z Ultra.It offers a nice compact clean design asthetic, great dual front facing speakers and a lil touch of customization (mainly icons and a few apps) on top of stock Android 5.0.2 as of writing this review.The processing package had me concerned at first but once you actually use the device and tailor it your liking, you realize how snappy and responsive it really is. My only complaint is that Alcatel didn't go all out and create enough accessories for this phone, it's kinda difficult to find a decent case for it but I enjoy the design language so much that I'm willing to just go 'naked' with this one.In conclusion, I'm very happy with my purchase and may consider buying the 5.5 inch sibling down the road."
"Alcatel",5,"I personally love this phone . As someone who has had many many phone (roughly 5-6 a year) I know what I like. I'm sick of the huge screens so this footprint is perfect for me. This by no means is a flag ship device and shouldn't be treated as such , but it has a very crisp screen , a good camera , wonderful front facing speakers and is was $180 bucks and on prime I got 1 day free shipping. I have the 2gb moto g model and I will be leaving my collection because of this phone. If you not a power user this phone is great , it does everything you want it too and I've averaged about 5.5 hours of SOT on wifi. So buy with confidence."
"Alcatel",5,"Excellent budget android phone. I have been unhappy with my previous phone for some time. I felt like finding the right phone at a decent price was impossible. I wanted 4g LTE, unlocked gsm, 16gb internal with an expandable storage SD slot, and it needed to be 4.7"" or less to comfortably fit in my hands and my wallet. I found a few compact phones that would work, but they would cost upwords of $200 used. This phone fit the criteria. I know decreasing its size downgraded some of the specs from the 5.5"" version, but I am a simple smartphone user and don't need a top of the line phone. This phone is lighter and has better specs than my old phone, so I am happy!"
"Alcatel",4,"[EDIT]I've completely altered my original review, as my unit no longer has many of the problems I originally encountered, and a call-drop problem was actually being caused by the way the phone was handling the Skype app. I still have the light-bleed issue, which is the only reason I'm dropping a star. Otherwise, it's been a pretty good phone. One other potential issue is that the phone doesn't really integrate very well with expandable memory, but this is hardly an Android issue exclusive to the OneTouch."
"Alcatel",5,"I am very happy that I purchased this phone. I switched from a Samsung Galaxy Note 2 because it was outdated and just too big! I was sick of it. So I went out to T-Mobile to upgrade to a new phone but I couldn't find one that was significantly smaller than the Note 2 (5.7"" screen). They just do not make normal sized phones anymore. That is where the Alcatel OneTouch Idol 3 4.7"" comes into play. It is the PERFECT SIZE. The only thing big about this phone is the name! Good specs for somebody who just needs a phone for normal use. Yes, it is not the fastest phone out there but for the money, you CAN'T beat it! To be honest, it is very snappy to me and the screen quality is great. Not to mention, the 13MP camera is extremely fast and takes good quality pics.I highly recommend this phone!Also note, in my experience, the Amazon free shipping was extremely slow! I would upgrade to the next available shipping method if you want your phone in less than a week."
"Alcatel",2,"I purchased the 4.7 version after having the 5.5 for 2wks. I wanted to see if the smaller version would be the larger version in smaller packaging. I was a bit disappointed because battery life is my most important feature in any device. The screen was also not as stunning as the larger. For the price it's a decent phone but I was not purely impressed. I still have the 5.5 version and have very little negative remarks. It's definitely large which is the only thing I don't like. I wouldn't recommend the 4.7 version over other budget phones."
"Alcatel",5,"My day to day phone is a Samsung Note 4, so I wanted a smaller phone for times when the Samsung is just too large. I've only had the Idol for a day, but for most people who don't do serious gaming on a cell, it's a great bargain. It's very light, the software is basically stock Android so it's quite snappy, and the screen is satisfactory. Battery life seems to be ok, with enough power to last a whole day and charging is quite quick. The only real negatives I see is that the SIM/MicroSD card tray is a pain to use (which will only be an issue for those who swap phones a lot) and Wifi is 2.4 only (not 5). No, there is no way that this can be compared with a high end phone, but for the price it will do everything that probably 98% of phone users need. It will be interesting to see how many peopple keep buying $700 high-end phones now that American cell phone companies aren't playing the subsidy game anymore and people realize how much their free or $199 phone really costs."
"Alcatel",5,"Though it's only been 24 hours, I am super impressed by the Alcatel OneTouch Idol 3 4.7 inch smartphone (name is terrible though). This is a great time for affordable, mid-range, unlocked, no-contract smartphones. This phone slots in between the two models of the 3rd generation Moto G. Other than the RAM (1.5 GB vs 2 GB), it's very similar in specs to the more expensive Moto G model but at the price of the less expensive Moto G model (for now). I bought the Alcatel instead of the Moto G because it has a smaller, sleeker design (4.7 inch vs 5.0 inch screen and half as thin) and terrific front-facing stereo speakers. The screen is sharp and the speakers are very loud! The Idol 4.7 looks similar to the old Google Nexus 4, which I owned, but slimmer and sleeker (and more plasticy). It's a little smaller than an iPhone 6 despite having the same screen size, and about as thin. The Moto G has much more durable build and is waterproof, and I suspect, better support. Both the Alcatel and the Moto G make great backup or travel phones, and also starter smartphones for teens. They can also be very solid everyday phones for most consumers. As the wireless companies move away from contracts and subsidizing phones, I wonder whether more folks will start moving to some of the mid-range phones. Many folks have been paying $600-800 every two years for new phones without really knowing it. Perhaps Apple will be safe with its high-end clientele--at least for now--but companies like Samsung are very vulnerable. These $200 phones are more than good enough for the typical user--with performance comparable to the flagship phones from two years ago. I worry a bit about durability given the materials it's made out of. I should probably buy a case, but the phone is so sleek and attractive that I kind of don't want to put one on. Five stars for the amazing value! The Quality to price ratio for this phone is terrific."
"Alcatel",5,"This phone has blown away my expectations. In a world full of phablets and cell phones that seem to just be getting larger and larger (and more and more expensive as well), it's becoming seemingly harder and harder to find a small phone that will actually perform. This phone does just that, and does it well.Initially I had owned an LG G4. I thought about it and realized, man this is insane that I am spending $600+ on a cell phone. I decided to return the LG G4 and give the Alcatel Idol 3 5.5 a try. While I loved the phone, it was still larger than I was hoping, and the 4.7 had not yet been released. Then one day I checked Amazon, and the 4.7 was out, so I made the exchange (and I couldn't be happier).People may complain about the specs when compared to some current flagship phones. Are they as good? No. But here's the thing, just a year and a half ago or so, if you saw the specs on this phone, they would have blown you away. Think about the flagship phones from a year or two ago. Were they bad, slow, etc? No, they were top of the line. This phone has the same specs, if not better, that those phones had. That being said, I have not experienced a single hiccup with this phone yet. No lag when switching screens or apps, no delay in taking pictures, no freezing or apps crashing. So ask yourself, do I really NEED a phone with specs that the $600-900 phones are offering?Pros:Screen - It's beautiful. Is it 1080P? No, and it doesn't need to be. At 4.7"" 720P is gorgeous, and looks just as nice as my LG G4 did. Know what is awesome about the screen being 720P? Battery life. The ""lower"" resolution will greatly improve battery life.Sound - The JBL front facing stereo speakers are magnificent. The sound is very loud, and very clear. Watching music videos, listening to music, and even the alarm are all very impressive with the volume and clarity. The JBL headphones that come with the phone also have excellent sound and come with different size earbuds to ensure a good fit.Speed - It's fast. There's no lag when switching apps, browsing the web, multitasking, sending emails, etc. One review I read elsewhere of the phone stated that when typing, the phone would sometimes lag and have to ""catch up"" to his typing. I am a very fast typer, and I have yet to experience this, so YMMV.Size - Perfect. Everything can be done with one hand. It fits well in your palm. Very thin.Camera - 13MP rear, and 5MP front. Both take excellent photos. Most importantly to me, they both take photos QUICKLY. I have a one year old, and having to wait 2-3 seconds after pressing the capture button will often times make me miss the shot, or have them end up blurry. The Idol 3 takes it almost instantly 95% of the time.Battery Life - Very impressed. Having the ""slower"" processor, and the ""lower resolution"" screen, both help to improve the battery life greatly. I have been using the phone pretty much non stop since getting it. I am a heavy texter, social media user, and I use the music player with both a bluetooth speaker and a bluetooth stereo headset for 2+ hours a day. I have been setting the phone up and redownloading all the apps on my previous phones, so I have been on it constantly. End of the day it still has plenty of charge left to it. I imagine the average user will have no problem getting through a day, and a heavy user may be able to as well.Cost - Can't be beat, obviously. $179 for this phone is an absolute steal.Cons:Brand - Not because Alcatel is bad, but because it isn't popular. This means little 3rd party support for accessories and whatnot. Currently the only tempered glass screen protector available on Amazon is by Mr. Shield, and the fitment is very poor. There are not a lot of cases available at this time. Hopefully this will change as more people realize what a gem this phone is and actually start buying it.Overall, this phone is amazing and well worth your money. I can't imagine what you would be doing that requires a phone that costs $600 more than this phone, honestly. The size is perfect, it's fast, the sound is incredible, and the battery life has been awesome. Alcatel has a real winner in this phone. The only competition I see at this price point would be the new Moto G, however I love the form factor and design of the Alcatel."
"Alcatel",1,"Amazon service is excellent. Hence this review deserves atleast 1 star.I heard about this model in Feb 2015 when it was announced in CES. I was very much interested just because of form factor (I am not a fan of 5+"" and hefty phones). Was waiting to buy since then.. I think it was released in UK region in June then in US in September. Considering 5.5"" phone was priced at $199 for initial launch, I was hoping 4.7"" will be priced at $150 but it didnot. But I bought at for 180+ tax anyway.1) Though it was good initial days, battery drain (10% in 10 mins during non-usage of phone) and constant reboot (especially using camera) made me to return and get second phone.2) Second phone did not turn on et all. Did a factory reset and was able to turn on. Worked fine for 3-4 days and alas again same problem as above. Could not resist to return it back. Amazon is good in this process and hence I would buy from Amazon knowing my purchases are protected.For some days in October, this product was not available. There was notice ""there is some problem in inventory.. we will let you know when resolved"".. Not sure I got two defective items. I did noticed few good feedback on this phone here but somehow both phones didnt work for me. Good buy Alcatel."
"Alcatel",5,"This was a replacement after my alcatel idol 3 5.5 was stolen. I didn't like the 5.5 due to it's size and had been thinking about replacing it, but couldn't justify buying another phone for no reason. I always found the 5.5 a bit too large for my hands and for my pockets.The 4.7 is perfect for my hands but is slightly slower than the 5.5. The slowdown is barely noticeable, this phone also doesn't have a release yet for the latest version of android, however it works perfectly out of the box for everything I do. This phone has no bloatware other than an antivirus program and a couple of other small apps that are easily removed. It's about as pure of an android experience as you'll get out of the box. For the price, build quality and general ease of use, I highly recommend this for anyone who isn't into iphones."
"Alcatel",5,"its wonderful I love it"
"Alcatel",5,"Great phone so far at a great price!"
"Alcatel",5,"Phone has been great. Only smaller phone on the market at the time of purchase (couple months). Specs are fantastic for the price. OS is liveable.. Previous phone was a nexus 5. Hope its good for the next couple years... If not, I'm not out much money. Win win. Quality product."
"Alcatel",5,"I am really happy with this phone, especially for the price. It is very light and easy to operate. I recommend."
"Alcatel",1,"This phone is awful with its performance and the configuration which was mentioned in the product description is just on papers looks like nothing works. Below are the issues I'm facing 1. Battery sucks big time, I made sure I had 100% battery before I went to bed and morning the reading on batter power was just 37% left. There was no activity on the phone but battery drains for no reason. 2. LTE never worked so far (Please don't argue, I was able to get LTE speed with other cell phone with the same service provider) and also network drops and gets back again,this never happened with my age old android phone. 3 Phone's performance sucks, hard to believe that the configuration they have mentioned can choke to perform with hardly 2 applications installed newly with the phone(I have no games in phone and I just bought this phone 2 days back)PS: The outlook of the phone looks good and the sound is good (Thanks to JBL) but I'm surprised that amazon sells very cheap below par phone which don't perform as per the description. I love to shop with amazon with some confidence but not with doubts.****************************************************Update - things turned worse to worst!!!Below is the email sent to Amazon.I have issue with my phone it's not connecting with my phone network. From the day two when I got this phone I'm having issue with battery and I have also registered for return but unfortunately I didn't return due to circumstance now the situation is really worse as I'm not seeing signal reception with this phone. My friends, office colleagues and my manager started complaining that most of the time my call was hitting the voice mail, initially I thought it was an issue with my carrier but last month I figured out its the problem with the phone and now for the last couple of weeks this phone is not even attempting to connect, I'm using my 2009 Samsung basic smart phone now, with which I'm able to place and receive calls. It's a real nightmare and I have lost important interview calls as well because of this Alcatel phone. I have taken pictures for ref. Comparing my old Samsung and this Alcatel phone, but I'm unable to add here. Please help me on this regard. I just bought this phone because it was sold by Amazon by itself. Thanks!"
"Alcatel",5,"I love this phone!!"
"Alcatel",5,"Great unlocked phone that doesnt come with an insane amount of bloatware and works with AT&T. The camera is average and takes decent pictures with adequate sunlight but suffers in indoor lowlight."
"Alcatel",3,"It's ambidextrous gimmick sometimes screws up your phone call. People say I sound distant, which could mean that the mic and speaker don't switch as fast as the rest of the phone.The phone also shuts down at random or when charging in a car or mobile battery.Still pretty solid for the price though."
"Alcatel",3,"It works fine but I suspect the one I received is a fake"
"Alcatel",3,"The last phone I had worked perfectly but I dropped it in some water and needed to get a new one. The new one I got keeps restarting every time it drops on a hard surface. Might be a battery problem, not sure. Anyway not bad for the cost."
"Alcatel",4,"I have only had Alcatel as a smartphone . This is my second one. Does functions I need,Google search. Phone ,gps,e mail.wish gps aa little sooner with driving directions but much easier to use than car navigator"
"Alcatel",5,"4.5 star phone with a 2.5 star price. Wicked fat for my purposes which is document editing, online banking, paying bills, uber, sketching, torrenting, heavy map usage.... She screams with all of it. I've got about 25 apps installed and run most simultaneously without hiccups. Speed is killer. The ONLY thing I don't do is heavy gaming. What I have on here are for an 11 year old so it's Minecraft and goat simulator type games. 3D but nothing to press the hardware, so if that's your deal, your mileage may vary with this, though I wouldn't be shocked if it handles well enough. Final note: dual front speakers with the clearest and loudest I've owned on a phone. I had it on an external Bluetooth speaker and when switched to the phone speakers several people didn't believe me. Boom. I've never owned Alcatel (never heard of them until an Amazon search) and they, like every other product I bought on here have never given me a dime towards a discount or free gear. (Hint hint Amazon)"
"Alcatel",1,"DONT BUY THIS PHONE! It just died after five weeks and now ALCATEL will not return our calls to their customer service. We cannot get the information we need about the phone for the warranty because ALCATEL asks for numbers off the back that DO NOT EXIST on this model so I cannot send the phone in for service. It is great to get a one year warranty when the company IGNORES YOU so that they do not have to honor the warranty. They might as well offer a life-time warranty. This phone BITES and the company is HORRIBLE."
"Alcatel",5,"ok"
"Alcatel",5,"Great for the money and the sound quality is amazing"
"Alcatel",1,"NO GOOD"
"Alcatel",1,"Broke easily I'm pissed"
"Alcatel",3,"I've had this phone for about 7 months before I dropped it on its screen for the first time and it cracked.Usually with a cracked screen a phone is still functional.... that is not the case for the Idol 3.It was fine at first it has a really nice design and great display. The camera could be better, but I cant complain about that considering the price tag.The only thing other than the cracked screen problem was that the phone was oddly buggy?Certain apps I would use like Snapchat or Miitomo would just.... Stop Responding whenever I used them."
"Alcatel",5,"Perfect quality, fast performance"
"Alcatel",5,"I started looking for a new phone with 3 criteria:front facing speakers, decent gaming experience, and updates. This was one of only TWO budget smartphones i found. Yes, TWO. I almost bought the nexus 5x, but then i saw you could update this to Android 6. That's when I bought it. It has a very nice, vivid, bright display, and the JBL speakers are good and loud. It has decent battery life, especially if you just watch an occasional YouTube video. 4G LTE works well, and its fast on wifi too. I get hi fps on Riptide GP 2 on high settings, and most other games and 360 video work well. If you really want an immersive experience with a small price tag, this is the phone I would recommend. Oh btw, update to Android 6 before you activate a service plan. I had to tweak APN settings after the update to keep using the phone service. It's just less hassle. Had it for a month and i love it."
"Alcatel",5,"Everything ok!! The phone is perfect 😍"
"Alcatel",4,"A decent mid range phone..Does everything I need it to do..Taste varies per person..Marshmallow OS is great, the sound is AWESOME!.A little slow in some areas, but not a BIG deal breaker..For the price DEFINITELY worth looking into .."
"Alcatel",5,"very nice"
"Alcatel",5,"The phone has a sleek design and very comfortable. It froze on three occasions when I multitask end with several apps running and making a call. Happened on three different occasions during my one month use before my phone was stolen. All of my colleagues loved my phone and some wanted to place in orders. The sound is good (loud as appropriate), pictures very clear, built-in music player (turntable) fantastic. Gaming is also fun and the reversible OS a bomb! I have placed in another order to replace my missing phone already. Love the volume key as the camera shutter, it makes taking multiple shots so much easier and convenient. Camera can even be activated when screen is locked without unlocking the phone. Finally, I love the eye unlock but it is difficult using this feature at night or with insufficient light, which is complemented by another option (I.e pin code). Tried to lock phone many times by turning it over but never seemed to get this right, will try again though. Did not have much time to experiment with all the features of the phone before loosing it, but will surely spend more time with the next one. Too bad the 4.7 inch is single sim, I would have loved a dual sim 4.7 in. Also, I wished the inbuilt radio was wireless (could play without inserting the earpiece jack). For delivery and contents, I got it in time and the box contained all all items outlined on Amazon, new and working."
"Alcatel",5,"This is my favorite smartphone of all time. Cheap as dirt, value to hardware second to none, powers through a camera app, three audio apps (soundcloud, bandcamp and spotify), medicore but definitely playable Pokemon Go ability, light google drive use, and it keeps chugging.They definitely had to sacrifice a bit on structural durability to save on cost so please put this in a case as it won't withstand too many hard falls."
"Alcatel",5,"For the money this phone has some nice features the top brands do not have. Loudspeaker phone. Reversible UI and a nice vivid display. For me it was too big."
"Alcatel",5,"It is a good phone"
"Alcatel",4,"I will be honest about this device i did not like it at first and i wanted to sell it in the next hr after opening it not because it was messed up or the packaging was destroyed because tbh the package and the device is and was flawless (for the device of course lol) but after i downloaded tons of apps (well not tons but a lot more then i had on my last phone) i love this phone. Its fast and its definitely slim. However when i go to go on Facebook i cant go live and on top of that i cant do the emojis like the heart button for the like etc Please bring back that !!"
"Alcatel",4,"This was a gift for my brother. He absolutely love it. It has a perfect fit for a man's pocket and great speakers. The only con I can mention for now is the battery life. One of its great features is the design, seems like a more expensive cell phone."
"Alcatel",5,"Seems to be a great phone at a very reasonable price point for the specs that are on it."
"Alcatel",1,"It wasn't a unlocked phone so I returned it."
"Alcatel",5,"good"
"Alcatel",5,"I'm very late on the smartphone bandwagon mostly because of plan prices and phone prices, but I found a $30/mo tmobile prepaid plan and all that was left was to find a phone. I did a lot (A LOT) of research over a few months, and landed on this model because of price, ram, reviews, and the availability of being on tmobile band 12.Since this is my first phone I don't have anything to compare it to, but I do love it, can't go back to a basic now. I've had it just approaching 2 months and no complaints with the software or usability. The call quality isn't so great, but it could be just that I work in an area that maybe have bad reception, and getting the sim card in was such a chore, the card kept falling out while trying to slide it back in - frustrating but i eventually got it in. The camera is fine, the display is great, the sound! my god the sound blew me away. Overall you can't go wrong for the price, and I bought a case with screen protector on amazon as well for $8. I highly recommend if you're looking for a phone with not much bloatware, enough ram and easy usability."
"Alcatel",5,"very nice phone ,it goto have marshmallow?"
"Alcatel",5,"Idol 3 is the best phone I ever owned, And I've owned plenty of high priced cell phones in the past, unlocked is the way to go."
"Alcatel",5,"Very goog"
"Alcatel",5,"Replaced my Galaxy S5 with the idol 3 4.7 and could not be happier! Snappy fast, clear display,basically stock android so none of that Samsung bloat ware you can't remove. The size fits in your pocket and easy to operate with one hand. Battery last me all day with solid use. Love this phone, it was a great purchase!"
"Alcatel",5,"I rarely write reviews but I believe I will be doing a greater good if I share my experience. I have had Iphone 4s, and Iphone 5s in the past. The reason I had iPhone in the past was its reliability and battery life. However, I had to switch to another phone when I broke my iPhone (I did not want to pay a premium price to get another phone) and was looking for an option with the best value for money.Alcatel one touch idol 3 4.7"" is a hidden gem. So far, I am EXTREMELY happy with the phone. The image quality is superb even though it has 720p screen resolution. I did not find any difference with iPhone or any higher resolution phone. In fact its the vibrant screen makes it so much more appealing than the rather neutral iPhone. Next, the sound quality of the speakers. Just Wow! Can't believe this phone has incredible speakers. Love watching netflix, youtube or listening to music in my phone. My wife cannot figure out if the sound is coming from the cell phone or the television. The next most important factor is the battery in this phone. Till now, I have observed that its life is as good as iPhone. This phone has more juice left towards the end of the day than an iPhone. I am surprised but thats the fact. Though the phone drains more battery when the navigation App is used, but again I won't complain about it. The Apps start and run very fine. There had been some occasion, when the app may not fire up. In that case, I would just free up the memory and it would work fine. This is hardly a concern.Another best feature of this phone is the form factor. The phone is so thin, that it immediately draws attention. Besides being thin, it very light and I do not feel it in my pocket. 4.7"" is the perfect size for the phone. Its not too big and not too small. Perfect for reading, watching, chatting and other day to day activities. I love this phone!I can't believe I had been wasting my money on iPhones when I had so much better option. Android really gives you a much better option to customize with widgets. I would suggest a new user to spend sometime to personalize this phone with better wallpaper, widgets, changing the default options for apps. Then you will love it as much as I do. Go for it and I would bet you will be amazed."
"Alcatel",5,"Great phone for the cost! My wife doesn't like big phones, but doesn't want to be stuck with the typical cheap phone you have to get that has a smaller size. Calls are clear (HD calls supported on T-Mobile), screen is great quality for a phone this size, and the photos aren't too bad. Performance is way better than expected. The fact that it has 16GB of space and 1.5GB of RAM makes it really worth the money when compared to other phones in this price range (most have 8GB of space or only 1GB of RAM). The only downside for T-Mobile users is that it doesn't support Band 12, but we don't have that in our area, so it's not an issue. Very recommended for those who want a smaller but good performing phone!"
"Alcatel",1,"This phone seemed great at the beginning, but it has proven to be a terrible purchase. I bought one for my husband and for myself, but both of ours have had constant call quality issues. I dropped my cell phone which was definitely my fault, but only the corner was slightly cracked. When I woke up this morning after leaving my phone on the table overnight, the crack had spread throughout the top half of the screen and now the screen no longer works. It's $150 to replace the screen which is almost what the phone cost. This would be a great phone if not for the slow power on, the terrible call quality and the clearly terribly designed screen. Buyer beware!"
"Alcatel",5,"For the price, it's unbeatable. Buy the screen protector. I didn't and that was just a silly, silly mistake."
"Alcatel",5,"Excellent phone!Price-wise and result of handset are quite good.Overall good purchase."
"Alcatel",3,"It's been 6 months after I bought this product. Internal storage is 12gb only and the phone stop vibrating a month ago. I'm thinking of getting a warranty.Other than that, the design is sleek and beautiful."
"Alcatel",2,"Android goes a little awkward, sometimes it crashes and most of the time overheats out of nothing. The worst thing about this cellphone is the screen, it broke after 2 weeks of use. I was playing Cytus (music game in which you have to press bubbles to score) and suddenly I just couldn't play anymore. I looked at the screen and it was broken from corner to corner. I don't really know if I hit the screen too hard (which I don't think so) or the material is way too bad. I was pretty excited about this smartphone since it reminded me of my now old Moto G. I don't recommend buying this phone."
"Alcatel",5,"I love it"
"Alcatel",4,"I really like this phone. My needs are rather small when it comes to electronics. I don't play games or watch movies. I don't like a lot of apps. And I refuse to pay $600 for a piece of equipment that will be obsolete by next year. That being said, this phone is great. The phone, yes I actually use the phone, comes in clear. It is an android and comes with google play, so you can get all your fancy apps. It takes great pictures. And is very user friendly. I literally just plugged in my SIM card and I was good to go. It is a very established brand, just hasn't had much luck breaking into the US market. But I suspect it will. Everyone is always asking me what my phone is. I had a Samsung before, and very much prefer this one. Do not feel like you are stuck with the very limited and expensive selection that the carriers provide. There are tons of great phones out there that may not be as fashionable, but will do everything the big boys can, at a third of the price. Do your homework!"
"Alcatel",5,"Excellent !"
"Alcatel",5,"Nice, solid Android smartphone. I wear my phone on my belt and wanted to keep the smaller footprint. The display is really good, the speakers are great. I am very satisfied and it doesn't add $25 to $30 to my phone bill like buying phones on AT&T's new plan."
"Alcatel",5,"It is a good cellphone"
"Alcatel",5,"one of the best phones I've bought"
"Alcatel",1,"It's not reliable product, because it's a calamity"
"Alcatel",1,"I want to love this phone but:1. it won't record phone calls with Android 6.01, I heard this is a deliberated HW setting from the manufacture. This is a shame.2. The screen auto dim doesn't work. Seriously, such basic feature!"
"Alcatel",5,"My first smart phone and am very satisfied. I did not want a large phone and this was the perfect size. Also could not justify paying more than a couple hundred for a ""phone"". Love it. Has just enough features that I would use. Bought one for my sister also and we both agree it has enough of what we need."
"Alcatel",5,"Great entry phone and it would be a good phone for average users too. Smooth performance for everyday tasks. Both cameras are fair, take shots quite fast. Sound quality is above average, nice and loud, and it comes with JBL in-ear earphones, which are quite good too. Also features an update to Android Marshmallow, available as soon as you turn on the phone. Battery isn't great but it lasts for the day. Overall quality is really good, it's as good as I expected for the money I spent."
"Alcatel",2,"Good phone but the seller misled in its add. Yes , it unlocked , international but it only had 5 language. I mean it as a gift for someone who doesn't know English, French, Spanish or German. I needed Russian but it was not there!!! So make sure you are getting a phone with a language options for setting commands /tools that you'd actually know"
"Alcatel",5,"I'm really happy with this phone. It is packed to the brim with features, has a very modern Android (it updated to 6.0 right after I unpacked it and connected it), has tons of storage space (I added an 32 GB SD card, so I now have about 45 GB of free space to store applications and data - thank's to Android 6's ""emulated storage"" built-in feature). It looks beautiful, has the perfect size (4.7"" is not too small, but also not too large), and the speakers sound great. People are genuinely impressed when I show them my new phone, and even more so when I tell them how little I paid for it - this is definitely NOT one of the crappy half-functioning super-cheap phones - this phone is a rare combination of being great and cheap."
"Alcatel",5,"This phone is amazing! I love it so much! It is the best phone I have had so far. It comes with some apps already( clock, calendar, etc.). Overall it is a great phone for a great price!"
"Alcatel",5,"Bought this for my wife and she loves it! No more deleting files and apps every weekend, plenty of storage space. Convenient size and very responsive. Great phone for this price!"
"Alcatel",4,"Pros:Super lightGreat stereo speakershad the latest androidpicks up all t-Mobile bandsStylish design - sleek and beautifulCons:Camera is bad. Not good for high res photos like the more expensive phones.There is a dead pixel/white spot in my screen. I didn't want to get the phone replaced just because of that, so I live with that everyday. Not very noticeable thoughSome apps take a while to load, but work fine once loaded. Hey..you get only so much RAM for what you pay."
"Alcatel",3,"This phone does not have gorilla glass. After six months the screen cracked for no reason. I used a case and did not drop it. A little pressure flexed the phone and cracked the screen. My boyfriend had the Idol 3 5.5 in, and his screen cracked without being dropped also. I should have read more reviews. The phone is too flexible, and the screen is not strong. I googled it, and it is a common problem.UPDATE: The phone screen did crack, and it was a design flaw. However, Alcatel honored their warranty and repaired the screen. I was not happy that the phone was damaged that easily, but it is one of the best phones that I have ever had. I gave it three stars because it is fragile, but I would give customer service a five star. The repair and customer service is the only reason why this review is not a one star."
"Alcatel",3,"Average phone; decent features all around and nice thin form factor.The battery is non-removable. That knocks an entire star off.Android Lollipop is... deficient. That knocks the second star off. Lollipop has numerous issues. Hotspot doesn't always work with all clients and mDNS is flaky, weird media player/background behavior, etc. All known issues, all classified as ""won't-fix"". This is endemic of all Lollipop devices.Otherwise the performance and specs of the phone are actually pretty decent."
"Alcatel",5,"This is a great budget Android phone! Perfect size and weight at 4.7"" and 3.88 oz. Takes an SD card for expandable storage.Great speakers for a small phone! Excellent display.Can't beat it for the price!"
"Alcatel",5,"After a series of more flagship handsets (Samsung Galaxy series), I was afraid a lower-end device like the Idol 3 might be a let-down. But I wanted something in this smaller form-factor. And I am not disappointed. It seems very well built, smooth operation, seems great. Can't believe it was as cheap as it was! It's missing some features of the flagships - fingerprint sensor, for example - and doesn't have quite the same CPU specs, so maybe some high-end games might suffer. But for ""normal"" daily use, it is great!"
"Alcatel",4,"The pro is it's a good solid case that protects my phone. The con is with the case on, it's hard to turn on and off, you have to really mash the button on the case (which is a pain)."
"Alcatel",4,"From my wife: ""Before mine arrived, I set up my husband's phone which is the same make/model but a 5.5 inch screen. I really enjoyed the screen size of his phone and didn't realize how much I did until I received mine. While all of the features are identical, and I couldn't be happier with the speed and ease of the phone, I wish I had purchased the larger screen size. The only other complaint that I have is how the photos look when taken indoors. While this still could be user error as I have only had the phone for about a week, the colors while taken inside seem to be a bit on the yellow side and not quite as sharp as I had hoped. Outdoor photos are wonderful, however! Another issue I have with the phone is with texting. While using the speech-to-text, if I need to correct an error, the very last word I say is repeated when I attempt to erase it. Not a big deal but it bugs me that I can't figure out why it does this. If given the option to purchase another phone, I would have still purchased this model but in a 5.5 inch."""
"Alcatel",5,"This phone is just want I want it"
"Alcatel",3,"You get what you pay for. I have issues when I punch my code in. The screen will stay black for about 15 to 30 seconds before it wakes up. Then it will populate with a few icons form the apps, it will populate slowly, not all at once. Also after entering you unlock the phone the screen will populate correctly but it will not respond. You will need to tap the back button in order to get the screen to fully unlock. I keep on getting a message about an unsent text. I deleted every text thread I had, so no more messages right? Wrong, I deleted every text message I had and I still get the message that I have an unsent text. I would recommend for a short term phone or one that isn't used that much."
"Alcatel",5,"Awesome phone the sound on this is really crisp and clean great phone for the price"
"Alcatel",3,"It freezes sometimes, and when you make a call, the ringtone gets very low. And when you put it on gesture, the screen doesn't respond to tapping it consistently."
"Alcatel",5,"First Smart phone. Easy to use. long battery life."
"Alcatel",2,"Received in box: Phone, sim tray tool, charger w/ cord, JBL in-ear headphones w/ variety of tips, and multi-language manual.Let me start this review by stating that I've had cell phones for nearly 20 years. I always tend to go ""middle of the road"" with my phone models, keep them 1-2 years, then get a new one. No flagships, but no junk, either. I've had LG, Samsung, Moto, etc. Most of the big players in the American market. I've never had an iPhone. I mention this to give a frame of reference on how my experience with cell phones was formed.When I was shopping for a phone, I just happened across this one. I had heard of Alcatel before, but never really considered any of their phones. The reviews of this particular model all seemed favorable, and at this price-point it seemed like a really solid choice. I won't re-hash the basic specs that you can read all over the internet, but I'll touch on some things that I've noted and liked/disliked:First impression of the phone: It has a very nice look about it. It's very thin and very light in the hand. The whole face of the unit is glass, and the sides are chromed plastic that give a pretty high-quality look, overall. No complaints.The phone comes with a surprisingly nice set of JBL in-ear headphones with mic and controller. I don't personally like this style of earbuds, but I did try them out and was definitely pleased with the sound quality of music, videos, and phone calls.After inserting my sim and SD cards, and charging up for a bit, I turned on the unit. It walked me through a pretty standard set-up routine, then I let it update Android, and put my usual apps on it. After a bit of personalization and sorting out un-used apps, this thing was ready to go. All the while, I noticed how nice the screen was and how apps popped open quickly, and just the overall positive impression the phone gave me.My observations:-To me the most important thing with a cell phone is... its ability to function like a phone. It seems weird to feel the need to state this, but I bet a lot of people rarely actually call people and talk to them w/ their cell phones. I have T-Mobile, and while I generally don't have reception issues, my neighborhood actually seems to be pretty spotty and my last phone would often drop calls in certain sections of my neighborhood. In my house, I would often have to use my wi-fi to make calls. The Alcatel works better than any other phone I've tried. It never dropped calls, crystal clear reception and people that I've talked to said it sounded like my calls were as clear as a landline.-The speakers on the Alcatel are really quite good, considering the size. Music sounds really nice on the speakers, and the output to headphones is above average. I like that there are 2 speakers, one at either end of the phone. Gives a bit of stereo effect if you're watching a video.-The picture quality of the screen is quite nicer than I expected. Colors are good, images seem decently sharp. Not as nice as a Galaxy, or iPhone, but... look at the price difference. I watched a bunch of Netflix, Youtube, etc. and I was really impressed overall.-I found the size of the unit to be almost perfect for me. I actually am a very tall guy, big hands, etc. and you would think that I'd like a bigger phone, but honestly, I like to be able to put the phone in my pocket, or be able to access all of the functions with one hand. Overall, it's just convenient for me to have this size. I really wish that phone manufacturers would settle down with making ever-larger phones and make some quality ones in this size.-The battery life is very good. I am not exactly a ""heavy user"" but I do make calls, check emails, check Twitter, and watch the occasional vid. I don't really do games, aside from the occasional solitaire. I leave the wifi and GPS on 24/7. I easily got over a day before needing to charge. If I had particularly light usage during a day and didn't watch any video, I could go nearly 40 hours before needing to plug-in.-I am not any kind of expert on Android's different iterations. I don't tweak my phones, or run different ROMS or anything like that. I can say that this phone's OS/ skin/ whatever didn't bug me. It just worked. No complaints. Seemed like standard Android fare that I'm used to, and nothing raised any flags for me. Just a decent system with things doing what I expected them to do.-The cameras, both front and back, are pretty good, I think. I take a lot of pictures for work and hobbies, but not for ""portraits"" or anything like that, more record-keeping. My requirements are pretty low. I can say that with good lighting, the rear camera took very nice pictures. If you're used to phones in this price range, the cameras are going to seem pretty normal. Nothing bad to report, just a solid camera.As for what I didn't like about the phone:-This is very subjective, and not really a big deal (actually it's bordering on silly of me, if I'm being honest): the power button was on the left side andthe volume rocker was on the right. This is opposite of every other phone I've had. I was constantly turning the phone off when I had been intending to change the volume. As I said, not a big deal, but just something I thought I'd mention.**AND NOW FOR WHY I RATED THIS 2 STARS:**-The astute reader will note that most of this is written in the past tense. I have returned the phone. As much as I like nearly everything about this phone, I experienced a deal-breaking problem with two of these.My first phone had a stuck pixel in the lower right section of the screen. When viewing lighter colors on the screen, it wasn't terribly noticeable. But when viewing darker materials or movies, or whatever, it really stuck out. I guess I'm pretty lucky in that I've never had a phone with any kind of problems, but I'm realistic. I know problems slip through the cracks sometimes. I just figured it was ""my turn"" to get a bad one. No big deal. Thank goodness for Amazon Prime, right? So I sent it back, and ordered another one. After a day or two of using the new phone, I noticed that the screen had a problem in roughly the same area as the other one, though it was a different problem. Lower right hand side of the screen. When running my finger across the screen, I'd get a distortion in that spot like when you press a flatscreen too hard. I wasn't pressing too hard, though. No different than any other area of the screen. While this defect was much less bothersome than the stuck pixel, it was still a problem, and I figured it would only get worse with time. So, back it went while it was still under the return period for Amazon.So, overall, I cannot recommend this particular phone. I really wanted to like it, but the fact that it had a screen problem on two of them in the same spot kind of spooked me off of it. I will keep my eye on the Alcatel Idol series and may try it again someday, as I really was impressed with so many aspects of this phone."
"Alcatel",5,"Unlocked LTE works perfectly in Tigo Guatemala."
"Alcatel",5,"It's a nice piece of tech. Only thing I'm looking to change is the way it fades from on song to another, the overlap can ruin the end of a song. I bet there's a way to stop it and I just have to keep playing with the phone to find how."
"Alcatel",5,"Great phone for a reasonable price. Totally satisfied."
"Alcatel",1,"DO NOT BUY THIS PHONE! FRAUDULENT LISTING! NOT AN IDOL3! SMALL CRAPPY PHONE WITH BOX THATVSAYS ""idol3"" Alcatel Sucks!!!"
"Alcatel",5,"I admit I was skeptical at first with an off-name brand I'd never heard of. But this phone rocks! Fast. No glitches. Great speakers. Expandable memory. Only drawbacks are it's not as bright as my old Samsung or camera quite as sharp, but they're more than good enough. I'd buy it again. Nuf said."
"Alcatel",4,"I bought this to replace my galaxy s3 when it started to break, and I am very pleased.It has some qualities of a flagship phone at flip phone price,"
"Alcatel",5,"Love this phone for the price. Good features, sounds, Lollipop works fine."
"Alcatel",5,"Nice inexpensive android phone. It is also pretty light and a decent size (in an era of phablets, this size is still OK)."
"Alcatel",4,"Great phone! Very recommended"
"Alcatel",3,"I really wanted to like this device, but after opening it I noticed a bright spot near the bottom of the display. After a few days this spot grew into two and got much brighter. Tapping the screen, made that area flash almost as if it were under a lot of pressure.Performance of the phone was good, but in the end I returned it before the display issue really panned out. Does not matter how inexpensive a product is, it should arrive in 100% working condition."
"Alcatel",4,"I have no desire to give up this phone! Everything has made me happy so far. Sound Quality: the sound is amazing for a cell phone and perhaps its most bright quality. There are dual front speakers which produce LOUD, crystal clear music. You wouldn't think a phone could have the capability to have professional sound. Out of all the phones I've tested, this phone wins first place award for sound.Battery Charge: The battery is decent. I use the phone heavily and charge the phone about once a night, which is reasonable. Of course, if you're browsing the web and watching videos, the battery drains very quickly. But if you're listening to Spotify or something and put the phone on lock, the battery would last a much longer time. With light use, I've gone 2-3 days without charging the phone.Storage: 16GB is great. I've downloaded 10+ apps with ease, not to mention my picture Gallery which probably contains thousands of photos and a music library with maybe 200 songs. Most phones at this price contain a lower amount of storage.Durability: Unfortunately, this phone's glass is much more fragile since it does NOT use Gorilla Glass like many smartphones. I've had a few average drops which caused my tempered glass screen protector to crack. If you buy this phone, you MUST have a tempered glass screen protector.Overall, I love this phone and believe I will keep it for a long time. I highly recommend you purchase it. It's definitely worth paying more than $180 for! It has lots of storage, awesome sound, a very attractive & sleek design, good enough battery, and more."
"Alcatel",5,"I was completely happy with this phone, I would have you without thinking."
"Alcatel",5,"Excellent product"
"Alcatel",5,"Great price, great phone."
"Alcatel",5,"This phone hits all my requirements! Inexpensive, great cameras, front and rear, although there are definitely better ones out there, this does great.Very quick, only hangs up a few times and it is very minor. Love the front-facing speakers and dual microphones.My only complaints is that you can't uninstall the bloatware that comes pre-installed on the phone, but very minor.I've used the phone for about 6 months and its been great,. Although it's been very durable I HIGHLY recommend a case; I dropped it several times and it finally developed a small crack which doesn't respond to touch on the bottom quarter of the phone. My work around is enabling the reverse screen feature.Never used it before, but saved my wallet another purchase with that feature."
"Alcatel",5,"This is a GREAT phone for a very affordable price! I am on AT&T goPhone plan and activation was a snap!"
"Alcatel",5,"Very good phone for the price. Switching from old Korean Samsung Note. I wanted something smaller and this 4.7"" IDOL 3 is perfect for me. The only downside is the new firmware installed on it which locked the boot-loader. I was hoping to flash a custom ROM on it, but so far unsuccessful. Can get root access to remove apps that are useless to me, but not many of those anyway. Very simple launcher interface with limited customization features Alcatel (TCL) gives us. Custom launcher is the answer to that (i'm using MIUI which I like personally, it gives me more customization options and its free). I would actually go with Huawei P8 Light instead (MIUI, design, and hardware) but it's missing this one Band frequency that i need to use overseas sometimes. P8 Light is my first choice for the phone under $200 to use in the States, but IDOL 3 is truly Global. That's the only reason it's not P8 light on the other end of the line of whoever is talking to me :) I'm happy either way. My money spent well."
"Alcatel",5,"Perfect cell phone"
"Alcatel",5,"Very good"
"Alcatel",5,"Iv'e had the phone for around a week now and just love it. From the form factor to the amazing front firing speakers to the intuitive stock android lollipop interface. I am using it on cricket wireless and everything just worked right away once i popped my sim card in. Wifi and LTE reception are on par or possibly superior to the LG G2 i replaced. Battery life on standby isnt quite as good as my G2, but while actually using the phone (watching videos especially) it mops the floor of the G2 in terms on on screen time. This is due to the lower res (but still very nice) screen and lower power snapdragon 410 CPU. Dont let the lower power fool you, ive yet to run into any scenario the phone hasnt performed just as well as my G2, which on paper is twice as fast. Just a heads up to buyers of the 5.5"" model (too big for my tastes, but seems to be the preferred size nowadays) is that it is coming to cricket wireless nov 6th for 149.00 bucks, 100 bucks off retail. Mind you it wont be unlocked, this would just be for people using cricket, and as a cricket customer i have only good things to say about them (they use ATT towers, they are the best MNVO by miles).The only con i can come up with on the phone is that it does not beep at you when fully charged, but the LED light goes off after its been at 100% for a couple minutes. I remedied this with an app called Gsam for the app store, now my phone beeps when it hits 100% :)In my opinion this blows away the competition (looking at you moto g) for the money, 16gb storage and 1.5gb memory really put it head and shoulders above other phones in this price range. Not to mention the better screen, absurdly loud speakers and overall dainty form factor (for a phone in 2015).Trust me, you will not regret this purchase, especially if you are looking for a phone under the ""norm"" 5""+ form factor."
"Alcatel",5,"Great product! I'm loving the smaller phone. It's a breath of fresh air from all these phablets and near phablets. I guess I'm in a minority for wanting a smaller phone. Battery life is great and performance is really good. I can't see any lags navigating through menus. I don't play games on my phone so I'm not sure how good the graphics processor. It has outstanding standby time. The screen is great even under sun light. The phone is very light and it produces incredible sound from its dual stereo front facing speakers. The screen is very crisp despite not being 1080P (not a knock, anything below 5"" screen doesn't need a 1080P screen). I've had the 5.5"" version but found it a bit too big for my taste. This phone is perfect, it's even a tad bit smaller than an iPhone 6/6S. 16GB is fine paired up with my 64GB Sandisk memory card. I didn't even think about the Moto G 2015 because with 16GB it's already close to the Idol 3 5.5"" ~$250 price. I'm not so worried about updates. As long as there are security patches and the apps work, then it's fine."
"Alcatel",5,"Excellent! Many thanks."
"Alcatel",5,"Great product"
"Alcatel",5,"Nice it was allá that im expected"
"Alcatel",5,"I was originally looking for a Samsung phone, but I wanted the latest version of Android in a phone that would fit in my pocket. The Idol 3 was just what I needed. Pictures are great for a phone, the OS runs smoothly, battery life is good - gets me through the day easily on a full charge, and it's a great size. The only irritating thing is answering the ""what kind of phone is that?"" question then watching the confused looks because they've never heard of Alcatel. I'm certainly glad to have skipped the ""big names""."
"Alcatel",5,"The phone looks nice and works smoothly. Definitely worth the price. The cameras, both front and back, take crisp clear pictures. Very happy with the product."
"Alcatel",5,"Excelent phone for the price"
"Alcatel",5,"The phone came without issues. Have a great display and the processor responds well. Visually have a great look. For the price is a very good acquisition."
"Alcatel",3,"This phone is marred by unacceptable Bluetooth performance. It literally drops my Bluetooth headset when I put it in my pants pocket! On the plus side, the sound and speaker phone functionality is quite good, as other reviewers have mentioned. It also is not an exceptionally rugged phone as the screen broke after a fall from less than 3 feet."
"Alcatel",5,"Phone was purchased for my son. He's loving the phone so far and has been using it for a couple of months now. Takes pretty good pictures. Phone is snappy even only having 1.5gb of ram. Doesn't crash when he uses Snapchat which he's very happy about!!! His prior phone would crash on some apps. I'd highly recommend this phone for anybody on a budget & wanting a decent mid-range phone. Also, for anybody wondering this device did receive the Android M (Marshmallow) update."
"Alcatel",5,"Very happy with this phone. My last one was also an Alcatel but only 4 gig, not near enough for all the popular software and photographs. 16 gig seems really good for my needs. Would buy again!"
"Alcatel",2,"The call quality is terrible, something between fade and tin can. Camera is ok, but image quality well below my previous phones, a Moto G and an LG. Most frustrating of all, after a month, the first time I dropped the phone the screen shattered and that was with an outer casing accessory. The only redeeming quality was the compact size."
"Alcatel",4,"On point and fair at $149. I love this little phone!"
"Alcatel",5,"Great phone"
"Alcatel",4,"Great phone and much more dependable than other phones in its price range. Great pics and easy to use. The only con is battery life. If you use location services and bluetooth then you must charge everyday. Other than that I love the phone."
"Alcatel",5,"The phone came in its original box with a security seal, not only did it come with a good charger(the one that you can plug into a computer or wall) but it also came with JBL headphones.Also, product came in 2 days.I cant believe I got all this with such good quality for such a good price.Definitely a good buy."
"Alcatel",4,"Pretty solid battery life. Fast. BIG sound. Just wish the camera had a little more zoom and the screen is only about 4in max. But the camera is quite clear and good hd screen"
"Alcatel",5,"We bought two of these phones (at full price, so this is an actual customer review, not one that may be biased by having received it for free or at a discount) a few months ago and still really love them. We spent quite a bit of time researching all of the options available both above and below this price range, and this phone looked to be a great value, and it really is. We are very pleased with our purchase. We use it with T-Mobile on one of their pre-paid plans and have had a very good experience with the phone and T-Mobile. We are also going to be traveling outside the country, and this phone comes unlocked and supports all of the bands that we need.Pros: The screen looks great, and is very bright and crisp. The camera takes very nice pictures and video. The phone fits nicely in the hand and looks and feels like a much more expensive phone. The build quality is excellent. We charge them after a couple days of normal use, so the battery seems to last a respectable amount of time. The sound, as other reviewers have mentioned, is just excellent. This thing can really put out some sound, and gone are the days of not being able to hear your phone ring! Playing music on it sounds great, and is stereo (one speaker at each end of the phone). The phone is reversible, with a microphone and speaker at each end, so it doesn't matter which way its facing when you pick it up to answer it, the phone will just take care of it based on the orientation using the gyro sensor. This isn't really a must have feature, but it is kind of nice. It plays videos (such as YouTube) very well, and it feels very smooth and responsive in every app we've tried. The value for the money is great, and we would still be very happy with it if we paid more.Cons:Wish it supported dual sim cards instead of just one, but you get a microSD card spot instead, so not too bad and most people probably only need one sim card slot anyway.Wish the volume could be adjusted in smaller increments, but this isn't the phone's fault, it's an android thing and not a deal breaker at all.In closing, we are very pleased with our purchase of two of these phones and would quickly and happily buy them again. If you are looking for a great unlocked GSM phone and don't want to pay an arm and a leg, then give this one a try. We highly recommend it!"
"Alcatel",4,"Very nice phone. It is a simple phone but it work good. Maybe the camera not perfect but for the price it is a worthy phone.I am from the caribbean and the phone work ok. It is indeed unlocked."
"Alcatel",5,"Excelent!"
"Alcatel",1,"WORST PHONE I EVER HAD! EVER! WORST! TERRIBLE! DONT BUY! Holds battery for less than a day..."
"Alcatel",5,"Speakers are so clear. Don't find reversible feature useful. Needed 16gb ROM and this fit the criteria."
"Alcatel",5,"This seems to be a great little phone.When I saw it would cost $700 to get a new Samsung to replace my old S3, I shopped around. I bought the Alcatel Idol 3 (4.7"") from Amazon and after a week am pretty much thrilled at how well it works.The setup had some bumps for me because my cloud files were not up to date. My advice here is to update your contacts, files (including downloads), and pictures before cluttering the new phone with junk So don't log in to your Google acount (yes, even just for email) until stuff is updated and synch'ed up on the old phone.Also, perhaps because the Alcatel phone is ""unlocked"" and is not a service provider's proprietary device, it does not wake up in your hand knowing how to handle internet data. When you enter an in-range WiFi password, the Internet will work fine. To get it to work when you do NOT have WiFi, you will need to setup the mobile networks. This might be as easy as selecting your; provider in settings:(wireless networks - more - mobile networks - access point names - and then either select yourprovider.) You might need to enter the info manually if your provider is not listed. I found listings online by searching for ""AT&T Alcatel APN settings"" but didn't need it because my carrier is AT&T and there was a preconfigured choice as I described earlier.The ""unlocked"" feature is great because it means the phone works with SIM chips from any provider. So if I switch from AT&T to Verizon, Sprint, or any other service provider, this phone will work instantly as soon as I insert the chip. Also, if I travel to a foreign country -- in addition to being able to function on multiple networks --, I will be able to buy a chip for any country and put it into my own phone. If you have travelled, you know what I am talking about. Using your own phone is wonderful in foreign countries.NOTE: My phone accepted a memory chip in addition to the SIM; I see you CAN get a dual SIM option; which I do not understand. The little chip carrier can removed by pushing a paper clip into the tiny hole on the left side of the phone. The little tray slides all the way out. The chips do not fit snugly, but must be sort of balanced or set carefully and then inserted gently. I was actually surprised when it worked because the whole process seemed to require more faith than skill. The phone is so small and compact, it is easy to forgive this space saving compromise.I haven't compared the camera, but it seems fine. I got accustomed to popping the back off my Samsung and just dropping in a newly charged battery, but the Alcatel is sealed. I guess if the battery dies I will need to send it in for service or just replace the whole thing.In general, I think there are enough good reasons to give this phone a try and it is a low risk. Alcatel also makes a 5.5"" phone, so if you want a bigger unit, it's an option.I know this sounds almost evangelical, but I do pay attention to details. Seems like a winner to me."
"Alcatel",5,"Love it. Definitely worth the great price. I have owed mine for over six months and love it. Second Alcatel phone I have owed only bought new one because I was ready to upgrade. Love these phones. price is wonderful."
"Alcatel",5,"Wow this phone I recomend!!! Excellent"
"Alcatel",4,"Nice phone"
"Alcatel",5,"Perfect unlocked Android phone. Very light weight and very slim. Phone has worked flawlessly on AT&T prepaid with 4G LTE coverage where available."
"Alcatel",5,"My daughter loved it."
"Alcatel",5,"Now, this is a nice phone. Nice, clear screen. At 5.5 inches, it is definitely larger than my previous Moto G 2013, so it took a little getting used to. Hands are small so not all that easy for one handed use with my case. Love the speakers up front. Makes watching my shows on Netfilx that much more enjoyable. The UI is a little laggy at times, but that is compared to almost stock android on the Moto G. Compared to a friend's Samsung with TouchWiz, I get just a few less hangs up. The camera works for me (again, coming from that Moto G), but I have used much better (that Note 4 cam, wow!). I am truly impressed and would recommend it easily."
"Alcatel",3,"It's a good for the price tag. I really liked the battery life and all other aspect. The screen design makes it difficult to recommend this phone. Thin phone + 5.5 display is prone to CRACK!!! My idol3 screen cracked in regular usage and I'm no longer able to use the phone."
"Alcatel",1,"I am never one to write negative reviews but if I could give this piece of garbage a negative star rating I would. Please do not trust any of these reviews people. This garbage phone cant even handle the snapchat app. It repeatedly crashed and restarted because it couldn't even process a snapchat video and the audio from any video recording is laughably bad. Returned this and got a refurbished G3 for cheaper which blows this phone AWAY IN EVERY POSSIBLE CATEGORY AND FUNCTIONALITY. STAY AWAY FROM THIS GARBAGE!!!!!!!!!"
"Alcatel",5,"Awesome phone"
"Alcatel",5,"I'm no expert in smartphones , I'm only a common 4G user. This phone is very user-friendly! Love it!Fast, responsive, welbuilt, light weight, latest version of Android, and reasonably priced!Anyone who doesn't need a name brand to boost self-image, nor willing to pay top dollars twice the money, this one is highly recommeded.PS - in areas where signal is weak , it cannot handle surf and talk! But that's T-Moble's baby."
"Alcatel",4,"Its a cool little phone, i have been using it as my daily driver since June.Pros:Fits my hand wellGood DisplaySpeakers, Oh the speakersLightCons:Very soft plasticHas not updated to 5.1Power button for some is placed oddly , i have taken a lot of accidental screenshots.WiFi hasn't been great for me. Might be just my unit, don't let this scare you off.The camera is decent and I taken some good photos which i'll upload in a bit (UPDATE) can not upload from mobile. I wasn't lying about the speakers, they are great, 1.2 Watt JBL speakers, phones shouldn't be capable of the magnitude they are.If you'd like to see the camera at work, I made a video of still images I have taken with the the idol.[...]"
"Alcatel",1,"Horrible phone. It will look good for the first 3 months but then it comes up, dead pixels, broken audio, flimsy casing, etc. If you want to get a cheap good smart phone, get an older galaxy or iPhone... Horrible phone made to be good"
"Alcatel",4,"This phone is amazing, battery life last me all day, camera does it job well, and it performs well. My only issue is the lack of quality, out of the box the chrome ring was chipped up, but I let it go as it did not hinder the phone, but then the micro USB port went and now only two chargers I own (out of 5) work, the phone is destroying my cords, lastly I have five dead pixels on the screen. I've owned the phone for a few months and loved it but coming from budget HTC Desires I'm missing that sense of quality and durability. All and all tho it is a great buy at $250 and will finds its home in my pocket till the next big budget phone comes around."
"Alcatel",5,"Far more than I expected out of a phone in this price range. Honestly, this is probably my favorite phone that I've owned."
"Alcatel",3,"Decent phone for the money, but if you are used to flagships, prepare to embrace the lag. The UI lags severely even with hardly any apps running.Pros: - Screen. Very bright and colorful 1080p display. - Speakers. JBL audio working great. Plenty loud - MicroSD. Great to have. Allows apps natively installed to the card. Great feature with only 16 GB on board. - LTE. Grabbed LTE on ATT no problem.Cons - LAG. SOOO BAD! sent it back within a few hours of getting it. The Zenfone 2 blows it away in this category. - No fast charging. This might be able to be overlooked, but after having a Nexus 6 and the Zenfone, you get spoiled by it.Overall if you can deal with the lag and sluggishness, it's a great phone. I don't game on my phone as I have a tablet, which is why I tried this phone thinking it can do daily tasks fine but the UI lagging just got to me. I think the culprit is it only being clocked at 1.5 ghz, even the lower end zenfone @ $199 is 1.8 ghz. for $50 more, go with the Zenfone 2 with 4gb of ram and 64gb on board. Yea, the speaker sucks on the Zen, but the display is still pretty good and it runs so much better."
"Alcatel",1,"So far, I pretty much dislike this phone (""hate"" is too strong a word).All-in-all, I'm fairly unimpressed, and I don't understand the ""hype"" about this phone; last month when it was introduced, I even saw it featured on a local TV News segment. I suppose it's major draw is it's relative affordability compared to the Big Brand Name smartphones?CONS:I've been looking for WEEKS to find a complete User Manual because the manufacturer DOESN'T HAVE ONE. It seems that there are a lot of things/features/functions not covered in the Quick Start Guide.The battery life is unimpressive; my 3-and-a-half year old Samsung Note (the original, first generation Note) has the same battery life as this.Why the heck is the Ringtone/notification so FREAKING LOUD even at the lowest setting?!Why can you NEVER turn-off the vibrate/buzz regardless of turning it off in all the settings that give you the option of turning it off? You can either have the lowest (but pretty darn loud) volume set for ringing and notifications, or vibrate/buzz. There is no ""silent"". Silent = buzz.Even with the option of the LED Notification light, which is meant to preclude the use of buzz.PROS:Yes, the display/screen quality and resolution are very nice.The overall quality of the manufacturing is excellent and exactly like any of the Big Name Brand expensive phones (you cannot tell that it is a ""low-priced"" phone at all, it looks and feels great).I prefer big phones/phablets and find this phone is a nice size.I cannot comment on the JBL/Harmon sound; I have heard only ringtones and notification tones and buzzing, which seem the same quality as any modern, good-to-best-quality name brand smartphone.In fairness, some of the things I don't like I suspect are just my own fault for not learning Android 5/Lollipop completely yet - and maybe a lot of stuff I just really hate about Lollipop...But I'm comparing this to another family member's new phone that runs Lollipop and this Alcatel phone has some very weird and undesirable features/functions, and is missing some of the more desirable ones (for my uses).It could also very well be that this is simply not the right kind of Smartphone for me.I use my phones for Internet if needed when I'm not near a PC, messaging, the occasional actual phone call, and photos;never as a music player or for watching TV/movies/videos or as an eReader (that's what my massive LED HD TVs and tablets are for)."
"Alcatel",5,"Nice screen and front speakers. Nice look and design, I like it."
"Alcatel",5,"Speakers are great on this thing best speakers I heard in a cell phone. Camera looks great also has very good photos. No lagging that I can notice got in on the preorder price of $200 so its a steal for this unlocked phone. I never heard of Alcatel before and I absolutely love it."
"Alcatel",5,"Bought the phone for my daughter who is a teenager now. Nice phone and for this price, you don't need to worry about it too much.The phone itself is petty solid, and the performance is great."
"Alcatel",1,"its great phone for the price people, but the build quality is terrible in my experience. The edges where the speakers are have started to chip even with a case on it. i know you get what you pay for, but i wouldnt have expected the fake metal to peel so easily.UPDATE: i was contacted by alcatel two weeks ago through email they sent me a shipping label so i could exchange my handset for another one. I sent the phone back it arrived at their return location about a week ago. I ve tried contactig them numerous times through email and phone to try and find out information abiut my device. I spent and hour and half on hold and i didnt even speak to anyone. After this i contacted amazon and within an hour i already had a response, they helped me with this problem in less than hour. Thats why amazon is king. Will NEVER BUY ANYTHING FROM ALCATEL AGAIN."
"Alcatel",5,"Grate phone for the price. Only draw back battery can't be replaced. but still an excellent phone."
"Alcatel",4,"My first impressions for this phone is pretty good. I'm happy to see the amount of flagship phone qualities that this packs for under $300. I previously had the Samsung Galaxy S4 and I’m happy with the switch so far. I’m loving the 5.5 inch screen for browsing the web or watching videos although it’s going to take some time for me to adjust to the size of the phone. The dual facing front speakers are great, it’s much louder and clearer than the S4’s speaker. The near stock Android user interface was nice and smooth with some lag when opening up new applications. However, there are some problems that keeps this phone away from getting a 5 star rating. The power button is placed too high to operate without adjusting your hands and I thought that the double tap to power feature would help alleviate this problem but it doesn’t work most of the time when the screen is off. One more problem is the video recording quality looks low quality, during playback it’s like watching 360p or 480p videos that is scaled up to 1080p. These problems can probably be fixed with new updates, but until then I’ll leave the rating at a 4 star for now. Here are some other pros and cons.Pros:- Bright and clear display- Great dual front facing speakers- Pretty smooth user interface- Good reception (I had no issues connecting this phone with the AT&T network)- Camera takes decent pictures for the price- Slim body- Reversible screen and call featureCons:- Power button placement- Double tap power feature is unreliable at times (subject to change)- Poor quality 1080p video recording (subject to change)- Some lag when opening application- Lack of IR blaster- Non user replaceable battery- Radio feature gets terrible receptionOther note:- The phone call sound effect volume gradually gets lower when you call someone. I don’t know if this is intentional or a defective speaker. However, when the person answers their phone the volume seemed fine throughout the call."
"Alcatel",5,"Great phone, great price."
"Alcatel",5,"One of the better phones at price value to take advantage of T-Mobile's 700 MHz LTE."
"Alcatel",1,"I know this is not really so relevant now that the idol 4 has been released, but I feel it's my duty to tell you my experience with this device and also advice you to stay away from it and maybe even stay away from anything released by Alcatel! I bought 3 units of the idol 3 for me and my 2 brothers, I bought 2 of them in July 2015 and bought the third in Jan 2016.I bought them all from Amazon and had them shipped to me where I live in the Middle East.The phone was a bit laggy and had its problems, but hey you can't complain for $250! However, the lack of support was truly shameful, we were stuck in Android 5.0.2 for a really long time!Anyway that is not my problem here, my problem is that I think the idol 3 has huge manufacturing problem!Few weeks ago, my screen cracked right under the headphone jack, what made things worst is that I couldn't use the phone once the screen was cracked, because I thinks the digitizer is fused with the screen in this phone to make it thinner. I thought I somehow was the reason that the screen cracked, but guess what?! Yesterday my brother phone cracked too, In the right same spot where my phone cracked, right under the headphone jack! This can't be a coincidence! It's the exact same place, you can take a look at the images I attached to this review!so, I'm advising you to stay away from the Idol 3 and any other cheap products from Alcatel, including the Idol 4."
"Alcatel",4,"I love this phone but this phone started crashing on me here and there often but if alcatel can fix this again I would to purchase this again if there nothing happens like this again"
"Alcatel",1,"Dropped the phone from a height of about 2 and a half feet, the screen cracked in in upper left, not a huge crack but enough to be visible and also enough to completely break touch functionality for the entire screen. The phone had good performance and audio but there were often horrible slowdowns when typing (say for a google search or text) where I would have to wait for 30 seconds while the phone would catch up, sometimes the thing would just outright crash trying to catch up. Guess this phone is suffering from a memory leak or just can't handle typing...Another unfortunate issue is the availability of decent phone cases. The only ones I found at the time of purchase were terrible and cheap feeling, with absolutely horrible buttons. Ended up throwing out my case and this is what I get."
"Alcatel",3,"I bought this phone about a year ago and was initially very happy. Since the most recent update, however, it is slow and at times will not read my SIM card. As in, I'll be in the middle of a conversation and the call drops, I look at my screen, and it says ""No SIM card installed."" The touch screen has also gotten buggy; sometimes, you have to beat it half to death to get it to engage, other times, it calls people when something inside my purse first turns it on and then brushes against the screen. Bizarre.Having said all of this, I am on TMobile, so some of these issues may be related to the recent removal of band 12 compatibility. I definitely notice a huge drop in the call quality since the most recent update, to the point that I want to throttle the thing out the window. Even with a headset (I have tried 4 different ones), people on the other end complain that they can't hear me.As to the screen being fragile, that has not been my experience. I have dropped the phone many, many times (often onto a concrete floor) and it hasn't broken, and I haven't noticed any scratching on the screen. I don't have any kind of case on it and it swims around in my purse unprotected, so there's that.I think this is probably a really good phone for the money -- if you're not on TMobile. I really enjoyed it initially and felt a little smug that I had gotten such a great phone for such a low price. I am buying something else, though, because I've lost patience with the call quality and other strange bugginess since the update."
"Alcatel",4,"Seemed like a great buy at the time. Having owned it for a while now I see 4 major shortcomings:1. Useless as an alarm clock. Completely unreliable. Sometimes goes off at the right time. Many times does not. Takes away half the functionality.2. OS will not grant many apps write permissions to the SD card. The app will ask for it, send you to a system screen, and the system screen won't show the SD card. I call support and they say it's the app's fault (these are apps downloaded tens of millions times like rocket player and ES file browser). They say, with a straight face, that I should only use the stock apps they provide. I was stunned.3. As pretty as the big screen is, it is NOT healthy for my eyes. I was hoping to read more on it. I have stopped doing that. No sub for a good screen (eg of a decent size tablet) for comfortable reading.4. Likely will be stuck on Lollipop 5.0.2 forever. Not even 5.1.1. Very disappointing.Would not recommend.Late edit: After upgrading to Android Marshmallow problems 1,2 and 4 went away. Thanks for updating, Alcatel.Now it's a nice, cheap, (slowish), big, reliable smart phone. I'm happy.Hope this phone lives to see Android N."
"Alcatel",2,"Battery life no good"
"Alcatel",5,"Wow! What a gem!! My old Samsung S4 died after many years of faithful service so I looked into getting the latest and greatest Samsung. The price of a new S7 immediately had me searching for ""best cheap android phones"". I came across this Alcatel OneTouch Idol 3 and bought it. NO REGRETS! The size is perfect for what I was looking for. I was able to sync the applications that I wanted back to this new phone. Performance is acceptable and the price is exceptional. The camera is not the best, however for what I need, it is more than what is required. I highly recommend this for anyone who would like to get a nicely appointed phone and not feel like you are getting robbed."
"Alcatel",5,"UPDATE:I installed the new Marshmallow update yesterday and OH MY GOD is it smooth. It's has so much less lag it's like I have a new phone!Unfortunately updating to Marshmallow removed the ability to use T-Mobile Band 12 LTE (you still get LTE on other bands) which you can't change unless you Root your phone and flash the previous radio software. But I think it's 100% worth the trade off. Get this phone now! If mine breaks I think I'll get another, no joke.----------------------First off this is the most beautiful phone I've ever owned and the speakers and screen are to die for.But the processor/RAM/internal memory/software leave a lot to be desired. It's soooo slow at times, and I usually can't have more than a few apps open at once if I want it to work at all. I'm only keeping it because I love the speakers and I'm gonna be getting the IDOL 4S when it comes out because it has specs I have been wanting for 2 years.Everything I mentioned as a downside are improved in the 4S, double the internal memory, 3GB RAM, SD 652 processor which is better than the SD 808!!! And newer software of course.I just hope I can sell the idol 3 for $100 to put towards the new one. I still think this isn't a bad phone for under $200, especially if you love good front facing speakers. but I hate how slow it is."
"Alcatel",5,"Husband loves his new phone"
"Alcatel",1,"False Advertising! T-Mobile Users Beware! I purchased two of these phones (The first in June 2015 from Amazon and the second one in Sep 2015 directly from Alcatel who used Amazon to fulfill the order). My Primary reason for the purchases was support for T-Mobile Band 12 and the price point. Well, for the last couple of months, the signal quality has been noticeably worse,...missing calls, texts etc. I tried to think back to what changed and I remembered an OTA update in Janurary from Alcatel. After some research, I discovered that Alcatel's Janurary OTA firmware update REMOVED support for T-Mobile band 12! They actually took away the feature that was my primary reason for purchase. No warnings, no communications. It was done secretly and now I have two phones that perform very poorly. When I contacted them their response was basically ""Screw you...too bad."" I have read they have no plans to update it and make it work. It's bringing your new car to the dealer for an oil change and them removing your transmission without telling you leaving you with a useless hunk of metal. Shame on you Alcatel/TCL and Amazon! I would hope that you would make this right somehow, but not holding my breath."
"Alcatel",5,"let me just say, this has been one of the best phone that i have gotten. it's not fast, but its really good as a daily driver,camera works great, love using timelapse. front facing camera is also great for selfies.battery life is great too, would last a whole day (unless i kept on making timelapse videos).i got this because my moto x 2014 malfunction and i have to send it back to motorola, i'm pretty sure i'm gonna go back to using that one but i would still be using this as my backup phone/multimedia player/camerareason for that being, it has really good audio, watching videos & listening to music the sound is just awesome."
"Alcatel",4,"Arrived two days early. Great buy so far, still need to take photos. Good battery life on SB. No option to turn off swipe to open. Needs slim case, very slippery."
"Alcatel",4,"Switched from a OnePlus One. Is it worth the switch? depends. This is a good mid-range phone. Main reason why I switched phones is because this phone supports band 2, 4, and 12 on T-Mobile's LTE network. Where as the OnePlus One only supports band 4. Although the OnePlus One's performance is better, it does have bug issues with both Cyanogen 12 (CM12), and their Oxygen OS versions of Android 5 Lollipop. Plus, people on the other end were complaining they can't hear me clearly.Pros:- Good screen quality (Bright)- Good sound quality (with JBL dual front facing speakers)- Plastic build does not feel cheap. Has nice ""brushed"" effect- Band 2, 4, and 12 support on T-Mobile's LTE Network- Battery lasts whole day- Expandable storage with MicroSD card up to 128GB- 13MP back, 8MP front camera- Reversible- Decent quality earbuds included- Good call quality, other person can hear me clearly- $249 priceCons:- Screen quality is on the bright side. It doesn't get dark enough when turned all the way down. (had to use a screen filter app to make the screen dimmer than the lowest setting)- Camera sound/mic quality is not good.- Performance issues (can lag and freeze with certain apps. Its a software issue. Alcatel has sent out an update which helped it a little, but it still has not been completely resolved. Hoping Alcatel will send out another update soon. SnapChat has noticeable performance issues. The SnapDragon 615 has enough power to handle the performance, since lower ranged phones can handle SnapChat with no issues.)- Alcatel's light skin over Android Lollipop is ok, but it would be better if they left it stock Android."
"Alcatel",5,"so far so good .had a problem with the screen going off when during a phone call..so i couldn't hang up...turned out the proximity sensor had dust in it and needed blown out(earphone jack) and if you open too many apps then try to music from the sd card it will studder..but all in all works for the most part."
"Alcatel",5,"Great phone for great price! You get an awesome 5.5 inch display, crisp loud front facing jbl speakers, free quality jbl ear buds and a fast phone that can easily rival the Samsung Galaxy S5! I received my phone this morning and simply can't put it down! I sat my wife next to me so we can enjoy this beauty together lol...the front facing speakers really make a difference. I doubt I'll ever go back to a back facing speakers phone. Alcatel really did us all a favor with this awesome beast! Can't beat it for the price!"
"Alcatel",5,"I love this phone so much. As a former alcatel oneouch S pop owner, I was kind of unsure if this was the phone for me (as it had stopped working). But after watching and reading countless reviews, I said why not? and can i say best decision of my life! I had a budget of $250 so it was right on the budget but has awesome quality. I was so surprised! Not only does it have the newest form of android (lollipop) but really cool features like the reversible feature. It also has great icons and the screen quality is great. There is a JBU mix feature that has this dj mixing feature which was cool. On all the reviews I watched everyone complained about lag, I played about 15 levels of cooking fever and it didn't stutter once. The phone is also really light weight even though is waay bigger than my onetouch S pop it is still much lighter. It also has a good camera, both front and back. Awesome phone and awesome price."
"Alcatel",5,"I’m not going to get into too many explicit specs on the phone because I am trying to review this from a real-world, does-it-work? perspective. I don’t care about benchmarks, I care about how I was able to use this phone in my everyday life. If you want every technical detail, you can go here.Hardware/ScreenThe Idol is a 5.5 inch phone with a 1080p IPS screen. The back of the phone has a plastic back, but not removable (so no battery swapping). There are some faux-chrome accents that go around the device and the speakers (dual-front facing, more on that later) are at the very tippy-top and bottom of the phone. The phone feels pretty nice in the hand and wasn’t hard to hold.The screen is fantastic and one of the best features of the phone. Alcatel uses some buzz-words to describe it (TECHNICOLOR!) but the simplest way to put it is that the screen is vivid, bright and crystal clear. It’s not flagship level for 2015, that would require a QHD screen, but what it lacks in resolution vs. something like the LG G4 or Samsung Galaxy S6, it makes up for by being $300+ cheaper (off contract) than any other flagship device. Simply put, the Idol’s screen is so nice, it doesn’t feel like it should be on a phone so cheap.My other favorite hardware feature is the inclusion of a MircoSD slot next to the sim card slot (which are both in a tray that’s ejected from the left side of the phone). I basically can’t buy a phone without extra storage because I prefer to keep as much music downloaded to my phone as I can, to avoid streaming (either due to data restrictions or having access to it when I am in areas with poor coverage). The storage is up-gradable to 128gb, which goes on top of the 16gb the phone offers out of the gate (almost 10gb usable out of the box).Sound QualityThe quality of sound I get from a smartphone is critical to me. I’d say I place listening to music/podcasts as the number one use I have for a smartphone. My HTC One has audio tuned by Beats, which then morphed into Boomsound, but whatever you want to call it, it sounds great coming from the device or listening via headphones.I’m happy to say that the sound quality is another feature here that seems like it would come from a more expensive phone. Here, Alcatel touts sound tuned by JBL with an option to turn that sound optimization on or off under the settings. I much prefer the sound with the feature on and I’d say it easily rivaled my HTC One for sound quality both when listening from the device or with headphones.There’s a speaker on the top and bottom of the phone, which is, in part, necessary for their upside-down feature. Basically, you can pick up the phone for a call and it will be properly orientated regardless of it being right side up or not. I don’t find the feature to be something that was of great use to me, but I can see the function.Regardless of that feature, having two speakers on the phone is part of what makes it sound great. Some newer phones, like the Asus Zenfone 2 have what looks like dual front speakers, but in reality only one speaker is at the top or the bottom. The Idol gets LOUD when listening from the device. Louder than my One. I love this feature because it makes for listening to music or podcasts in the shower nice and easy to hear. The speakers don’t even seem to become over-burdened when at full volume.Sound quality is on par with the screen, giving the Idol 2 features that feel to be of much better quality that you’d expect from a phone in this price range.UsabilityAndroid Lollipop comes standard (I think I had 5.0 out of the gate) and is near stock. Most of the non-stock features are removable. I’ve grown to love stock Android vs. any skinned version of it, so that was a determining factor for me with the Idol.The general, day-to-day use of the Idol is perfectly adequate, but not overwhelmingly speedy. This was the first part of the phone that felt like “you get what you pay for”. That’s not to say it’s not functional, because it very much so is. Where as I found the lack of speed to be a factor in selling my Moto G, I had no such thoughts with the Idol.There are no issues with multi-tasking, I was easily able to switch between music, maps, a browser and a game. Things like that are just a bit pokey to respond. Not pokey in the sense that it takes 30 seconds of your life from you, but sometimes a program might take 1 or 2 seconds longer to open than you’d see on a phone with a top-of-the-line processor/RAM setup. Those 1 to 2 seconds seem annoying sometimes, but that just speaks to me and my lack of patience. The reality is that this phone works perfectly well and should for the vast majority of users.Call quality is perfectly adequate, but I am probably not someone who should even speak to that. I spend, maybe, 10 minutes a week using my smartphone as an actual phone, but those 10 minutes work very well. I come across clearly as does the person on the other end. The speakerphone has the benefit of the dual speakers, just as a song or podcast does.I feel like the hardware buttons would have been nicer if placed a littler lower. Due to the phone’s size, I had issues with pressing the unlock button with one hand. Not massive issues, since I’ve almost always used two hands with my phone, but for people who like a one hand device, this might not be it (if I’m being honest, I think this is a stupid reason to or not to buy a phone, I tend to just adapt to whatever device I select, but to each their own). The USB port and headphone jack are where you’d expect them, on the bottom and top, respectively.Battery LifeAnother nice feature with the phone is battery life. I don’t consider myself a super heavy user of screen time on a basic day, so I’d easily get home with 50+% after work and make it to bed with 30+% or more. Having the phone on a recent vacation where I was heavy on camera use and GPS I found myself slightly more nervous with battery life, but the phone charges very quickly (60% in 40 minutes, I think) so driving 10 minutes from one place to another, I could give a quick boost and take that nervousness away. Overall, very solid battery life for my (and I think most people’s) usage.CameraHere we get a 13MP rear-facing camera with a 8MP front-facing camera for selfies. All in all, I was very happy with the camera performance. In well lit situations, shots where clear and crisp. Some low-light situations mad for poorer quality pictures, but that’s every camera phone, ever. The biggest struggle for the camera was actually on a cloudy day. I used the camera’s time-lapse video function to film a boat trip I took on Lake Superior and you can see that the phone struggles with it’s focus and makes the land look rather dark against the cloudy sky. This could be user error, however, I’m not sure.Like every other smartphone out there, there’s an HDR function in the menu to give a little more definition to your shots. I think it worked as well as one would expect, but I stuck with the camera’s auto mode for the most part. Check out this gallery here, here and here to see some shots in all sorts of lighting conditions.Other than having the sun blare straight into the camera lens or overly dark shots, I really liked what the camera gave me. Anything I see as a negative with the camera is just the reality of using a smartphone for your main camera due to convenience. They are never going to perform like the best point-and-shoot units, but to have decent performance is nice and the Idol is a step or two above decent.Final VerdictI don’t think you can get this much phone for the money you pay, anywhere else. The Idol is, very easily, worth the extra $70 you’d be spending over a Moto G. The other phone that was hot in the running for me was the Asus Zenfone 2 (4GB Ram Version) but I picked the Idol for its superior sound quality and screen, both of which I think are better than the Asus. I know that OnePlus has their 1’s at a lower cost right now, but the lack of a Mirco SD card took them out of the running for me, I keep a lot of music on my phone.Overall, there is a trade-off between these less expensive, off-contract phones. OnePlus and Asus focused on making a very responsive, powerful phone and Alcatel focused on a better media experience. I don’t think you can go wrong with any of those three options, but the Idol Onetouch 3 was easily the phone for me….…and I miss it. As I alluded to earlier, I am back to my HTC One. I got a little to into my desire to become Ansel Adams that I may or may not have dropped the Idol in a river in Northern Wisconsin. I’d love to get another Idol, but it’s not currently in the budget and I DO have a phone that works, even if I can’t update it. I plan to wait out until next year to see what the Onetouch 4 will bring. Alcatel made a statement with this device and I hope to see them continue making phones at a budget price with specs and usability that outweigh the budget price point."
"Alcatel",5,"Awesome phone!!!!!! A High end phone for the price of a budget one with Great specs!!!!!"
"Alcatel",5,"Wow, I am blown away by the quality at this price! Only thing i noticed missing was wireless charging and Qualcomm 2.0 turbo charging capabilities. But other than that its great, didn't notice any lag unless i was closing a large amount of apps at once. Looking at my Nexus 6 that is about three times more expensive, I feel pretty impressed with this phone. Same stereo front facing speakers, and they sound great. The FM radio is a nice inclusion, wish more phones had this. JBL headphones are nice sound good, and was clearly heard during a phone call. Double tap to wake screen work very well, wish my Nexus 6 had this. It has a very premium feel and screen looks brighter and more vivid than my Nexus 6. I guess you can tell why I'm so impressed with the price tag, It's very close to quality as my Nexus 6, at least in my personal opinion."
"Alcatel",1,"I loved this phone until I found out that I CANNOT USE GOOGLE VOICE properly. When making calls the dialer will not go through Google Voice, regardless of settings. After researching online I have found that this is known issue with Alcatel that has not been resolved. This is a deal breaker for me. An Android phone that won't allow Google Voice to function properly is simply unacceptable."
"Alcatel",5,"Best phone in the world for the price!"
"Alcatel",4,"Good phone, great price."
"Alcatel",5,"Good phone"
"Alcatel",5,"Bought it as a gift from a relative. He loves its there is direct feedback from him1. Light Weight2. Fit well in the pocket3. Batter last really well."
"Alcatel",5,"I am an iPhone freak. I was looking to add another phone(a moderately priced one as it'll only serve as my iPhone's 'assistant') with a different OS from apple's iOS. A phone with the android OS was my preferred choice. I gave up on my search because I didn't get what I needed in a moderately priced android phone till I saw a friend with the 4.7 inch version of the idol 3. I browsed through and was like 'whaaat, Alcatel did this'? The phone fast, has a good camera, has good speakers and good battery life, because after about 30 minutes of watching videos, the battery didn't drain as it would've on my iPhone 6. I bought one of the 4.7 for my personal use due to its cute size and 4 of the 5.5 to sell. In my country, bigger screen phones sells faster, plus the 5.5 is the better of the two in terms of performance. It's been about a year now and none of the buyers has called to complain about anything. A special someone needs an android OS phone and the only phone that came to mind was the idol 3, my reason for buying again. We had an issue before I received the phone. I am waiting till the issue is resolved before presenting the phone. She'll love it(because she's always praised mine every time she's played with it), and even more because this screen size bigger than mine."
"Alcatel",1,"haven't ever experienced terrible phone like this.it does not touch well. I have to click more than one time.one day i found that all the app data gone. I had to log in all the apps, and change the settings in each app.it works slow just like snapdragon 400 series"
"Alcatel",5,"I was really surprised on how well it works"
"Alcatel",4,"I hate smartphones. Only the need for an unlocked device persuaded me to sup with the devil. I long for a simple flip-phone. OK this phartsmone seems to be very acceptable. Once I figured out how to answer a phone call I was very happy. What I cannot shake is the feeling that all these icon things are sucking my PAYG airtime into a black hole. So I keep it turned off - that defeats the gremlins! Should you buy this phone? I'd say it does the job that you would expect of a more expensive unit and it's worth the money. I transitioned from the USA to South Africa and it's fine. I'm not fond of micro-sims for SA because the USB modems for my laptop take full size sims and I don't want to access the internet from a phone, dammit. I hate it. But you'll like it because you are not old and crotchety like me."
"Alcatel",5,"Fast shipping,good phone"
"Alcatel",5,"Mobile is excellent and I bought it for my wife and she liked it a lot.."
"Alcatel",3,"Just received my new Alcatel one touch idol 3 and was happy with it for about an hour until I tried taking a video and during playback the audio was muffled and cut in and out because microphones don't pick up noises that are on the quite side. I think it has a background noise cancelling feature built into the microphone but they cut out to much noise and there's no option to adjust sensitivity, or they just put crappy microphones in the phone to cut cost. Other than that everything else was good about the phone but the bad microphones were a deal breaker for me, I sent mine back."
"Alcatel",5,"Great speaker loud and clear,best sound ever. Camera is great pictures are clear day or night. Easy to use!"
"Alcatel",5,"Excellent"
"Alcatel",5,"This phone sounds great! It's the only phone I can stand to use the speakerphone. I bought this phone for my wife, and she loves it."
"Alcatel",1,"Slow and dead at 14 months. I liked the bright screen and the sound but it no longer works."
"Alcatel",4,"Good sized phone with no connection issues. The price is not too high for anyone looking for something with an HD screen."
"Alcatel",5,"I have had this phone for almost a week. Not one problem. Other than a few lags here and there. A great phone for a unheard of price. I paid $150 for this phone and it runs and feels like a $800 flagship phone. Only down side is I wish it had 4 Gigabyte's of RAM and not the 2 Gigabyte's."
"Alcatel",1,"Phone suffered a screen crack riding in my pocket for 5 minutes while driving 2 months after being purchased. Not very durable. I would not buy it again."
"Alcatel",5,"Very good phone"
"Alcatel",5,"Great phone, great service, and fast. Really great music and headphones."
"Alcatel",5,"I love this phone for the price! This is my 4th Android phone over many years and by far the best yet. The screen is great, the sound is way better than any phone I've heard and the camera... it's no DSLR but hey, what do you expect for a phone? If you're expecting an iPhone 6s+ here, you may be disappointed. But for what most people use a phone for: Phone calls, check email or Facebook, look up something on the web, take a picture, it's just fine.I don't play games on this so I can't speak for the performance in that department. My guess is that you would want something a little more zippy if you're using graphics intensive apps.I have not experienced any issues with listening to audio (Pandora, PowerAmp, Google Music, Dogcatcher) or the bluetooth connection as some of the reviews may lead you to believe. I listen to music and podcasts using bluetooth to my car and a few pairs of bluetooth headsets with no stuttering or frequent dropouts. Audio quality is great over BT.The phone is updated regularly by Alcatel.Hate to say it, but sometimes things don't work out of the box. Sorry to hear that the customer service isn't great but again, you're more than welcome to spend $800 for an iPhone or Samsung if you want the best experience possible. I'll take my chances and save a bunch of cash, thank you! Going on 4 months with no issues on this one. Oh, if you're going to drop any phone, get a case! Just saying."
"Alcatel",5,"Its been more then 6 months i am using this mobile . i liked it. Perfect size , for watching video on go and reading books. Awesome sound quality by the way i love JBL sound mixer app Camera quality is really good Battery Life is good and charge pretty fast with its own charger. All in all i like this mobile"
"Alcatel",2,"Great phone. But where can I find a screen?"
"Alcatel",5,"Only wished it was dual sim."
"Alcatel",5,"Excelent smartphone. Affordable. Fast. 100% recommended."
"Alcatel",5,"Excellent mid price phone. Has met all of my expectations. The screen and two front speakers are beyond great."
"Alcatel",5,"The Idol 3 smartphone is so thin and light that, despite its large 4.7"" diagonal screen, it doesn't feel any bulkier in my bluejeans pocket than my 5-year-old prior smartphone did, Great job."
"Alcatel",2,"i have owned this device for two months and the left top corner of the device is cracked already just from carryng in my pocket and 1/2 bottom of the screen is not working anymore i dont know what to do... if you go to another forums like XDA you'll see that im not the only one having issues with this device a ton of people had the same exact problem, i feel sad because is a great phone but unfortunately is made from really cheap materials i would recomend to save a little more money and get another device rather than this..."
"Alcatel",5,"Amazing phone! For $250 it compares if not out does my friends galaxy s6."
"Alcatel",1,"I bought this phone for my daughter last June 14th and 90 days later, September 16th the phone is dead, no scratches or ding on the phone, nothing. It looks new because from day one it had hard case and film protector. Amazon warranty is over so my daughter called Alcatel almost 10 times to obtain the RMA, to send the phone to get checked and repaired. I like to know why a new phone dies after only 90 days? Nice apologize by Alcatel, but they have yet to send the promised email containing the return label, only providing excuses stating that they ""understand our frustration"". We need solution not excuses. It should be replaced by Alcatel, as it is truly a defective product, not just repaired.Summary: Phone died after only 90 days, Alcatel customer service has been sub-par, promising to provide a shipping label to get the phone repaired but never actually sending it. Don't waste your money with this phone."
"Alcatel",5,"Excellent phone"
"Alcatel",5,"I'm all for using my money wisely did a lot of research and this phone does everything I need and more! I am a heavy phone user, this phone this its job. AT&T is my phone carrier I had the option for an upgrade through them but they have this new program where you rent phones for a monthly fee and if you bought a phone outright FROM THEM it would bring in another fee. Basically they want you to rent the phones now. I went to play C and bought this phone so i could save money in the long run."
"Alcatel",4,"Regular case for impact"
"Alcatel",5,"You simply can beat the price!.I really love the way this smartphone looks. Both the screen and the audio are the best part!."
"Alcatel",3,"I had a great hope for this product.This phone is far better than other phones in the same range, But after using this for a month I am bit disappointed. Here is my experience with this mobile.Good:> Nice screen. The screen is clearly visible in sunlight. Dont be fooled by other phones with great specs. This screen works.> Good battery life. With casual usage ( net, calling, youtube, small games, text ) this phone lasted for more than a day for me.> Awesome sound quality. With dual JBL speakers and headphones. The sound is just awesome. Call quality is also clear.OK:> Ergonomics is OK. With this screen size, holding the phone is bit difficult to hold and they have not provided any special software ( like asus zenphone ) to make it easy.> software. Pure android for most of the part.Bad:> Performance.Dont be fooled by 2GB ram and quad core CPU. This phone is laggy. its the deal breaker.> Camera: The autofocus of the camera is useless. By the time you click , the lens looses its focus and the image is blurry. Same with video.Terrible.>Software: Not much customization offered. Too little.Conclusion: With oneplus one and many other mobiles offering better specs and better performance this mobile is not a good choice to go at this point in time."
"Alcatel",5,"Im absolutely amazed with the sound of the speakers, I have an HTC m8 and JBL speakers from the idol sounds for me louder and better. It's a great phone for its price, the only thing that kind of dissaponted me was the camera resolution at low light or dark spaces it is just not good compared to my HTC camera. But overall happy with the purchase , I bought a second idol 3 phone after the first one cause it really worth it. Also double tap doesn't react so quick, as my HTC m8 but it's no big deal. Other thing I loved about the idol is the reverse screen. And the headphones JBL, just great add for this great phone.I'm an HTC user telling that this phone is nearly a high end class phone , it looks, feels,sounds just amazing. And battery life no worries you can end your day of usage and go home at night to charge it.Fully recommended."
"Alcatel",1,"Horribleeee experience with this cell phone... i bought the first one through amazon and it came used (i ordered a new one). then i tried ordering it through alcatel webpage and it came defective!! the color in the screens were all wrong. horrible brand."
"Alcatel",5,"So far very good!"
"Alcatel",5,"Great phone and great price"
"Alcatel",5,"Nice smartphone for reasonable price. Not the best performance but the dual JBL speakers are really loud and phone has a nice design.I have been using it for 2 months and one of my family member likes it so much, I ended up buying a second one for them."
"Alcatel",5,"The phone is great,the earplugs good stereo sound but the male insert for the phone charger too small-falls out ."
"Alcatel",5,"I was sceptical at first despite the reviews and after owning one i am anxious for the model. I love this phone."
"Alcatel",5,"I love this phone more and more. It has 16gb memory that is bogged down with tons of preloaded apps so I haven't even needed to use the SD memory yet. It is a slim, nice looking phone. It's camera works pretty well with my only complaint being how dark videos are in dim light. Its dual front facing speakers are loud and clear and I love that they face you when watching videos. I have cricket and have had no dropped calls with it so far. And above all it was such a reasonable price for everything considered."
"Alcatel",2,"The camera on this was terrible. For a 13 MP camera, the colors in the pics were washed out and many of them were shaky, I suppose that's where the lack of image stabilization comes into play, especially with indoor photos. And the 8MP front facing camera when used indoors had so much noise I was simply shocked at the result. Black or shadowy areas were full of noise and even lighted spaces were fuzzy. My Samsung's 2.1 MP front camera outperformed the Idol 3 which was very surprising.In outside lighting the camera was merely decent, but some backgrounds would be washed out. Playing with the exposure helped some, but simply not enough. I also read that perhaps you could download a different camera app that would help with the faded issue, but that really shouldn't be necessary for a 13 MP camera. Also many tech reviews about the camera were positive, so either I had a faulty device or my standards are just way too high.I was really disappointed since the phone itself was very nice and had some nice features that I didn't really get to explore. Anyhow, I sent it back. I ended up biting the bullet and laying down the cash for the LG G5."
"Alcatel",5,"Strongly recommend it. The only downside if I will criticize it is , it doesn't support wi-fi calling."
"Alcatel",1,"I couldn't even call on the phone, it said the phone was stolen. 😑"
"Alcatel",4,"The phone is alright. It actually is very responsive and definitely worth the money. Only thing is, I'm a beefy user which means I download a lot of apps.This phone can handle it but that paired with my 4000 photos and 30 videos makes the experience a bit difficult to enjoy.Overall if you don't have my situation then you'll be fine. This phone can power through the everyday tasks with a breeze. Doesn't lag. Unless you have my situation.Battery life in my situation will last me about 3 hours. Without my situation it has lasted about 12 hours. With heavy usage were talking 8 hours. Not bad for a budget phone that won best phones of 2015 on CES for the best budget phones.The screen is awesome! Full HD and fully reversible. I have picked up my phone upsidedown taking it out my pocket or just picking it up off table or bed. Very useful feature.I have had the phone for about 3 months. Still is in good condition. The screen doesn't scratch easily. The phone looks of high quality.The speakers are super loud and very clear. It is HiFi qualito ( Google it if you don't know what it means). They are JBL speakers and there are two on the front discreetly placed.If you're looking for a budget phone that can handle a 128gb SD card and has a great screen with a price point under 200 then this is the phone."
"Alcatel",2,"Phone cracks very easily, after first crack the bottom half stopped working. The first 4 days I had it the speakers didnt work so I had to factory reset it. Other than those problems, I really like the phone. Gets what I need done and the camera was great when I could use it."
"Alcatel",3,"Love the sound and the pictures. Would give 5 stars, but got it to connect to my 2017 Elantra and it keeps saying my device doesn't have media. I've had it a month. Can't find the right info/person to fix the problems. It also doesn't connect to the photo kiosk at Rite Aid. It seems to have great specs. Just can't use it for what I bought it for. I feel like it shouldn't have these problems. My car rep told me it's because I use Tracfone instead of a major company like At&t or Verizon. I don't get it and have put so much time into figuring these issues out, I'm frustrated.If anyone can help, please let me know. Love the phone, just want it to connect and work."
"Alcatel",5,"So far so good. Very easy to set up on AT&T."
"Alcatel",1,"Amazon would not let me post my true review. :(This phone is no longer working properly after 30 days of use. Amazon will not refund the purchase price. I should be refunded the purchase price due to the product being defective. Blue screen comes on and off and does not stay connected to the Internet. I purchased two because they were cheap @ $99.99 ea. However, only one works.Filing claim with credit card company now!"
"Alcatel",5,"Incredible phone for the price. It has many features that no other phone has at this price point,NFC,good JBL stereo speakers and earbuds.It has a nice display 1080 p and it upgraded to Marshmallow 6.0 right away. An awesome phone for a great price. The best low price phone that I know of."
"Alcatel",2,"I've had this phone for 7 months and on almost a daily basis, I exclaim ""I hate this phone"". I've had midrange phones before and really liked the Asus Zenfone. But the idol 3 is very slow, locks up a lot, has a lot of missing functionality that just seems like 'I can't believe you can't do that on this phone' kinda stuff. Also I was expecting a lot from the dual speakers and have been very disappointed in the sound and loudness of them. The camera is pretty dreadful, just terrible pictures and the video recorder is awful in terms of functionality. I think I'll go back to Asus when I can justify buying a new phone. Maybe I'll accidentally drop this one on concrete."
"Alcatel",5,"a+"
"Alcatel",4,"Very good value for the price, couldn't for more for a $100 phone."
"Alcatel",2,"Bought for $132 phone design is horrible. SD and sim card slot breaks after taking it out one time. Go look at videos for installing a sim on this phone its a joke. The battery is not removable. The screen shows every finger mark. Its slow and the camera is not good either. The only thing good is that it has a full HD resolution (1080), and a large screen. The customer service for Alcatel is disgusting. The guy I was chatting to just simply ignored me, and when I tried to connect to someone who would help me it just kept redirecting me to the same guy. This phone is worth no more than $100. Overall disappointed."
"Alcatel",5,"Its a good Phone for the price, I am absolutly happy with it"
"Alcatel",1,"Asked for refund product not working"
"Alcatel",5,"What can you say, it is made in China and that means GOOD REAL GOOD to me.I have several others and they are all excellent.I travel to China on vacation and I use a China Mobile Simm, no problems. GREAT PHONE.Uses AT&T and is really 4G LTE and it works great and in China is also excellent!!!!!!!"
"Alcatel",5,"Love It"
"Alcatel",5,"Bought 2x @ $199.99 pre-order price, best deal for a flagship phone. Gave them as birthday gifts to my daughters. They love it!!! Screen is bright & sharp, dual front speakers are loud and clear, both front and rear cams take good/clear pictures. Phone works great on AT&T LTE network, connection is fast for data (Youtube streaming, FB, snapchat, browsing, etc) and battery lasts all day!!! Only cons are it doesn't come with pre-installed screen protector & soft clear case (like from BLU).Overall, still 5-star rating ..."
"Alcatel",5,"My only gripe is the knock knock feature which sometimes doesn't work. It goes hand in hand with the reverse feature of the phone. Hopefully an update is coming soon as Alcatel now sees what problems people are experiencing.I'm getting great reception on Cricket. Battery life is amazing and the screen looks really good. Not to mention how light and thin it is. I can hold it with just a couple of fingers for a while without getting tired. I don't see much lag that some others are experiencing. This thing probably has the best speakers on a phone. I now sometimes don't even have to use my bluetooth speaker."
"Alcatel",5,"Got this to replace my Galaxy S3 and I couldn't have found a better phone on my budget! Its way faster than the previous and it has an updated software! Its a gorgeous phone and worth the wait!"
"Alcatel",3,"This is the second alcaltel phone that I have purchased. The first was alcaltel fierce. This phone is so much better than that one. I viewed all the reviews and read all the information before purchasing the idol 3. I guess I had high expectations for this phone. After using it for a short time I felt dissatisfied with the idol 3. I felt it wasn't as good as my old phone an huawei acsend mate 2. Bottom line if I could of tried it out for a day before purchasing it would I still have bought it? I can honestly say no I wouldn't have purchased it. Is this phone a flagship killer? In my opinion no alcaltel needs to polish there product and try a little harder on there next phone."
"Alcatel",4,"I got this at the current price of $250, which is still a good deal for what you get. As a T-Mobile customer, I wanted a phone that supports all the T-Mobile bands (since T-mobile coverage is not all that great as it is), which is what set this apart from the Zenfone 2. I really like the phone so far.Double tap to wake has worked for me every time. Some people have reported it not working for them all the time. It works best with the launcher it came with, so if you are using some thing else like the Nova launcher, it may not work without additional tweaks. Also remember that it needs a tap, not a gentle touch, so bend your fingers when you tap.Camera seems okay so far. Some have commented about the lack of a link to Gallery. The access to Gallery is still there. It is a little different going from Android 4 to Android 5. In 5, after you take a picture, you need to swipe from right to left to review the picture you just took. If you swipe again, you can see the previous pictures you took from Gallery.I recommend using Firefox as the browser and install an add-on like adblock to make it a little easier on the phone since the CPU in this is not the top-tier workhorse the more expensive flagship phones use."
"Alcatel",5,"It's amazing for the price. Sure it isn't as fast as flagship phones being an owner of an m9, but for what I payed it's a 5/5."
"Alcatel",5,"About as good value for money as there is on the current market. Lacks only a high-end processor (only important if you play demanding video games- I don't play any), and a few of those unnecessary ""features"" the big boys like to promote, to be equal to current flagships at almost 3x the price. Has all frequencies for AT&T and T Mobile, including LTE band 12 for the latter (which few other unlocked phones have at this point). Build quality is very good and the display is gorgeous. If you want a phablet don't even think twice, just buy it."
"Alcatel",4,"For the price that the phone costs you definitely get much more than you pay for, but if you can afford to spend more, then this phone is not for you. I've had pretty much most flagship phones out there.I will start with what I dislike about the phone. 1)The lag does get annoying, but then again it is exactly the same lag that I had while using Note 4. Even galaxy s6 edge has one. I have to use those cleaning apps to free up so space in order to boost the performance. I also disabled animations in the developer mode. Still after all that, the lag is there. It is noticeable during typing when it becomes slow and keys don't register right away. 2)Next thing is battery, dies pretty quick, but even though there is no quick charge, it does charge pretty fast, on park with s6 and note 4. Battery also gets hot when using the phone with having few apps open in the background. 3) Knock knock feature doesn't work most of the time.So So things.1)Display is a hit or miss type of a thing. Colors are not as vibrant as I wish they were. Colors are a bit washed out. The screen to me does not look like it comes from a flagship phone, and it's just okay, but then again it is a $250 phone, which is what I always tell myself. I wish they gave option to adjust the tone of display in this device like samsung does. 2) This phone reminds of a nexus 6 and it's radios. LTE is here, but it's not as strong. Comparing phones side by side, s6 edge gives me speeds of download 70mb and upload of 30mb, while on idol 3 I get down 20 to 40 and upload 15 to 20ish. The speeds are okay, I have no issues with that. My issue is LTE signal is not strong, and a lot of times it drops to H+.Things I really like.1) Speaker is really good. 2) Comfortable to hold this device, and slim. 3) I think cameras are great. Way much better than Note 4, but not as good as S6 edge. 4) Charges really fast. 5) Call quality is great. 6) The size of the phone, just perfect.Overall this phone does deliver things that some even top phones don't. A lot of dislikes of mine can be fixed with a software update. For the price, it is definitely worth a buy."
"Alcatel",4,"Just to be upfront I got this as a backup phone for my family to share for ""just in case"" moments. I got it on a pre-order one day sale of 199.00, and couldn't pass up a good deal like that. That being said, so far I'm pretty impressed. Doesn't have the best camera, but honestly its not really that bad at all-especially at the price I paid. I'm really appreciating the fact that the interface is simple and not cluttered. The settings menu is very easy to navigate, meaning it doesn't contain a bunch of crapware that no one uses or have an over done settings menu. Poor overall user experience, unwanted/unremovable carrier and OEM software, and overdone menus are contributing to dissatisfaction and to decline for some of the bigger manufacturers, but they just don't get it.The reversible phone screen feature's a cool little item also. Comes in handy when answering the phone and allows you to have your headphone jack facing the direction you want. The screen is surprisingly bright, crisp, and device seems very responsive and runs pretty smooth so far. It doesn't have all the power that my family's main phones have, but in real life use, it's powerful enough and seems to handle everything fairly well. Some little nitpicky things I don't like, and this is just me, and this is on ANY non pure Android phone, I don't like AM/PM showing on the lock screen- it just looks off centered. I also don't like AM/PM showing in the status bar. It's unnecessy visual clutter. Your common sense clues you in on the AM/PM status of the day and Google (Nexus) is the only one that gets that. Maybe at least an option to hide it. Don't like where the power or volume keys are placed, as I said earlier the camera is not the best, but for the most part it's actually not bad. I use Google's camera and edit it with Google Photos and the pictures come out pretty decent.Once encrypted you have no choice but to listen to the boot up sound not once- but twice. YAY! Great for when you turn your phone on in a quiet setting. Everyone around you is sure to appreciate the jingle and think happy thoughts. I don't know why OEM manufacturers think we need to hear boot up sounds and jingles. Decisions like this make owning a Nexus a must for me. All androids have weak and strong points, but not including the Nexus, most of them have a lot more dumb OEM annoyances that you have to deal with, but I digress. One of many of the biggest secrets to the success of the iPhone- just one. Start putting unnecessary apps from the carrier and stupid bleeps and bloops, startup sounds, etc on the iPhone and I guarantee you the complaints would come in droves. Could you imagine Verizon, AT&T or other carriers forcing apps and software on the iPhone that you couldn't remove? It would totally hurt Apple's sales and people would be in the streets with pitchforks, torches and knives... I'm digressing again.Also, the AOSP keyboard is NOT the same as the Google keyboard, at least mine isn't. Looks exactly the same, but the swype-like slide to text feature wont work for me even though I have it set properly in settings to do so. Had to actually install Google's real keyboard from the Play Store. Obviously a bug. Not a big deal, but worth noting.Besides, having Google's keyboard (or any keyboard from the store) also means it will get updated as needed from the actual store. That won't ever happen with most AOSP keyboards or OEM keyboard unless you get a system update. My keyboard having this glitch is a perfect example. It won't get fixed anytime soon.I do like the overall look of the device. It looks fairly thin and is very light. I ordered a tempered glass screen protector and a simple TPU case for it. I do like the expandable storage, I REALLY like the small bezels, I like that it doesn't have any unnecessary branding on the front of the phone, I like its simplicity, I like that it's not overdone in the software department, I like the price I paid, (although 249 is still a good deal). Really like the front facing speakers and sound. I like the double knock to turn on, which is necessary since the power button is awkward to press. I'm also impressed that the volume button presses adjust to the orientation of the screen. So volume up is always up, and down is down- regardless of orientation. The battery life is surprisingly good, and the camera is actually a bit better than I thought it would be and is more than adequate for basic use. Nice that they threw in HDR with it.I guess the only things I'm not gung-ho about is the cluttery AM/PM (as I overly mentioned), and the other items. It also charges very quickly using its own charger and cord. I used a Samsung plug on it, but it just got really warm and would barely charge, so it may be biased to its own chargers. I'm not sure how fast it would charge speed-wise with an LG, HTC, Motorola etc, or just a generic USB plugin. Anyways the charger and plug-in that it comes with appear to be very good quality. Even my teenage daughter who is always interested in the latest and greatest Android phones, thinks it's a pretty decent phone and that's saying a lot. To her at least its ""not ugly looking."" She actually likes the icon and UI look over her Galaxy (which is kind of fixed on Samsung by using Nova Launcher). She definitely likes that it doesn't have a bunch of applications that she has to turn off or hide, and you can actually uninstall ones you don't want. That's pretty crazy in Android world. User menu is so much easier to navigate than on her Samsung. She's not excited about the camera though. If it had the same camera and screen as the GS-6, I think she would ""possibly"" swap for it ;-)I'm not expecting them to update this phone in the future, although I hope that they do. I may even consider using this as a daily driver if that happens. It would be great to see this get future Lollipop updates or get updated to Android M.Overall this is a really great phone, especially for someone on a budget or someone who wants a decent Android phone that isn't going to turn them off of Android like most low in Android phones will, sending you into the arms of an iPhone in a heartbeat. Even if you're not on a budget, this still is a definte keeper. If Alcatel keeps producing phones like this, they'll be giving the high end phone market a run for their money."
"Alcatel",3,"Got this phone on Friday and I’ve been using it ever since. Things that I like and things that I’ve noticed are somewhat out of place:Pros:• I love the screen. Bright, laminated, vivid. At this price point, it’s truly a steal.• The speakers get surprisingly loud. At first I was worried of the vibrations they created when turned up to about 70%, but I didn’t notice any distortions.• Cameras are pretty good. The focusing is on the slow side, but it usually gets it right on the first try and the exposure works well for where you tap to focus. Camera tip: to access the gallery when using the camera, just swipe left.• Battery life. I consistently get 4 to 4.5 hours of screen on time. Pretty good in my book, especially coming from a Moto X that could get 2 hours max, if I really stretched it.Cons:I will preface this by saying that I believe these are mostly software bugs that can be easily fixed with an over the air update. If anyone else has these issues or knows a fix, please feel free to comment.• For some reason unbeknownst to me, the battery screen does not show predicted battery life. On my Nexus 7, it will show the projected battery life of my device and approximately when it will reach 0% capacity. Along these lines, I also noticed that the lock screen does not show how long until the battery is fully charged.• Double tap to wake, as many others have pointed out, is gimmicky at best. When it works, which is not very often, it’s great.• My mobile connection does not seem as strong as with my Moto X. The Idol 3 shows that I have no signal in many places around my home that would traditionally have at least 2 bars.• Smart Lock with the Trusted Face function does not always work. Most of the time, it is fine. But, 1 in 30 times the camera won’t even be scanning for my face and just says that it can’t find my face. I go to the “improve face matching” in Settings, but it still says that it “couldn’t find my face”. I know the front facing camera is fine because it works when I use the camera app.All in all, I really enjoy this phone and, of course, it can’t be beat for that price! It’s just some of these software issues are somewhat annoying, so hopefully Alcatel/Google will work on some fixes. I honestly believe that these are just bugs in Android 5.0.2 because my Nexus 7 was very sluggish with the 5.0.2 update, but immediately sped up when it received the 5.1. update."
"Alcatel",1,"Do not buy this phone unless you want a phone that last 3 months the glue they used to attach the screen has weared off in 3 months so the screen is litlery pealing off my phone at this moment do not buy"
"Alcatel",5,"I can never seem to settle on a phone. I splurge on the latest new device, only to regret it for some reason or another. Sold my Moto G because the camera was terrible, sold my Note 4 because I think having a $700 phone is ridiculous.Wanted LTE band 12 (T-Mobile is building out their network coverage in rural areas especially with this frequency not supported yet by many phones), a big screen, dual band WiFi, and a price under $300.Initially passed over this phone and Alcatel altogether because it seemed like a very low end brand. This device has changed my opinion of the company. I also looked at the zte zmax and huawei p8 lite, but this Idol 3 seemed to be the best combination of affordability and features.Very customizable and near stock Android lollipop. Great screen, great speakers, decent build quality, decent main camera (seems about as good as my old S4 which was fine), above average front facing camera. Too bad it doesnt have a replaceable battery, but not a huge deal. Doesnt seem like an octa core processor, lagging at times, although not enough to annoy.I usually install custom software on my phones, but after using this phone for a while, turning off double tap to wake, and uninstalling almost all of the preinstalled apps, I like it the way it is.Because it was cheap for a smartphone, I won't be devastated if it gets dropped or cracked. Turn off double tap to wake, uninstall unwanted apps, install a different launcher if you want, install Google keyboard, be careful installing the sim card, dont expect it to behave like a $700 Note 4, and enjoy!"
"Alcatel",4,"For the money I think this is a pretty good phone. Screen is clear but not as good as I expected. Battery life is good. Speakers are very good and surprisingly loud and clear if needed. The one thing that really bugged me was the call quality. Not sure how I sounded to others but on my end voice quality sounded hollow and tinny and whatever I was listening to kept fading in and out. Pretty sure it was the phone because my cheaper back-up phone doesn't have those issues. I eventually decided to return the phone for a refund. I think a better choice, in the same price range, would be the Huawei Ascend Mate 2. Bigger screen and killer battery life. For something cheaper go with BLU."
"Alcatel",5,"I have been using this phone for over a month now. This phone is not a crap filled phone. It is perfect. Battery last long time. Screen is crisp and bright. Does not feel like a cheap phone in the hand. Front dual speakers are excellent and the JBL headphones are a super bonus. Phone is very responsive. My only negative issue is the tap on tap off feature that is a little quirky, but turn this feature off and its a great phone for a great price!!!"
"Alcatel",5,"Wonderful smarphone, i love this smarphone."
"Alcatel",4,"It is a great phone, fast, decent battery life with a great screen.I don't care for the double tap on option, The phone will butt dial people when in my pocket much more often than my previous LG phone with double tap on.The stock Alcatel Android set-up needs a little maturing for my tastes, so I installed Nova launcher and am using a lock screen option.This makes the phone experience better,"
"Alcatel",1,"Used this phone for about 2 weeks and kind of liked as I'm not a heavy user. But some while it was in the pocket, and looks like wrong password was entered number of times or God only knows what happened. When I noticed, it was at the reset screen and phone was wiped! Then I tried to enter the information, and looks like Anti theft feature kicked in and it would not verify my Google account saying password is incorrect! Tried many time...even changed the password from the laptop, and entered on the phone, no luck! Someone mentioned after changing the password, I need to wait for 3 days....I did that, but would not cross that point! Called their support, which was poorest ever for any company which just launched a new product! They ended up saying loos like Anti theft feature is somehow locked up...and I need to ship it to the repair shop and they will see what can be done....and it might take 1-2 weeks!I rather contacted Amazon as they have excellent customer service, and they started the return process! Phone is going back tomorrow..."
"Alcatel",1,"I was sent a used phone. The box was not sealed and the plastic on the screen was clearly removed and reapplied. There was hair underneath it. I attempted to exchange but I was only offered a return option. The phone was sent from Alcatel so this is no fault of Amazon.The phone itself did seem to have a bit of a lag to it. I see that a lot of reviewers blame this on the specs but It's obviously something in the Alcatel skin. I'm sure a simple OTA could solve this issue. I really had no problems with the double tap feature. It worked every time for me. The screen is very nice for a $250.00 phone. It's very bright and it has very nice color. The speakers are the best feature of the phone. The sound quality of the speakers is very close to my M8. Surprisingly, the headphone jack was rather weak. I didn't try the JBL headphones but my Klipsch headphones were not that loud. My Zenfone 2 has much better headphone output.I would have liked to at least liked to try the phone for a week before giving a review but I couldn't get passed the fact they sent me a used product. I returned it after using it for an hour. I think with root and a vanilla ROM, this could be a decent phone. It has a pretty good build quality and the screen and sound beats high end flagships. It's a shame Alcatel sent me used equipment."
"Alcatel",2,"I bought this phone for my wife after her screen had cracked on her her Moto G. I liked the nice specs with the affordable price. It was a good package and looked like a great phone. The screen was very nice, the battery was decent and the camera surprised us at the quality of the pictures. All was well with the Idol 3 until last week when the screen went bonkers and made the phone useless. The screen went an interesting shade of green and the icons were shadows of themselves making it impossible to use (see picture). Amazon was great and offered a full refund on the product along with the screen protectors and case we bought with the phone.We really wanted to like the Idol 3, but Alcatel needs to work on their quality of product."
"Alcatel",5,"i cant say enough about this phone! EXCELLENT OVER ALL PHONE!"
"Alcatel",3,"Wonderful phone, I adore watching videos on it! The audio is incredible as well as the 1080p screen. The camera also makes my instagram/snapchat photos pretty sweet.ConsThe battery life is nothing to write home about seeing as it dies without light to no use at all within 6 to 7 hours. However, it does make sense as to why. Mine heats up rather quickly and I don't like not being able to take out the batteryEdit: I loved this phone but it only lasted me 10 months. It refuses to work now even after doing a reset, taking out the sim card and anything else. I've been taking good care of it; only dropped it a few times and the screen isn't even cracked. There was no water damage. I think it was the batter. What sucks is that their batteries aren't replaceable. I'm stuck in college now with no phone and 100s of miles away from home. It's not like I needed a reliable phone"
"Alcatel",5,"Awesome phone📱📱📱📱📱📱📱📱📱"
"Alcatel",5,"It is great!!! A wonderfull phone"
"Alcatel",5,"Hey guys. I wanted to wait a while to review this phone so as to give better information about how the phone held up after regular use. Sadly, I smashed the screen and had to get a new one.First things first, I am, and have always been an adroid fan. I love how Android works and have only had Android phones. I've had HTCs, LGs, a Motorola, and two Sony's. I came straight from a Samsung S6 Active to this phone in hopes that I could have the same performance that I have grown to love from Android. I must say, I am very satisfied!! This phone has been awesome! I will say that I am not a gamer and can't provide in sight to how the phone performs in that sense. But, I am a heavy user of all the Google apps, multitasking, YouTube, all that good stuff. The phone is awesome. Front facing speakers are very loud and the screen is top notch.I replaced my 5.5 in Idol 3 for the 4.7 after smashing the screen due to the price tag. I will say that I am happy with the 4.7... BUT... If you are looking to have a solid and powerful device I'd recommend paying the extra money for the 5.5. Read the specs on both and you'll see the main differences between the phones. The 4.7 is a steal of a phone. Especially in a pinch of you need a phone quick. I am convinced you will not be disappointed with it. However, the 5.5 version is just that much better. In my opinion, its the real deal and I am happy to have owned it.It's cool to see other companies producing top quality phones with the same specs as the big companies for a fraction of the price."
"Alcatel",2,"Bought it as a gift. It was good for i wanna say 7 months maybe and now the problems never end. The power button got stuck somehow and you cant use it and you cant screenshot. It wore out very fast the battery life shortens very quickly. Being how many good reviews i saw for it both me and my significant other ( who has the phone ) were let down."
"Alcatel",4,"Update 1: I bought my first Alcatel OneTouch Idol 3 in June 2015. 6 months later it wouldn't stop shutting down. I sent it in for repair. However, they did not repair it when I got it back. I am not sure the repairman knew what he was doing. Oddly, the repairman shipped it himself to me too.Update 2: Upon writing to Alcatel through Facebook Messenger, they sent me a brand new phone. Had they not done something to make me satisfied, I would have given a scathing review of this phone. $250 might not seem like a lot, but to me it is. And I would have had to buy a new phone with a budget of probably only $50-$100. Alcatel seems like a good company. Though, they now were just bought out by Nokia.Pros:1. Price: I have had looks at my family member's Apple iPhone's and Samsung Galaxy's and they didn't seem much better than this phone in terms of speed or interface. My father's Samsung Galaxy 5 had a similar problem to mine after 1.5 years of owning it. A phone should last longer than two years in my opinion. However, even if I only get a year out of this phone, it is still a better deal than buying an iPhone or Galaxy because they are around $700-$800. So, I would only be spending $500 for two years. But then, you're in Nexus territory and that's probably a better-made phone.2. Camera: It seems really sharp to me. The ability to take HDR videos is a real plus, but the videos take up about 100 MB per minute.3. Charger: The charger is really fast. It charges in about 1-2 hours. The battery lasts for about a day if you use it a lot. If you put it on Airplane mode as I do at night, the battery goes down maybe 1-2%, which is great.4. Headphones: It comes with a pretty good set of ear-buds. They are much better quality than say a Sony pair for $20 or from the classic Apple iPods from the mid-to-late 2000's. Though, I can't say I really use them ever, because I have a good over-the-ear headphone set and a clip-on $15 one for exercising.5. Large Screen: Everyone that has seen the phone was impressed with its screen size and resolution.Cons:1. Android: I believe sometime after getting this phone, Android made it so that apps could only be stored on an SD card. I haven't completely used the 16 GB (which is really around 11 GB) in downloading apps.2. Text Messaging App: This for some reason doesn't have a ""new line"" button. You either have to send multiple text messages or you have to use the voice-to-text feature and say ""New Line."" All the other apps have a ""new line"" button that appears. It's a really odd gap to leave this out.3. Laggy after Booting or after Prolonged Non-Use: I didn't have this problem in other phones.which were only around $80. But upon rebooting the phone, I have type in my password. However, the keyboard lags in appearing or might not at all if you don't wait long enough for the phone to get its bearings OR the keyboard will appear and it you just won't be able to type on it. This probably happens the majority of the time.This also happens if the phone hasn't been in use for awhile like when I have it in airplane mode at night and then turn it off. This happens probably 1/3 of the time.4. Memo App: Its built-in memo app doesn't have an email function or an option to copy them to an SD card.5. Calendar-to-Map: I put in my addresses for places I need to go to for my appointments. However, if the notification for the even comes up and I click the address, it will open up Google Maps through Chrome instead of just through Maps. It's an extra step that is sort of annoying especially when driving. So, I have to make sure I am ready to go before driving basically.6. Smart Lock: Its trusted places function requires me to have do the same place multiple times if I go to a different level in my house or even a different room.Despite what other reviewers have been saying on here about Alcatel being a horrible company when it comes to customer service, I have found this not to be true so far. Even though they failed to fix my original phone, they got it back to me within a 7-day time frame from the time I sent it in to when I received it."
"Alcatel",5,"I rarely give things 5-stars, but this phone is worth it. AMAZING Performance!I started using this phone 6-months ago, so I can give you a valid review over time.Why do I love this phone?- Bright display that I can read in direct sunlight. Brighter than the LGG3, HTC One, iPhone6 and the Samsung Galaxy Note 4- Loud and High quality speakers! JBL stereo front facing speakers and JBL headphones.- Excellent Camera! 13mp camera is by Sony.- ""Reversible Interface"" First phone to offer this feature. The screen orients right-side-up even when you turn the phone upside-down, so the phone is never upside-down- Great battery life; I can Facebook and chat all day on one charge.- Easy to manage and close running applicationsWhat I don't really like about the phone?- Slippery and easy to drop without a case.- Not many cases available."
"Alcatel",5,"Lots of folks have posted glowing reviews of this phone, so I will simply say that I also love this phone for the same reasons everyone else loves it. It's a fantastic value. But the primary reason I was shopping for a new phone was that my previous phone had an unreliable GPS unit. I couldn't find much commentary on the GPS unit on the Alcatel but there were some hints that it might be better, so I took a chance. I like to use the phone with the Ramblr app to create GPS tracks of hikes. With my previous phone it would take a long time (five minutes was not unusual) to get a satellite fix so I could start the track. And then the phone would give me bad points occasionally, sometimes freezing at a point in the middle of the hike, requiring extensive editing after the hike to correct the trail. I needed a phone with a better GPS unit, and I found it in the Alcatel One Touch Idol 3! The GPS on this phone just works! Satellite fix at the start of the hike takes just a few seconds, and the track continues flawlessly throughout the hike. If you're looking for an Android phone with a reliable GPS unit, this unit should do a fine job for you."
"Alcatel",5,"This phone is awesome!! The display is bright and clear, the sound is fantastic. Internet connection also great. I use straight talk and have no problems. Buy this phone."
"Alcatel",5,"Price and quality: super"
"Alcatel",4,"Is an acceptable phone considering it costs about 140 dollarsOctacoreNice speakers (JBL)Acceptable screen.Android 6I havethis phone about a month, and restart only once. I don't know what will happen in the future, but is enough phone for me."
"Alcatel",1,"This phone failed 34 days after my order. I have no recourse to return based on the 30 day policy. There is not even a clear ability to communicate to Amazon about this.This is an unfortunate customer service issueWould not purchase again"
"Alcatel",5,"Marvelous screen, camera, speaker sound."
"Alcatel",4,"I have been using it for only a couple of weeks and it is working quite nicely. A great improvement from my previous Alcatel phone. I only wish there were a phone with the same specifications in a smaller size, like a 5"" or less. I was torn between this one and the ALCATEL OneTouch Idol 3 Global Unlocked 4G LTE Smartphone, 4.7 HD. However, this one is much better in all aspects except size. So, it is a compromise for me.If it weren't for that I would probably be closer to 5 stars."
"Alcatel",5,"I was not really expecting much for the price I paid, $100.I have no complaints. It meets my budget and my needs."
"Alcatel",5,"I have had this phone close to a month now I am beyond impressed. I will never buy a $400-700 phone again as long as this company is making quality phones for a reasonable price."
"Alcatel",5,"I LIKE THE PHONE L OUT A lot"
"Alcatel",5,"The phone has everything I need at an irresistible price !! The signal is very strong when I'm in places that did not have any sign ... Camera is decent...sound incredible !! I do not play with cell so the battery lasts me two days !! The connectivities WiFi and all are very good !!"
"Alcatel",5,"Great alternative phone for teens instead of far more expensive ones. Works with AT&T 4Glte"
"Alcatel",5,"Love this phone. Fairly quick page loading, handles as many apps as you want ( currently 40+ and counting). little to no bloatware, good Bluetooth range, and great speakers. Video quality and sound quality is way above average streaming video and music. I can only see two small drawbacks and one may never be a drawback, only a foreseeable one.One is that the battery is not removable. I have had a phone that would not shut off, with the ""Read It to Me"" app running, reading off text messages with the only alternative to remove the battery to stop it.The other difficulty with this phone is it's dual sim, sd card tray. You must use a little tool to get it out. Then you must balance the chips on the tray and slide it in. So if you tremble then inserting the chips would seem to be impossible to me! I lost a sim chip when pulling the tray out and the chip flying off the tray into the trash.All in all, this is hands down the best phone that I have ever owned. I highly recommend this to any android phone user. I also recommend buying a case and screen protector with your purchase. I have read several other reviews that said it is very fragile. But most phones are fragile in my opinion!One other thing to consider is that this phone runs on Android 6.0.1 so if you want the newest operating system (Marshmallow or better) then don't buy this phone. I have not researched it yet but there may be ways to upgrade the o.s. on this phone"
"Alcatel",4,"I came to this phone from using a Nexus 4 for the last two and a half years and my initial impressions were very mixed. Starting with the positive things, I love the LTE, the bigger and more color accurate screen, the battery life, the expandable storage, the dual front facing speakers, and how light it is and how thin it is. All big improvements! I also appreciate the very light touch Alcatel used with their skin on Android. It's almost stock.So many great things and yet it was almost all brought down by an Achilles heel. The thing that really bugged me was that moving in and out of apps was really sluggish and choppy and not smooth at all. All of these things are super smooth on the Nexus 4, which is a 2012 phone. Even swipe typing on Google Keyboard was not great. I came pretty close to sending it back and getting a new Moto G.(I have no proof of this, but my guess is that the phone sends almost all of its processes to the slower of the two chipsets in the Snapdragon 615, the one clocked at 1ghz. Unfortunately there's no ""high performance"" option anywhere that would make everything run on the 1.5ghz chipset. The Nexus 4 proves this is plenty to run Android smoothly.)I didn't want to get a Moto G, especially after seeing (and hearing, seriously those speakers are great) this phone. Thankfully, Android is a pretty flexible OS and I was able to take matters into my own hands and make things more palatable. First thing I did was turn all animations off in the developer options. Second thing I did was I installed Nova launcher and selected the options to make things run ""faster than light."" Everything is MUCH smoother after doing those two things. Still not quite as smooth as the Nexus 4, but probably 95% of the way there. Close enough where I can deal with it and I can enjoy the good things about the phone that I admittedly skimped on in the first paragraph.So I really like this phone now. It's everything I wanted. It just took some tinkering to get there."
"Alcatel",1,"Worst phone ever. I have just got it for 7 days. Somehow there is scratch on the touch screen. I for sure did not drop it. Or perhaps I pressed on the screen too hard? Then the touch screen is totally doomed. I think they just used regular glass. I had HTC M8 before, which was dropped out of hand a few times but there was never a scratch on the screen. Quality of the cell phone is a big concern. The cell phone gets heated very quickly after playing a small game or chatting for over 10 minutes."
"Alcatel",3,"Gps problems, everything else is great, but it can't lock gps position to save it's life. Constantly says gps signal lost"
"Alcatel",5,"This Smartphone has met My expectations and then some. It is extremely fast and does what it says, this was a upgrade from My last Alcatel, it was well worth the money when considering other high end Smartphones. I highly recommend this phone to anyone who wants to upgrade without the big price tag. 5 Stars To Alcatel.!!!"
"Alcatel",5,"Excellent"
"Alcatel",5,"Crear productos."
"Alcatel",4,"This is a great phone. Sound Quality is great, the stripped down Android OS was perfect for me as I am a programmer and am making my own apps on the device. The drivers being built into the phone is a cool feature. The flip around feature on the phone is fun to use at parties. Battery life is about a day of heavy use. The only real drawbacks of the phone have been the inability to disassemble the phone without voiding the warranty. I'd give this phone 5 stars if it were able to be taken apart to replace the battery easily."
"Alcatel",4,"This phone sounds great and feels great. I wish the text messaging app was better and I don't like the placement of the power button. Those are small issues that I can deal with. The best phone around for $249."
"Alcatel",4,"This phone so far has been a good mix between value, design and performance. I can only hope that Alcatel continues building a budget/ performance friendly phone for the Android OS."
"Alcatel",4,"I did a lot of research and video review watching about this phone before buying it. I'm very glad I did. For a company known for making terrible phones this phone is Dynamite. It's quick, responsive and best of all come with no bloatware.The speakers are amazing and even when bluetooth ed the sound is great.I definitely recommend putting a silicone cover on it. The phone is very slippery without it.The only downfall was that it did go haywire once requiring it to be hard restarted and all the dates were changed to 1970.I love this phone and hope it last a long time."
"Alcatel",5,"I absolutely love this phone. Great performance, UI, very sleek and the dual speakers on the front produce high-quality sound for their size.Most importantly for me and also the reason I recommend this phone to everyone is the outstanding price. Priced at $250 I was able to purchase a 64gb microSD card and a quality case while remaining under my budget of $300. I know some people would prefer the smaller version (4.7""), and it has an even better pricetag at $180.Some flaws would be lack of mobile service providers (Verizon, Sprint) and the inability to access the photo gallery through the camera app, which has been a standard feature of most phones for quite some time now.For me these drawbacks don't impact the overall score of this phone. I had to switch from Verizon to t-mobile, but have had better coverage and a smaller bill as a result. I could see the camera / gallery issue being a nuisance to some people but to me it's a very minor inconvenience.Overall this phone has much to offer. For music fans it has even more to offer, including a turntables feature built-in to the music player allowing you to crossfade between your songs.Strongly consider the Alcatel OneTouch idol 3 if you're searching for a high quality no-contract phone for an exceptional price."
"Alcatel",4,"Very good budget phone, love it."
"Alcatel",5,"Excellent product. Friendly, versatile, fast, very good pictutes and what a sound! And charge very fast! I love it! The performance can get improved"
"Alcatel",2,"Well, I had this phone for a bit so I guess its time for a review.The good--Looks nice-Feels nice in hand-The audio quality is actually pretty awesome-Screen is pretty goodThe bad--Battery life is average at best-Switching the power/volume button sides from the norm- I thought I would get used to it, after months still not so and it gets annoying-Crashes/locks up at least once a day-The speakers collect a ton of pocket debris-Somewhat slow to charge using any charger including a 2.4a fast charger- ~75% of the time when I answer my phone the speaker phone is active but not showing so in the UI. I have to toggle it on, then off again to get it to normal. SUPER annoying when you hold a phone with speakers this loud to your ear and someone starts talking. I never use speaker phone or a headset so it has nothing to do with anything but the phone.-This is Alcatel's best and they can't give it Gorilla Glass or comparable? This thing is fragile. Mine slipped off the kitchen counter and landed in a bowl of crunchy dog food and shattered. Yes, I had it in a case. The way the screen sticks out a bit seems to make it a magnet for breakage according to me and what looks like a lot of other people.-Price There seems to be a lot of pretty nice what I would call secondary brand Androids coming out lately. Many of them at this price point and some even lower. This phone is probably $50-$75 more than it should be right now.In conclusion-Do your shopping and comparing wisely. I would bet that most of you reading this review are like me, tired of paying $600+ for Samsung or Apple phones that are also locked. While this and no other phones at this price are, or compare to those brands, I enjoy the savings and my new found freedom. This phone doesn't compare to my Note 4, nor did I expect it to. Also, the truth is that I don't really miss my Note. 95% of the features that made the note so awesome got turned off by me anyhow. I don't use NFC, face tracking, eye scrolling etc. I literally never even used the S-pen. What I did use- this phone has, but so do a lot of reasonably prices phones now. I'm not necessarily saying don't buy it, you might love it. Just make sure you know your options and if you choose this- DON'T DROP IT lol."
"Alcatel",4,"GREAT PHONE, SUPER CAMERAHOWEVER, BATTERY LIFE IS HORRIBLE, HAVE TO CHARGE IT TWICE A DAY EVEN WHEN I DON'T USE"
"Alcatel",5,"Great phone. Supports T-Mobile band 12. Premium phone at a bargain price."
"Alcatel",5,"I've had this for about 3 months now. Coming from an HTC 1S. This is an awesome phone once you replace a few apps. The camera app is so so. I switched to Camera 360. Google camera is also decent. Huge difference. The launcher is ok, but I highly recommend switching to Nova free or some other highly reviewed launcher like Action, Go etc.. Another huge difference can be realized by installing DU Battery Saver. Do these three things and you will have a great phone that has incredible audio, very good camera, and superb battery life. I used to go down to about 30% at the end of the day with my HTC and about 35-45% with this phone until I installed DU battery saver. Now I'm at about 50 to as high as 70% at the end of the day. I recommended my daughter install this on her LG G4. She said she already had it and it didn't help much so this may be phone dependent. I'm not a shill for this app just know it works great with this phone. I really like the fact that it doesn't come pre-installed with much bloatware, and the fact that you can uninstall almost all of it if you want. An absolutely great deal at this price. It's not even debatable. Pay $250 and avoid the provider contracts. You won't be disappointed. Also, their customer service is great. T-Mobile accidentally deactivated my ESN and killed my phone. I had to send it in for repair. They received it Monday, and shipped it back out Tuesday, and I received it Thursday."
"Alcatel",5,"It's overall a great device for the price especiallyThe price. Front facing speakers always recommend on a phone, Display you really can'tTell the difference. I've seen great full HD screens and some 720p. Don't be a display snobIf you can't afford a higher end device. Definite buy in my book, make sure you get a case and temper glass and I've heard stories about how soft the materials are on the idol3."
"Alcatel",5,"Excellent, very good investment."
"Alcatel",4,"Like the phone a lot. Decent battery, fast enough, good stock Android. Can't beat the price for what you get."
"Alcatel",4,"for the price I don't think you can beat it. It stutters opening video and audio and the HDR sometimes leaves artifacts, but the screen, speakers, and camera are overall very decent. Battery life is very good.Since the software update it hasn't had the stuttering issue. I sent mine in with a broken digitizer and Alcatel sent it back for days later fixed. All I paid was shipping."
"Alcatel",4,"Phone appears to perform well, be careful not to over drive the JBL speakers - they can usually not take full volume playing media.The issue with this phone is the yellowish tint screen, common on low-end phones. Alcatel please explain this. Update - Yellow screen is caused by screen adhesive not properly cured / aged before shipment. The phone appears to be moving toward proper hue with use. Obviously, these great phones were shipped out as soon as the boxes were sealed."
"Alcatel",2,"The phone itself is great for the price but... it randomly drops signal completely and does not regain signal for several minutes at a time. It is also laggy when browsing the web, taking several seconds to respond. With the specs considered, this phone should not have lagging problems, so hopefully they will be releasing a software update to fix this at some point."
"Alcatel",5,"I'll spare the specs--they're easily found elsewhere. The phone's design, however, is of a very well balanced upper-mid range telephone for a lower-mid level price. The sound is fantastic, it has great cameras and the radio will communicate on every T-Mobile and AT&T frequency band in the US (which should include providers that use AT&T or T-Mobile's underlying networks). For T-Mobile customers, the LTE Band 12 (700 MHz) indeed penetrates buildings like only AT&T customers previously enjoyed, when in enable US locations (search for T-Mobile 700 Mhz for more details). The updated radio and being designed for Android version 5 makes this phone more than just a cheaper version of the previous generation's phone, but instead a modern phone albeit a bit easy on the computing horsepower. If you need top processing power, look to the big names' flagship phones; otherwise the Idol 3 will likely fill any other needs (but consider adding an SD Card if you have a lot of media or photos)"
"Alcatel",5,"My TakeHere's my take on this phone. I had an HTC 816 on Virgin Mobile. I was very happy with the phone, but looking to get away from the VM service which was spotty in key locations for me. I sold my HTC as soon as this was announced and switched to Cricket with a Lumia 635 to hold me over until this arrived. I did not like the 635 one bit, and I became increasingly anxious for this phone to be delivered. I watched and read all the reviews to hold me over. I got the phone delivered swapped my sim and was up and running in less than 10 minutes. It was a busy holiday weekend with my family, including lots of driving so I didn't get to play with this as much as I would have liked, but I'm finally getting it fully optimized today. I paid $199 for this phone and feel it was an exceptional value. I love the size and ordered a slim case from China ($4 and delivered less than 2 weeks) to protect the edges without adding significant bulk.Here's here I felt this phone met my expectations-1- Battery life seems great so far, enough for 1 day of moderate usage. It seems to be getting better after each charge.2- Display and sound are as advertised and satisfactory in my opinion.3- Phone doesn't seem laggy with normal app usage and video watching. I'm not a gamer so I can't speak for that.4- Look and feel of phone is excellent. The build quality is nice, and doesn't feel any different from a ""true flagship"" with my slim skin on.Here's a couple minor quirks that I didn't love-1- reversible mode sounded cool in theory, but I disabled as I found it silly based on my own preferences.2- Double tap to wake was a little tricky, and I found my phone had awaken in my pocket a few times and opened up apps. I disabled and went back to using power button.All-in-all, I love this phone and think I will grow to enjoy it more as I get more used to it. I use with Cricket wireless service (on AT&T network) and it seems to work flawlessly. Good luck selecting the right phone for you."
"Alcatel",3,"my impressions after 3 days:positives:1. great battery life. i would guess 6+ hours screen time easy.2. speakers are absolutely awesome.3. the screen is excellent and very bright. wish we could reduce the brightness (might give longer battery life to boot!).4. no problems with wifi or other things like heat etc.5. user experience is fast enough - better than nexus 4.6. good build quality.negatives:1. camera (ok for the money).2. need unlocked boot loader and root desperately. alcatel needs to realize who their customers are (i.e., what type of people buy their phones!) and provide what they need.biggest negative (unacceptable!):1. tmobile reception is like approx 10dBm lower than nexus 4 overall. where signal is poor, i used to get LTE with nexus 4, but now I can't. IMHO, this is a deal breaker for me. seriously thinking on returning this :(.Added image with both phones side by side. The image is from a place where I have excellent reception. From a place where I have poor reception, the nexus 4 has strength approx -108dBm and holds LTE, but idol 3 is less than -120dBm and cannot hold LTE and reverts to HSPA/UMTS.other:antutu 64bit score is ~33000."
"Alcatel",5,"I preface this review by noting that (1) I rarely write product reviews, and (2) I only had this phone for a day so far. With these disclaimers out of the way, I'm simply amazed at the quality and features of this device. Coming from an LG Optimus G and a Fire Phone, the Alcatel Idol 3 is miles and miles better than either device - especially the Fire with its gimped UI and other gimmicks.Amongst the standout features are the high-quality screen, front-facing speakers, and its overall compact size. Alcatel has accomplished quite an engineering feat here by squeezing a huge screen and battery into a package barely larger than 4.7 inch phones out there. This device is also incredibly lightweight at around 140g and, just as important, the weight is evenly distributed. Coming from a 4.7 inch screen devices, I don't think I'll be going back anytime soon...As for the software and other features, I'm happy to report it runs an almost flavor of Android 5.0 (Lollipop). The performance is snappy despite featuring a mid-level chipset in the Snapdragon 615; likewise the camera looks good with only the autofocus being a bit slow. It includes a microSD slot so you can add additional memory cards if necessary. I should mention that it takes microSIM-sized cards in case you're switching from a phone that takes a different form factor of SIM. Last but not least, I use T-Mobile as my carrier and have not fallen off the LTE speed band yet (in the DC area).All in all, I think this is a no-brainer for anyone looking for a new Android phone with a large screen. I spent a lot of time researching prior to making this purchase, especially comparing this to the Asus Zenfone 2, and this Idol 3 won out in the end. Aside from the attractive price and features as mentioned, I have to highlight that this phone includes the LTE Band 12. Band 12 is used exclusively by T-Mobile in the U.S. and supposedly allows better indoor penetration and network reception. Something to keep in mind if you're looking to switch to or currently have T-Mobile, since very phones today have this - the Asus Zenfone 2 certainly does not."
"Alcatel",5,"Beautiful phone at an incredible price point. The display is bright and vibrant; images really pop out at you. The 5.5"" screen makes the phone very easy to use and text is crystal clear. The 1080P screen is simply beautiful. It almost goes edge-to-edge as well - not a lot of wasted space. The octa-core processor makes it extremely responsive, almost instantaneously doing whatever you tell it to do. The rear camera is 13 megapixel, although it is 4:3 at that quality. I leave it on 10MP (16:9) and the photos it takes are magnificent. The stereo speakers on the front, powered by JBL, are really good too. The phone is light, and thin, making it easy to handle and store. TLDR: Amazing phone at an affordable price."
"Alcatel",5,"Best phone I have ever had. In my life I have owned iphone 3gs, iphone 4, and samsung galaxy s3. All overpriced.Huge HD screen, amazing battery life-- lasts the entire day. New name brand phones just aren't worth it anymore. You are practically just paying for a name. I don't care for the latest and fastest phone, because it's just a phone. Definitely never going back unless this thing craps out on me prematurely. Will update if that happens."
"Alcatel",5,"For $250, this is as close to $600 flagship you will ever get. The SD615 isn't quite as fast as the 801 in OPO, but it is close and Chrome runs about the same speed. 6hrs screen on and two more hours blasting the speakers before the battery got to 8%. Tmob reception is better than the OPO by 1.5 bars most of the time. The speakers... omg just awesome full deep sound, focus more on the bass but i prefer that. The build, it is so light and thin i forget it is in my pocket. the brushed plastic on the back feels nice to hold, doesn't attract fingerprints. i was afraid the Dragontrail glass would be a fingerprint magnet, but no it isn't. its been a long time since i had a phone with an FM tuner on it... they need to bring this back. even with music freedom on tmob, using the FM radio uses far far less battery than music streaming. oh and the screen... had one guy say, wow that screen looks great, nuff said with the high brightness and deep blacks, looks like an OLED panel tbh.Cons: hard to think of one, side bezels are so thin expect unauthorized tap registers when holding it tight. forget about using it with one hand. so thin and light it does feel rather... like it needs a case.Verdict = if you don't buy flagships, get this phone."
"Alcatel",4,"Great phone so far. Still relearning Android phones after years with a Windows phone. Will have to update review at a later date."
"Alcatel",5,"Awesome phone"
"Alcatel",5,"Love it.."
"Alcatel",5,"Increible :D"
"Alcatel",4,"Good"
"Alcatel",5,"VERY IMPRESSIVE PHONE, AND THE BIGGER SCREEN AND 1080 DISPLAY IS VERY GOOD. PROBABLY THE BEST SOUNDING PHONE IVE EVER HEARD WITH ITS JBL SPEAKER SYSTEM."
"Alcatel",4,"good phone great price i am happy"
"Alcatel",4,"love it, only wish the battery was removable however it works very well. and shipping was very quick"
"Alcatel",5,"Very good phone. Price can't be beat for what you get. Should've bought two."
"Alcatel",5,"My son asked me to order this particular phone for him. He is very happy with it. He had done researches on phone before deciding on this one. He is thrilled that the phone is exactly what he expected."
"Alcatel",5,"UPDATED REVIEW:The phone was repaired, without any problems, and it works perfectly again. The repair center was in Dallas, TX, and they did a good job, in just a few days. The hardest part was filling in the form on their website: getting the IMEI off the phone, getting the proof of purchase, and selecting the proper fields for the issue.This is truly an awesome phone.Now I notice the price has gone down since we bought it, so anybody who wants an Android phone at 5"" or bigger has NO reason to ignore this. At this point, it cannot be beaten for the price (even if, like mine, the networking chip dies and you have to send it off for repair).ORIGINAL REVIEW:I wanted to give 5 stars for this, since it has performed nearly perfectly for the past 2 months. And for the price, this has been the best 5.5"" phone value available anywhere.But sadly, I am worried about the build quality of these phones. Today I woke up, and after 2 months of use, the SIM card is not recognized, and the Wifi is completely dead. The phone has no networking support at all.It seems to be a hardware problem, as I have tried the SIM in another phone and it works fine, and removed SD and SIM, and done factory reset, and the problem is the same. It starts to feel hot on the back, and it will even reboot itself after trying to scan for available Wifi networks when switching the Wifi off and on again.Since Amazon only allows 30 days for returns, I have to figure out how to return it to Alcatel (I hope I can return it after just 2 months). I have another Idol 3 phone, the 4.7"", and it's slightly less than 2 months old. Please wish me luck that this doesn't happen again, and I can get this broken one replaced."
"Alcatel",4,"This is a very good phone for a reasonable price. I didn't realize the size I was buying (I thought it was the smaller version), so I'm disappointed with the size. Aside from that, the phone performs admirably, and it's recently been updated with Marshmallow (Android v6).I have experienced some quirks with the phone. The screen sometimes shuts off in the middle of inputting my PIN as though the device were inactive. I have to open it again and start entering the PIN again. The Marshmallow update fixed a problem with the Play Music app, which would lock the phone when starting the app. I had to open the phone, swipe, re-enter the PIN, unlock and then I could actually use the app. As you can imagine, this was very annoying, but it's thankfully fixed with Marshmallow. The first problem persists, though it doesn't happen too often.Reception is good. Battery life is good (for my use, anyway). Screen quality and brightness are good. The interface is a bit awkward because of the phone's large size and button placements. It's a little unwieldy to reach the volume buttons and the power button is tougher. Camera quality is reasonable in good light, but overall it's a poor substitute for a decent camera (or even an iPhone, really). Speakers are very good, stereo, and loud.I probably wouldn't buy it again but only because of its large size. If that doesn't bother you, this is a very good buy."
"Alcatel",5,"Perfect!"
"Alcatel",4,"The speakers are great.2 bad sides are that the screen is humped over the speakers so the screen would get scratched easily. The second is that when switching from earpiece to speakerphone, there is a 10 second blank delay where you can't hear the other person, but they can hear you."
"Alcatel",5,"Great phone! Great battery! Highly recommend. Don't buy cheap Chinese brands. I bought 2 chinese brands from amazon and one lasted one year, the other only a few months. Buy the Alcatel."
"Alcatel",1,"I will start off by saying this phone has been excellent and worked flawlessly until recently. I have had the phone for about 4 months now, and it has been inside a case. The power button has stopped functioning correctly. I can still feel mechanical action of the button functioning correctly, but the button is not working electrically possibly due to a broken solder joint. I say this because I get occasional functionality if I press the button to the point that it feels like it will break the phone, and when this works the screen may flash on and off three times as if it was electrically connected three times.Alcatel's support / warranty requires the owner to pay for shipping to and from their facility, leaving the owner without a phone for the duration of shipping+repairs. This level of support for a broken phone under warranty is unacceptable."
"Alcatel",4,"Very happy with the Alcatel Idol, it meets all my needs. It's a very SMART phone. The only downside is a non replaceable battery. By the time it would need a new battery, it's time to upgrade the phone."
"Alcatel",5,"I have a Cricket Wireless sim card and I was looking for a nice phone to use it in. I have had several Blu phones but they seem to be quirky, never get upgraded to the latest operating system and their customer service is bad.I discovered that this Alcatel was a unlocked smartphone and gave it a try. I was impressed as soon as I opened the box! This phone has a 5.5"" screen, same as my old phone, and felt great in my hands.The reception is great and I usually get an LTE signal out here in the corn fields. The JBL speakers are outstanding! They are placed in the front of the phone, one at the top and the other at the bottom. It is great hearing bass when streaming a movie. The only problem with the speakers is that I can not get them turned down just one more notch. The lowest setting is pretty loud and I have tried all the sound settings in the phone. This is my only pet peeve.The phone updated some Alcatel settings as soon as I turned it on then updated its self to Marshmallow right afterwards. There is very little bloatware which is great. You can add a mini SD card and you have a choice between leaving it as is or you can have the phone include the mini SD card into internal memory. You can have 32gb plus what ever you add with a mini card. I added a 32gb mini SD card so now I have 64gb of internal memory.This phone also has NFC which can be used in many ways. Very few smartphone in this price range have NFC.For the price and features, this Alcatel can not be beat!"
"Alcatel",2,"Had to return. Some issues"
"Alcatel",5,"I bought it for my husband and he loves it. Quite big for every day use but excellent for its price."
"Alcatel",5,"I am so loving this phone a lot! Especially now that it has Marshmallow. Great battery life! The front facing speakers make watching videos and playing games an enjoyable experience. It's 5.5"" screen along with its resolution make the experience even better. Its not up to par with flagship phones but coming from an entry level phone this product is excellent! It does have little lags here and there but its not a bid deal. These minor hiccups I can live with. 2Gb ram really makes it work faster and multi tasking is a breeze if you don't have a lot of apps open. I am not a heavy app user so I don't have a lot of apps on my phone so the 11 gb memory is sufficient for me.I would highly recommend this product!"
"Alcatel",4,"Forget liking this device I Love It. The sound from the front facing stereo speakers are amazing. No need for separate Bluetooth speakers anymore. The 5.5in LCD screen is pretty amazing. I personally prefer amoled/oled screens but in comparison this screen holds it own. The camera is pretty basic but can produce some great shots in auto mode as well with manual controls. Very thin and light to the point that it feels like maybe the battery is missing or that this is a demo/dummy phone with no guts. Very durable though as tested by accident when the kids dropped the phone and it slid across the tiled kitchen floor on its screen and showed no signs of damage without screen protector applied or case on it. Do wish that the company included a clear case though. Usb type c and water resistant are on my wish list too."
"Alcatel",5,"I have had the Idol 3 for 3 days now and I am in love with it! I was a windows phone user before, first time using an android phone in fact, and I love it. The battery works pretty good, I consider myself a heavy user and the battery lasted one whole day, that never happened with my lumia.The camera works pretty well too, I thought I would worry about the size since my hands arent that big, but no issue! The design is just perfect, I like it very much.I missed the LED light too! My lumia didnt have it either. If you usually watch vids or play games, nothing better than the idol 3. The speakers and the size screen are excellent! I just watched a movie with the phone and everything went very well!I just cant wait to order my case, there are no cases in my country for this phone, and I am disaster! lolIf anything happens, I will update.Overall: Excellent phone for an excellent price! Nothing to regret."
"Alcatel",4,"Very good phone but when I got the case I had the phone in my pocket while riding my bike it came out fell to the ground and broke the screen"
"Alcatel",5,"First things first, this is not a perfect phone, but it is pretty damn close and factoring the price I got it for $99, this has been one of the better phones I have used recently. So long story short, broke my Nexus 6 and didn’t want to spend a lot of money on a new phone. I tried out a Sony Ultra C5, I didn’t like the screen at all, otherwise nice phone, so I sold it. Then I tried an LG G3 and it was a great phone but the GPS and camera were terrible. Finally I saw this phone on sale for $99 and figured why not?Well it was a great decision. This phone has been updated to Android 6.01 and everything runs well on it for the most part. This is not a fast phone, but it is a fast enough phone. I am able to browser this Internet, play emulators, and watch movies with ease. Again, it isn’t perfect but for $100, or around that price, it is an amazing value!Highlights:- Fast enough CPU/GPU (with occasional freezes/stuttering, but doesn't get too hot)- Expandable storage- Wonderful front facing speakers that can fill a small room with sound- Decent 1080p IPS LCD screen- Near stock android skin- Excellent all day (with moderate usage) battery life- Fantastic 8mp rear facing camera- Great audio quality with headphones- Surprisingly good call quality- Built in music app is fun and useful- NO BLOATWARELowlights:- Front facing camera is only average with poor low light performance- Multi Media messages like group texts, email texts, and photo texts don’t work on stock messaging app- CPU/GPU does stutter occasionally- Phone is a bit ungainly and slippery in hand for one-hand usagePro-tipsTo fix the MMS bug I mentioned about texts under lowlights, use a third party program off the Google Play Store such as Textra. Additionally, I disabled the “enhanced 4G LTE” setting on the phone and that seemed to help.As for the display, it is great for the price, but it tends to run a little on the “cooler” side in terms of color. You can adjust your color hue under settings. I personally bumped it up one on the color warmth and it looks significantly better. Furthermore, the phone display is extremely bright so things may look a little washed out. To fix this, find an area that is well lit (one that represents where you spend most of your day), and then slide the brightness all the way down, then slowly increase it until you find the colors have the right look about them. Personally, I have mine set to about 35-40% brightness. You can always flip the brightness to “auto” when you go into an extremely bright or dark area."
"Alcatel",2,"buy mobile to you, but I do not work 3G band is only 2G and LTE, also does not come with the onetouch stream."
"Alcatel",5,"I paid $99 here on Amazon and honestly not sure how anyone is staying in business for these specs at that price. The only thing really lacking is a gyroscope but for the price I can't really complain that it's missing. This is loaded with android 6.0.1, everything seems really snappy. This is the first phone I've used with soft keys and it's not bad. The front facing speakers are surprisingly good. However compared to my last phone the audio stream over blutooth is not as loud, meaning in my car I have to turn the dial up in order to have the same volume. I'd advise turning off the JBL special effects otherwise you'll end up with muddled music that is overly bassy, Although maybe you'll like it. The key is that you can atleast toggle this feature on or off depending on your taste.Pros:Nice screen sizePleasant designFront facing speakers sound really great (but will sound distorted at max volume)Speaker and microphone on both sides so you can answer/talk no matter which orientation you have the phone.Micro SD storageLong lasting batteryScreen will work in any orientation (nice for when you want to have the charging cable on the top vs bottom while in the car)Con:No gyroscope"
"Alcatel",3,"Hi.The description of the product say: Is global unlocked and can use in 4LTE but it doesnt work, If you can help me I'll really appreciate that.Anything else is ok.ALCATEL OneTouch Idol 3 Global Unlocked 4G LTE Smartphone, 5.5 HD IPS Display, 16GB (GSM - US Warranty)"
"Alcatel",5,"A great phone but I spend way too much on other accessories which had me throwing it away in the trash."
"Alcatel",5,"Really good phone for the price ($99.99) the phone works well and I am very satisfied with my purchase. The phone has 13mp back camera and it can shoot 1080p HD videos. My service provider is Metro PCS and they were able to activate my phone without any trouble. However I paid a $25 activation fee because I had to purchase a new sim card. Overall i am happy with the phone and i hope it will last a while."
"Alcatel",1,"I am kicking myself for buying this phone. All I really wanted was a phone to make calls,txt,and use a few apps. Not a heavy user.PROBLEMS started after the 15 day return policy. My reception was poor to say the least. At home my wife's Apple 4 was getting 3 bars and no reception problems. Sometimes I would get 3 bars but mostly ""no service"" or ""emergency only"". So I buy a signal booster for the house...great for my wife, no help for me. Next the pattern swipe for access doesn't work. You end up calling Mexico for help and they want you to go thru ""factory reset"". So I do...3 times. I still have failure of pattern swipe again and the reception hasn't improved. Now they want it back to fix or replace so I'm without a phone while they diddle around with it. If you're thinking about buying this phone....keep thinking!"
"Alcatel",4,"Great phone, first thing I did was update it which took about 20 minutes, it was well worth the wait. There was a lot of lag at first but after the setup everything was smooth. Then I installed my 64 GB SD card and off loaded all the apps I can while setting my camera, voice recorder and music defaults to the SD card ( 16 GBs with only 10 free is pretty low now a days) so with all my apps and cashe totals to about 3.5 gbs combined with 6.5 ish to spare on the phone for apps that can't be off loaded to the SD card.The build reminds me of a better thought out Samsung s4, screen is awesome coming from a flagship HTC m8 and speakers are on par! The plastic build has some defects on the corners, some paint imperfection but you really had to look for it. Peformance wise I didn't noticed much from my HTC m8 I would say I'm not hard core on my mobile devices, just social, YouTube, some games and lot of web browsing. The nice touches of reversibility and double tap to wake are great additions and make a lot of sense ( although I forget its hard to take a picture upside down ). Almost stock android is a delight to use, at first I was so dumbfounded on how much less I had to do to set up the device, which caused me to stare at it and wonder what esle to do.Over all I would give it a 4.5 just because of the small defects in the paint, never the less an awesome phone for the price."
"Alcatel",3,"Tells me emegency calls for no reason"
"Alcatel",5,"So far I like it very much!"
"Alcatel",1,"This item was damaged really bad I ended up having to pay for repairs...this wasn't a good buy on my end....in case your wondering the screen fell off the device."
"Alcatel",3,"I really, really wanted to love this phone. I mean, what more could you ask for?! Super thin and light. Stereo front facing speakers with amazing sound quality. Full HD screen both bright and crisp. Nearly pure version of Android Lollipop. Respectable battery life. JBL headset IN THE BOX. Attractive looks that are just enough different from the crowd for people to ask, ""hey, what kind of phone is THAT?""Sounds great, right? The problem for me is two-fold. 1) There are only 11 GB of available storage on the phone, which is really, really small. Well, you say, that shouldn't be a problem because it supports Micro SD cards up to 128GB, right? 2) Yes, it does support Micro SD cards but the implementation is almost unusable.You cannot move apps from the phone to the SD card, really. Oh, you have the option in Application Manager to ""Move to SD Card"" but because of the way they've made the filesystem, you only have the ILLUSION of the app actually moving. Move an APP and then go look at the SD Card in File Manager, and you find that NOTHING actually moved.Further, some apps (like Amazon Music) which allow for selecting where files should go, only recognize the SD card SOME of the time. Other times, nada. Also, sometime the SD card wouldn't mount, leaving lots of missed apps and files (even though the apps aren't actually ON the SD Card).Last complaint: Wifi reception and speeds were sketchy compared to all the other devices in my house.In the end, I sent this phone back and bought a used Note 4. I guess $250 is just a little TOO LITTLE to charge for a phone."
"Alcatel",4,"First let me tell you that I spend a lot of time reading reviews and on tech sites and am usually the guy in the family that everyone asks for tech advice.After my Nexus 5 screen shattered I was not happy with the state of any of the higher end android phones. They were just too expensive and big. SO after much research i settled on the Idol 3 after reading tons of great reviews.DESIGN: The phone is thin and sleek. I quite like the plastic back. It has a nice feel to it. There's not much flair to the phone but I personally like that. Its a little big and maybe a tad uncomfortable to hold because of how thin is it. The front has two front facing speakers, and there's a notification light up front. The tray that holds the sim card also has a place for you to put in a micro sd card.Camera: Right off the bat I have to tell you that the camera BLEW ME AWAY. In auto mode you get some very good images, but the camera comes in full manual mode that lets you adjust ISO, shutter speed, focus, and white balance. I've gotten some AMAZING images from this phone. Its probably the phone's most under appreciated feature. The camera has other modes, but I almost never touch them.Battery: The battery for me on this phone easily last a day, and with light use will last 2. I can't tell you how nice it is not having to worry if i remembered to pack my charger all the time.Screen: The screen is nice and bright, colors nice and sharp. Its not the sharpest, but its a great screen, and better than most in this price range.Software: The phone comes with almost stock android. The minor changes are generally useful, like letting you restart the phone and put it in airplane mode from the power button (which annoyingly google too out of stock android). Alcatel has not been the best about software updates, but they have been really good about security updates. Since i've own the phone there have been two security updates. This is good! Most cheap phones never even see these.Performance: This is really the only place that the phone falters. Games take a while to open, and if you have too many apps or tabs open, the phone really starts to get sluggish. About once a day I end up closing all apps to release some ram. This generally helps, but sometimes I end up having to restart the phone to get it back. That being said most apps are fine. Apps like facebook or twitter don't have any hang ups.Overall, this phone is such a good value. Except for maybe being a tad too big, and sometimes sluggish performance with more graphic intensive games, this phone is a joy to use. In many ways it best phones costing 3 times as much."
"Alcatel",1,"I got a crappy phone which did not work after one hour of use ."
"Alcatel",3,"The screen is very good and so are the speakers. The battery life is good as well. The phones weakest points are build quality and performance. It became frustrafing to use. The phone itself looks great but the speaker and screen had some movement. It seemed separated."
"Alcatel",5,"I've been using this phone for a month with T-Mobile. I haven't had any problems with it. It has a great display, great sound and great connectivity. It fits well in my hand, call quality is excellent. I also use it with Ooma's app to make calls over wifi and that works great too. You'll need to be an Ooma customer to use that. I put a 128GB micro sd card in it, that's pretty well loaded with video and music. It doesn't seem to drag performance. I moved what apps allow it to the card. It's a great phone if you watch a lot of video whether it's streaming or using internal storage. I had considered the Moto G until I found out it didn't support wireless display. I had doubts about Alcatel, but this phone has turned out to be superb. The only thing I don't like about it is the button and usb port placement."
"Alcatel",4,"Got this to compare with my OnePlus 1 & Asus Zenfone 2 with 4GB. Overall I'm very impressed. Looks wise I'd rate it about equal to the 1 & better than the zenfone 2.Powerwise the Asus & OnePlus both score better than the Idol 3 & yes I to sometimes notice some lag from time to time. The screen & speakers on the Idol 3 are better than both Oneplus 1 way brighter/louder/better than the Zenfone. As the pro reviews have said it isn't easy to see the Zenfone screen in the sun & here in Texas we have a lot of sun. However the Asus is a super game playing device where I'd advise gamers to avoid the Idol 3. It is great with most everyday tasks like e-mail, messaging, phone calls, & web browsing. Camera-wise the OnePlus (esp video) & Asus 1 are a bit better than the Idol 3 but all three, camera-wise are a good bit below the Apple 6 phones or Samsung S6 amoung others, but for their price they're pretty good. Over all I think the OnePlus 1 is slightly better than this Alcatel Idol 3 but the Asus is the best cheap game phone around. Just use a IEM/headphone for games& music with it 'cause the Asus speaker sucks."
"Alcatel",5,"good"
"Alcatel",5,"This is only my own humble review after a week's use after my Sony xperia z3 broke.PROS————Interface is interesting, it has many features, I like the icons and the way the lollipop runs on this phone, screen is big and the colors are good, it runs smooth overall for a 250 dollar phone, I consider it a good substitution for my non-waterproof Sony xperia z3, at a much lower cost, the games run with better performance on this one than in the z3.Sound software is good, and ear buds are much better than the ones that came on my z3, I find it enjoyable to listen to music on my idol 3.It is very light, I haven't dropped it once (which is rare for me) it's design I like more, the camera viewfinder is faster than on the Sony Xperia z3, even though photos are no as good but in relationship to cost/expectation it delivers so much more.CONS————Battery saving modes are nos as good as the xperia's staminas, the battery last a lot although not as I was used to on my older phone. Idol 3 has minor software related bugs (songs stutter every once in a while) volume control is rarely unresponsive and may lag from time to time, sometimes the volume responds but the meter on the screen is unresponsive. Phone may become laggy when more than 5 apps are open, so you have to close them. I haven't found any good cases available for the phone yet, the best one I bought was made out of poor material.Videos don't run as smooth as on my xperia z3.Overall: it is a lot for the price, I can find many pros on this phone over sonys flagship at the time of the review (z3) which costed me more than double the price for this one. It delivers more than expect for money on today's market. So considering that I have to give it a 5 star."
"Alcatel",5,"Great phone for the money. No major complaints, I highly recommend it."
"Alcatel",4,"Coming from a ZTE Z998, this phone is an enormous upgrade, but does have its quirks. There are many features of the phone that are simply great, but I'll cut the chase and get to the dirt:*Phone is a little laggy at time, especially in Google Chrome.*Double tap to Wake rarely works on time. Sometimes takes up from 1 to 3 minutes for the phone to finally come to the lock screen.*Cellular service signal often just quits. Not sure why, but it is kind of annoying.*LTE signal takes quite a while to lock in. Most of the time the signal comes in with H+. This does effect down/upload speeds.*I've found Bluetooth in my car to be a little quirky. Phone doesn't always sync automatically with my car's Bluetooth. Not sure why?*When getting a phone call with a 3.5 mm jack plugged in and Bluetooth also enabled, call goes through or comes in, but parties on the phone can't hear one another. I've looked into the settings, there may be an issue here?Aside from those issues above, which can likely be worked out if Alcatel ever issues an OTA update, the phone is great. Videos and music are crisp and clear. Games are fun to play, very little lag there. The screen is great! For a phone, the audio is fantastic! You can move your apps over to the SD card to save internal memory. Not all the app data is transferable, but being able to move it over does help. I wish there was a way to control where your ""downloads"" save file to, but unfortunately there is not and a download automatically saves to the phone's memory. You have to make a conscious effort to move the file over to the SD card, as to not consume your internal memory. 11 GB's of memory doesn't go too far these days.For the money at $250, this phone is a pretty good buy and worth the money. It is clear however where Alcatel cut some corners to stay in the $250 price range and still make profit. Too bad phones are so throw away after 2 years of use. Guess that's the nature of technology and people always wanting something better. Enjoy the phone!Screen protector and a phone case are a must if you want to preserve any phone for at least 2 years. There aren't too many phone case options for this phone yet thought. :-("
"Alcatel",5,"Excellent value for your dollar and works on AT&T and T-Mobile networks at LTE speeds. Speakers are loud without distortion and screen is bright and clear with good viewing angles."
"Alcatel",4,"I was very lucky I have this Android phone! Its cheap but, it has competetive performance compare to the high end android phone. I did not have a second thought to buy this gadget!"
"Alcatel",4,"I have T-Mobile and it works fantastically. I bought it because I needed a bigger screen (had the Moto G, another great phone) but the screen was too small. Great phone all around."
"Alcatel",5,"Love this phone! I'm not a tech person, but I can absolutely appreciate the value I am getting from this $250 phone. If you don't care about all the speed ratings etc. , which for everyday typical phone use shouldn't make a difference, then I highly recommend checking out this phone."
"Alcatel",5,"I bought this phone for my wife as a replacement for her old one. We both loved it ! It make me wish that I had ordered it for myself. It is a beautiful phone with great features at an incredible price. I am very pleased with this purchase."
"Alcatel",5,"My 1st impression upon opening the box was ""wow, this is gorgeous"". Yes the back is plastic, but the build quality, color, finish and overall design makes it look and feel like a premium product. I was pleasantly surprised at how sturdy yet lightweight it was when I first picked it up. Turning it on made me feel even more wowed. The screen is just gorgeous, probably the best that I've seen. It's sharp, hi-res, great colors, and the GUI and near stock Android experience makes the experience that much better (unlike Samsung or other phones where they have great screens but the GUI ruins the premium feel).There's some lag when I'm going from app to app, but I'd say it is something I can live with, it doesn't happen all the time and closing all the apps seems to remedy this problem. I'm able to play the latest games, and for the most part it's a fast experience.I was worried about the camera from all the reviews and 100% cropped sample images I saw on the web. But actually after several test shots I'm surprised that the photos turned out well. The photos are a little smudgy when zoomed 100%, and low light performance could be better, but when I'm viewing them on FB or just zoomed out on my pc, the photos are very clear, good contrast and decent colors. The quality reminds me of an entry to mid-level point and shoot camera, or an iPhone 4s or 5. I wouldn't zoom in all the way or print these photos that's for sure, but the camera is actually better than what all the reviews online have made it seem (it's a 250 dollar phone for crying out loud).Overall this phone is a steal at 250 bucks. I'm thinking of buying 1 for both my parents. I would not hesitate to buy this at all, and the best part, it's an affordable phone that doesn't look like an iPhone."
"Alcatel",5,"It great 👍"
"Alcatel",5,"I spent three weeks comparing phone specs on gsmarena and I'm very impressed by this phone. It stands up well against the so called ""flagship"" phones. For those looking at $100 phones, my advice would be to save your money and wait until you can buy the Alcatel OneTouch Idol 3 which is very reasonably priced for what it brings to the table. This phone is a very lightly skinned pure Android phone, which Alcatel did such a great job with I no longer need a launcher such as Nova. Over the air updates are also a major plus. The build quality is fantastic. This phone has a metal center body wrapped top and bottom with aluminum or stainless steel bands -- I can't tell which. The top band also wraps over the stereo speakers. The back is textured plastic, which is a must because it wont interfere with the internal antennas. I also like the slide out sim and SD card tray and the full 1080P display. Those things, and much more, are what you would normally pay $1K if you bought a ""flagship"" phone. One word of advice, leave the display brightness on ""auto"" or you'll use too much battery. Other than that, battery life is fantastic no matter how much you use this phone during the day. Alcatel would sell a lot more phones if they'd list more technical features for their phones, and I'm not really sure why they don't. I could write a lot more, but let's suffice to say, I am not easy to please but I am very happy with this phone. Normally I would find something I don't like, but in this case, that didn't happen."
"Alcatel",5,"excellent"
"Alcatel",1,"I would not recommend this phone because it is NOT supported by the manufacturer. There is no support for this phone whatsoever. It's biggest problem is software and there isn't even a FAQ blog to go to. DO NOT BUY THIS PHONE!!!!!!!!!!!!"
"Alcatel",5,"Although the cameras are not the best in the world I cannot be too angry for $250!The screen is super bright and the speakers are front facing and better than my iPhone!Unfortunately the battery will not last you all day in heavy use but again for the price it cannot be beat!"
"Alcatel",5,"A lot of people have suggested that a power user should really go for one of the top tier flagship phones where they don't compromise on CPU, RAM, display etc. I am a software developer and most definitely a power user. I take a lot of time to customize my phone and I use it very heavily and I can say without a doubt, I will never spend $500 on a phone again now that I have seen what $250 can buy.If you know how to manage your memory, this phone is very snappy. I haven't done much in the way of 3D gaming so I can't comment on that but that's not a power user thing. That's a teenager nerd boy thing. If you want a mobile gaming platform for your spoiled brat, you may want to spend more. I for one couldn't imagine spending $600 or more on a phone that will probably get broken in your kids backpack, but that's your call.The display is quite nice, clear, bright colors. The camera is even quite good. The battery could be better but it still lasts me a full day with heavy use. I'm not a big fan of the stock user interface but now that I've loaded Apex Launcher, that's been resolved anyways. There are a ton of launcher options out there and they all offer a better than stock user experience in my opinion. I highly recommend Nova, Apex or Hola Launcher but there are a bunch out there worth exploring. I'm happy with Apex but I like to explore and see what else is possible.Still, if all of that was good but the call quality was bad, this wouldn't not be a positive rating. That was a major concern for me since there are some ratings out there that knock the call quality. I really don't understand professional reviewers on sites like C-Net or PC Mag that give a glowing review of the phone when the one negative is the poor call quality. It's a smartPHONE. The PHONE part should be the most important. Anyways, while it's not the best call quality I've had, it's actually quite good. The only complaint I have about call quality is that I sound a little tin to the user on the other end of the call. They can still hear me clearly, even in a noisy environment and there's no reverb or echo or scratchiness. The sound quality on my end is quite good also, including the speakerphone. Also, I get a better (cell radio) signal with this phone than I did with my T-Mobile HTC One or my unlocked Sony Z3 which means I can make calls in places where I couldn't with those phones and I have less likelihood of having a call dropped.For this price point, it's a fantastic phone. I used to only buy flagship phones for between $500 and $700 and I always felt ripped off (Sony, Samsung, HTC). This is the first phone purchase I've made in the last 7 years that I feel like I got my money's worth (and then some).Bottom line, if you are in the market for a flagship phone, consider what you will actually be using it for. Then consider saving yourself some money."
"Alcatel",5,"I offers more than any other phone alone or together. Speed, look, one can answer in any side. Has an excellent look. Light and thin. A 5.5 display, wide front camera - has a great back camera. On top the Audio Mix - has an excellent crystal sound on 5.1 stereo and great great headphones.On top, it offers more than iPhone 6 on $250. After a day paying with it - a friend of mine - just garbed it from me. Now I have to boy another one :). Currently I have an Idol 2 - but Idol 3 is much more advanced. I recommend it to all."
"Alcatel",5,"Is good."
"Alcatel",4,"The phone is alright but the new update have it kind of buggy and I don't like how they put the charger at the bottom. Also the front facing speakers or up to par when watching videos."
"Alcatel",4,"great"
"Alcatel",4,"I surprised my girlfriend with this phone for Christmas and she loves it. The wasome thing about is,there is very little that this phone won't do. Definitely worth the price and then some. The resolution isn't half bad at all and the interface is very clean and bear stock Android."
"Alcatel",1,"The processor is SUPER SLOW .. the battery life SUCKS .. on a full charge overnight not even 2 hours and it's already near 70% lags a lot and it just annoys me a lot because of how slow and unresponsive it can get. I wouldn't recommend anyone getting this phone if they don't like waiting for their phone to just open a simple messenger app."
"Alcatel",1,"Very unhappy with this phone... I cannot send or receive pictures on message.. Also I cannot delete emails.. It says I'm not connected yet I'm on line... I've talked to my carriers and they say all my settings are correct... I cannot continue to deal with this, I'm pulling my hair out.. I'll be returning this phone as soon as I get another one and get my information off this one."
"Alcatel",5,"So far this phone is awesome. I am using it on Metro PCS. In the metro Detroit area I can generally hit around 70 Mbps all the time. Phone is running fast and not lagging even when using multiple apps. Speakers are super loud. So far I love this phone. Update. After a month of having this phone I have to say I love it. It is everything I want in a smart phone. Great screen. Super bright. Very thin. Awesome battery life. Good speed opening and switching between apps. Love the loud decent sounding front facing stereo speakers. Love being able to use phone in any orientation. Why buy a phone for 200 on contract when I can buy this and not be locked down to a carrier. I would highly recommend this phone to anyone looking for a perfect midrange phone."
"Alcatel",3,"Good phone for the price excellent display and speakers but the processor is little slow"
"Alcatel",1,"Bought 4 wife. She hates it. Non-intuitive. Wifi drops regularly, although the phone reports that it's connected. I've tried troubleshooting it. I hate it too.Troubleshooting answer. Problem was that this phone saves the last IP address of each WiFi. This is sub optimal, because the router isn't using fixed addresses. Win7, Win8, Linux, other Android, and Fire platforms all handled this with no problem.The manual and support site are not useful. We've still got a beef that the phone is often taking screen shots for no apparent reason.I might raise my rating to 1.5, but I'm still in trouble with my wife for buying it for her."
"Alcatel",3,"Good phone overall. Excellent speakers and very user friendly. I've had this phone for about 6 months now. The only problems I see that are major issues are the reception and text message issues. Reception on this phone is extremely spotty. I have my galaxy S5 next to it - sometimes the idol will be on emergency calls only while the S5 has one bar of 4G LTE. The text messages will come in out of order sometimes. Also, group texts revert to a 1970 date and fall to the very bottom of the text queue. Also, the lag on this phone is noticeable with textsBecause of these major issues, I would likely not buy again."
"Alcatel",4,"The positive 5-star reviews are accurate, and overall this is a great quality phone for the price. Everything works well.However, after having used it for some months, then trying out an HTC m7 with a 4.7 inch screen, I wish I had gone with the 4.8inch version of the Alcatel oneTouch Idol. While readability and viewing videos from a distance is nice, the 5.5"" screen is too clumsy, too difficult to hold in one hand, and too long to fit in a pocket. It just scares me. I live in fear that it will grow too big for me to safely control anymore, and one day it will take over my life.It is also incredibly slippery without a case. More points off for handle-ability. I think they grease the backside with Crisco. This, combined with the clumsy size, makes it super easy to slip out of your hand.Even with the case (I bought here: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00ZOER95Q?psc=1&redirect=true&ref_=oh_aui_search_detailpage) it is difficult to keep in one place. It's a slippery fish just waiting to flop around and escape your grasp to fulfill its secret plans of world domination."
"Alcatel",3,"Good enough phone at a price that can't be beat."
"Alcatel",2,"Phone stopped working and won't turn on in less than one year, vendor (Good guys) say their warranty is only 90 days, now trying to deal directly with Alcatel. This is what you get for not buying reputable brands like Samsung, Apple, etc... Will never buy Alcatel again."
"Alcatel",4,"It's been about a year since I've had this phone and I would buy it again if the new version wasn't out. For those interested in this phone it is under $100 here on Amazon. I find that a great price for a beginner smart phone or for a person who isn't interested in all the bells and whistles of a $700 phone. This thing gets the job done for me running on Android 6.0.1. Ok now for the reason why I gave it 4/5 stars. The phone battery gets warm to the touch under heavy use like watching videos which causes it to kind of feel sluggish. The camera is weak under low light conditions but that didn't bother me since I rarely used the camera. Video quality is alright in clear conditions but like the camera I had no use for that feature. Finally battery life is not that great if you find yourself away from an outlet. Good thing it charges fast. I could go into other features but it really is just a phone for me to keep in touch with family and work. One final thing. The up front dual speakers make listening to music fun. No more cupping the speaker to redirect the sound!"
"Alcatel",1,"This phone seemed ok at first.Out of nowhere the power button started shorting out, if pressed the phone would turn back on like it was stuck...electrical problem not physical though.Few weeks later SD slot failed.I've been on hold with Alcatel trying to do a return for the last 45 minutes, this company and their products seems pretty bad.-Followup, phone volume button automatically starts increasing volume, shorting similar to the power button. This turns the display on and causes the battery to drain quickly.When the battery fully drains the phone doesn't turn on even at full charge, it has to be overcharged for another hour before it turns on. Had to charge mine 10 hours last time battery complete drained before it would turn back on.The person who said this review is not helpful was probably a shill working for this crap company."
"Alcatel",5,"Awesome!! I haven't had any problems with it. Nice screen and speakers. The camera is great for the price, good colors and all of that. Only one thing it does get a little warm but cools fast"
"Alcatel",1,"Crashes and reboots frequently. In Whatsapp, it hangs when viewing an image... slow. Screen already has a break without dropping it, and it has a rubber protector. Worst, a hairline break on the screen has made the keyboard useless, can't return phone... it's dead in only 35 days...I made a mistake buying it..."
"Alcatel",4,"So far so good. Great screen and not too slow"
"Alcatel",1,"I am very disappointed with this purchase. I have been using the phone for less than 2 weeks and I am very close to flushing it down the toilet! Within a few days of using it, i noticed it started freezing for hours on end and only a battery pull can resolve that temporarily.... Please note that I have only ever downloaded one app and that's whatsapp. About the 5th day of using the phone, I noticed that it began shutting down on its own, sometimes it restarts, most times it doesn't. Another issue is that the wifi keeps turning off on its own or just jumping off the internet. Also, the mobile data also spontaneously turns off by itself. Yes, that's 4 issues in just about 12 days of owning this phone. It has now become the bane of my existence! I am so frustrated with this phone, they don't even deserve 1/16th of a star! I will never purchase this phone ever again and I wouldn't want it even if I was being gifted one! I will also warn everyone I know not to purchase this phone, for the statisfaction they will receive from the reasonable price will surely be negated shortly thereafter with the range of issues that this phone has. I guess I will just have to dig deeper and purchase a more reliable phone that will undoubtedly cost me 4 times than what I paid for this, I felt like I wasted my $200. I am certain of one thing, an Alcatel phone will never be brought into my home again! People be warned.... Don't waste your energy, money or time, just save until you can get a better phone, one with warranty and some accountability on the company's part and most importantly never purchase a phone over Amazon. I am totally dissatisfied with the entire purchase as I also never received the Mr. shield screen protector and when I contacted them they told me to contact Amazon! I should have known this was a raw deal and returned everything! Alas, this will never ever happen again. Worst purchase ever!"
"Alcatel",1,"After about 7 years of iphones (3/4/5), this was my first Android, and I was initially thrilled because it was cheap and large and seemed to work well.That ended after about two months, when it started lagging and/or crashing constantly. I was resetting 2-3 or more times every day, and it became near useless. I reinstalled and wiped multiple times and nothing improved it. The camera is also very very poor compared to an iphone and even some other Androids. Fortunately it got stolen from me after about 4 months, so I had an excuse to buy a new phone."
"Alcatel",1,"Reboots by itself 4 Times/ Hangs up calls 4 times"
"Alcatel",5,"Excellent product!!!!!! i recomend it 100%"
"Alcatel",5,"I'm using this phone 3 weeks now and so far have no complains. I'm not a power user which menas mostly web browsing, Viber, messaging, phone calls etc. My sone downloaded some quite demanding games on it and all were running with no issues. The device is always on WiFi or LTE and I can get a 1.5 days from it easily (4.5 hours SOT).There are some intermittent lags I notice but not really significant. Most of the times the phone is very responsive.I like very much how it looks and it's screen size and quality.My previous phone was Nokia Lumia 830 which had very good rear camera but do not feel this phone is a step back.Overall for 160$ on Amazon this was a very good deal. Hopefully it'll carry at least an year and more."
"Alcatel",5,"Needed a new phone since I broke the screen on my new galaxy 5 in the first 2 months I owned it. I read the reviews and ordered the Idol 3 since it was cheaper than replacing the screen and digitized on the Samsung. I just hoped for the best, and can honestly say I was very pleasantly surprised. The phone looks, feels and operates like a quality product. I like it and its features better than the Samsung. I have had it about a week and could not be more satisfied. We'll see how it goes, but as of now I highly recommend this phone."
"Alcatel",1,"It didn't work. Had a mind of its own. I need to send it back! This was my 2nd one.It did the same thing. I've sworn off Alcatel for good."
"Alcatel",5,"Nice phone for what I paid (99). I'd much rather pay this price whenever my phone breaks then paying 600-800 for another phone!Overall good buy. Works well, has nice features."
"Alcatel",5,"Guys excellent phone than moto g play all with jbl speakers and headphones just buy first and than see the magic good budgeted phone just for 99 dollars"
"Alcatel",5,"I bought this phone for 99dollars .for 99 dollars its a decent phone . If it costs more than 99 dollars I would send it back . I picked it up for a back up phone. I decided to give it a test drive. This phone isn't very powerful . I am going to give a review on what's important to me. 1. Signal. It's allover the place fading in from full bars to no bars of LTE . I discovered if I put it in hspa it's fairly stable . In areas that have a great LTE Signal It's fantastic. 2. Call quality. It's middle of the road not great , not horrible. The moto g4 plus is way better , but the g4 has VOLTE . The idol 3 doesnt.3, battery , it's a little better than okay . If I don't use it , it will last . If I do use it it is just like every other phone .4. Responsiveness. I have a galaxy s7 edge . I am used to touchwiz lag . This phone lags as much as my Samsung . I did change the settings in developer options. 5. Screen ..not bad its fairly bright. 6. Storage it's been updated to 6.1,1. It now has adaptive storage . Buy a good SD card if you are going to use it as adaptive storage.7. Size for 5.5 it feels pretty small and very light. I put a glass screen protector on and my favorite slim case. It feels and looks pretty nice.8. Emails and text they work well. I think if t-mobile didn't force Alcatel to disable band 12 (or if Alcatel paid for band 12 license this review would be better. All in all if you can grab it for 99$ do it. But for more go with the honor 5x or moto g4 . For some reason I like this phone .its over a year old now and still a decent performer ."
"Alcatel",5,"I have never owned a smartphone because I am always near a computer or a family member with a smartphone. On a recent trip, I was amazed at how useful their phones were during our travel (Uber, Lyfte, AirBNB, Airline information, Maps) and decided I would get ready for my contract renewal in a few months, by getting a cheap smartphone and loading it up, via WIFI connection at home. Read the reviews and this one was priced at $99. Why not? It's been a week, and it has been eye-opening. It's replacing my clip on MP3 player, cause it plays MP4s as well. The sound is incredible. I have a 64 GB microSD with all my music, that I hot swap into the phone's dual slide. The slide has space for a microSD and a SIM card. I enjoy the built-in radio, Skyping, and using Viber on my WIFI. I've got apps to read Word and Excel documents, my G-mail updates...it goes on and on. It does take around 20 seconds to boot to a visible screen once you press the on button, and I think that may fool many into thinking the phone isn't working, as they repeating hit the on/off button. Just push on, and have patience. The OS also rebooted several times over the first few days, but after a week, that has finally stopped. Camera takes good pictures but not great. It's been fun, and I haven't even activated my phone yet. Once I do, and probably with Cricket, which uses AT&T towers, everything should be ready and I won't have a learning curve."
"Alcatel",3,"This phone is very slow. Want to navigate somewhere? Well, it might take 3 minutes to load your directions. It also sends and receives group messages from 1970. Very inconvenient because they come in at the bottom your message inbox. It also broke after 6 months. I would not buy this item again! In fact, I despite the money lost I am relived that it broke."
"Alcatel",5,"I just love it and it was a big deal!!! :D"
"Alcatel",5,"this was a great deal at $99. Most reviews don't mention the fact that it as facial recognition and iris scanner as an option to unlock it too. That's something iPhone 7 doesn't even have. I use mine with a magnetic holder in my car with no case necessary since the magnet sticks to where the battery is. Not many other phones do that. The reversible feature is cool too. All the reviews on youtube say it's a great deal at $249. There is no other 5.5"", HD, microSD expandable android phone out there nearly this good at anywhere near this price."
"Alcatel",5,"Great phone. I Upgraded from the Moto G LTE which was $220. The difference is night and day in terms if performance. Everything opens super quick and it almost never lags. The camera is great so far (especially the manual mode). Cheap phones are getting better and better each year. Battery life is great as well."
"Alcatel",5,"I try and test new phones all the time. This phone easily won me. Beautiful hardware with very light tweaks to Android where they actually make sense. Alcatel is an underdog now and underdogs work hard and put great offers. This is a clearly one.Specifications wise, I won't recommend this for a serious gamer as there is a noticeable lag after opening many apps. The battery is good. The drive space is small but expandable. The camera and speakers are also premium and surprising."
"Alcatel",5,"I felt like I should write a review on this as a ""average"" phone user.I am a tech guy and have worked in IT for over 15 years, but I don't have to have the best of the new phones. I use mine for mail constantly, browsing 10 or so times a day, usually just to look something up quickly at home. Facebook at night a few times maybe, every once in a while games, but usually just basic stuff like Spades or backgammon, every once in awhile some ""better"" game. Maybe 50 texts a month on average.On to the phone, keep in mind I am coming from a Razr MI ordered 2 of these to replace to Razr M's on Verizon and we were switching over to Cricket wireless so perfect time for this phone to release.Setup - super easy, Turned on the phone, picked my language, setup my wireless connection, and it let me know there was a 50+mb update. Took like 3 seconds to download it and then it installed and rebooted,It then prompted me to setup or transfer my account, I figured hey transfer it, it told me to put my old phone back to back and seconds later my account had transferred over.The screen is huge compared to what I am used to, and very bright, I have it on auto-adjust but it's usually around 20% brightness, it is so bright.I don't use my phone while walking to text or do Facebook etc. but I have checked notifications outside, no problems reading in sunlight. Colors look fine to me, at least for what I need.Audio is pretty loud, the dual stereo speakers are more than what I would expect out of my phone.If I want to share a YouTube video with someone we both have no problems hearing it play.Web browsing, I have had no real problems or lag as some others seem to have had, but I do limit what I browse to on my phone, I don't go to some of the sites that have tons of ads etc. on my phone. I have no problems with slickdeals or dealnews like some people have mentioned.Wi-Fi speed is awesome on mine, I am on 5G in my house and it's so much faster than my old phone or my laptops. It's actually just as fast as my main rig on a wired connection. Every test I have run is over 55mb down and 6mb up and I am on a 50/5 plan. For me it's very fast as tested by Ookla on multiple servers.Data speed, I don't use much as I am on wireless at home and at work, but I have had 4gLTE everywhere I have checked it and I am in Northern Idaho which doesn't have near the same coverage as say Seattle.I haven't had any problems with any apps installing or crashing.Actually I have several apps that seem to work a lot better.Fitbit, and Yamaha AV Controller for example work so much better and quickerBluetooth is great, synced to my car easier than my last 2 phones did, has extra security on ""trusted"" devices for both Bluetooth and Wi-Fi devices.Supports USB and Wi-Fi tethering, both of which I will probably never use.I have a 64gb SD card in mine and the limited access I have used it for has been fine.Reversible mode works and is neat to show people, but I like most people will usually pick up my phone the right way, but it makes handing your phone to someone else easier if you want to show them something.Tap to wake - this is discussed a lot, works fine every time for sleep, but it does seem like some app installs make it wonky. If I go back into gestures and turn it off and then turn it back on it seems to fix the problem.Not all apps break it, but I have had it happen twice now.I don't have a problem with the power button on the left, fine by me, better than on the top like some phones.Included apps don't bother me at all, and lollipop seems to run fine on my phone.Some people have had problems etc. but anyone who has been around tech knows, all companies, all products, ship bad batches.Phone is very light but I am getting used to it already, I have it in a case which has made it not seem so fragile anymore.Overall I really like the phone and for $200 pre-ordered I am more than happy. Plus I used turbo-tax this year so bonus Amazon gift-cards paid for mine.As for the camera, I haven't used it yet, I take pictures on family outings etc. but haven't had the chance yet.Plus if I know I am going somewhere I will want to take pictures ahead of time I am going to take my DSLR.I honestly don't care what the camera is like on my phone to be honest, but the little I have seen will be fine for my needs.I paid more for each of my lenses on my DSLR then I did for this phone, so what do I expect right?There are some other things I could talk about, but that is the gist of what I am going to use the phone for.Update:7:00 a.m. 5/28 took it off the charger - 10:18 p.m. 5/29 44% left on the battery after 2 days of use, several phone calls and 6 trips in the car synced to the car.Also should note you can go into the specifics of the battery and view Wi-Fi and network strength as well as screen-on time for the entire time broken down by the hour since last charged.At this rate I could make it almost 2 more days before running out of battery.Also should note I have the notification LED off and the notification tone set to only go off once when something comes in.Update 6/3 I took my wife's off the charger 5/28 and she has used it mildly since then. She has been home a few of the days, but still uses it everyday a little. As of 9:00 last night phone was at 50%. Pretty dang good. Keep in mind my old Razr M had to be charged halfway through the day at this point due to shortened battery life. So being able to go for days is so nice. I went 4 days on my last charge as well. But I didn't make it to 6 like the wife did.Still enjoying the phone, I still cannot believe how much better all my apps work on the new phone compared to on KitKat.Update 7/13 For those that were asking 52 days, just got upgraded to 5.0.2 today on the firmware. So they are updating pretty well since it's product launch time hasn't even been 2 months and they already have 2 updates plus dealing with all the BS from a product launch so overall I would say pretty good.Still love the phone, I would say the battery life is a little shorter than I first thought but I think it's because it works so well I find myself using it a lot more than I used to use my old phone.Still a great value for the money for me."
"Alcatel",4,"Overall this phone is a good value for money. I personally believe most of the current very ""few"" issues are due to buggy lollipop not the hardware of this phone. Battery life and Screen can beat the crap out of any phone on market. I dont think its a sluggish phone by any sense. A little hiccup here and there is okay for a normal user. I tried playing few games as well , could not find any lag. For $200 its equal to any phone which is right now for $400"
"Alcatel",5,"If you are in the market for a smartphone (even if your not) and you're thinking $600-700 for the one that has the features you want, look no further. If you don't take advantage of the Alcatel one touch idol 3 for $249.00 including free shipping, you will be missing out on the best deal going right now. Why buy a V12, when a V8 will do the job just fine and looking very stylish too. I've had mine a few days and it does everthing it says in all the videos and reviews and very well I think. Save some money! Isn't that what it's all about."
"Alcatel",1,"Out of the box, the phone already had problems. During setup the phone developed a serious error that could only be resolved by doing a factory reset. I used the phone for 4 days after doing the factory reset, pretty happy with its performance. But then this morning I went to turn it on for the first time - black screen. Tried holding down the power button for several seconds, nothing. Tried doing a factory reset, nothing. Since the battery is not removable, there's nothing to be done now except send it back. It's really too bad that I waited 5 weeks for this phone to come out and in the first week it already turned out to be a piece of junk. Super disappointed."
"Alcatel",5,"A very solid phone for the asking price.I was able to purchase this device during promotion for 199 dollar, but in this review i will compare to the Mate 2, Note 4 and Nexus 4, iphone5, which at the time of my purchase was 300 dollar, 750 dollar, 360 dollar and 600 dollar. I'd like to mention that the asus zenfone 2 is a very capable phone and priced at 199/299, but i do not have a unit to compare with.pro1. build quality is superb. the phone is assembled with high precision, the unit is very thin and very solid. the entire phone has no creaking when pressed and each button has very nice tactile feel. it is very similar to the feeling of Nexus 4, which was also superb in term of build quality and overall finishing.2. the speaker is superb. it is up there with HTC boomsound and i think it might actually better at bass (HTC may be better at treble). at any rate. the speaker is miles apart from anything else and even better than most tables (that includes ipad). the true stereo speaker and high definition sound (for a phone) really helps when you watch video or play game without headphones or boombox. and most importantly, this phone's speaker are very well placed and it hides within the frames. so all the glory without HTC's huge ugly speaker grills.3. screen is awesome. it has one of the brightest screen on a phone. no issue to use in the day light and it is capable of display vivid images at a extreme wide angle. it easily rivals the screen found on iphone 5. in the realm of IPS, this screen is as good as it goes. (but i still prefer the ALMOED on Note 4 better for its deep contrast).4. stock andriod. pretty much the vanilla andriod with very little touch to add alcatel's reversible screen. which means very little overhead and smooth operation.5. support SD card. while most say SD card is useless, i would not purchase a device without capability of expanding storage. i often travel for business and leisure. and many place i go does not have cellphone reception or in an country that cell data is very slow. I always keep the Here map and its offline data in my phone in case i need direction, and that's a good 15 to 20G of data all by itself. and if one uses the phone to take photo or video, he/she will use few gig of storage in a week or two. bottom line, after 9 month of using Note 4, i have already exhausted the 64G SD card and just moved to 200G SD card. and having SD card on a phone, even if you don't think you need it, is a big plus to me.average1. camera is very average for 2015 flagship phone (but very good for 2013 standard). the only other phone i have at the time of the photo comparison is Note 4, which was released in 2014 but has one of the very best camera in smart phone at the time of this review. compared with Note 4, the onetouch idol lacks resolution, white balancing and image sharpness in pretty much any lighting condition. However, i would say that Idol3 does perform very well compared to the flagship phone from two generations ago (e.g. iphone5, Galaxy S4). do bear in mind that this phone does not have a sticking out camera housing like the latest smart phones, and this phone is VERY thin (7.4 mm compared with iphone 5's 7.6 mm). it's optics will suffer even with a capable CMOS sensor.2. performance. again, this phone would have no problem when compared with flagship phones from two generations ago (like HTC M7, S4 or iPhone 5) and might even be slightly faster. which is to say that phone is perfectly capable for daily tasks such as reading email, browsing web or play games (even the very intensive games like implosion). you would probably see occasion lag when scrolling through a huge PDF file or some complicated websites, or a longer loading time for games, but not a deal breaker in my mind. it is not until you doing transcoding or running benchmarks will you see the huge difference between current gen flagship and this phone, but who dose transcoding in the phone anyways?3. reception. in the same location, this phone's reported reception is always about 11 to 15 dbm lower than the Note 4. which would technically translate to 20% of signal strength (since the highest is probably -60 dbm if you standing right next to the tower and lowest usable cell phone strength is around -125).4. compromises: with such wonderful design and display, there are sacrifices has to be made for this release price. for one thing: you don't have 802.11 ac, you don't have Magnetometer or a Gyroscope, all of which zenfone 2 has for similar and cheaper MSRP (199). while i do miss the magnetometer and gyroscope for fast location and direction. i do not miss the 802.11 ac feature. the ac allows you to transfer files at a much greater speed (about twice as fast compared to n in my test with computers), but this is completely useless because the phone's internal storage is so slow that it doesn't matter how fast you can pull down the data. at least on my Note 4, the transfer rate doesn't seem to have any difference when running ac or n.4. processor: i am not against weak processors and i have said this processor does do it job. BUT the 615 is just gimmicky. technically with its octa core, it should be little-big design that you have two cluster of computing units, one is fast but power hungry (A57/A15) while another (A53/A7) is slow but power efficient. but in this device, you have 8 A53 core, just one cluster is clocked faster. REALLY??? qualcomm has no reason to not just release it with standard 4core A53s and add a speed governor to achieve the same effect. in fact, qualcomm said themselves that 615 was released due to market demand for more cores not due to power efficiency or performance. i'd much rather see a 801 or intel's core in this phone than 615 for the similar price.overall, a very solid phone that actually have a good design. it is one of those product that doesn't do all the justice just by reading the spec sheet. you have to see it in person and feel it in hand to appreciate its craftsmanship and balanced performance. while not perfect, it does have a lot of merit for its price tag even at 250 USD. This"
"Alcatel",1,"I decided to put down my big name flagship for a bit, and was pleasantly surprised.This device boasts a bright (even on low) large screen, decent processor, Android Lollipop, front facing speakers, good battery life, and LTE band 12 that I need on T-Mobile. And that whole package comes in at an insanely low price.It's not as fast as my Oneplus One's 801 processor, but overall I'll take front facing speakers and better LTE over minimal processor speed gains. It is an octacore 64 bit, so it's no snail, it can compete with any big name device. IMHO the speed races are over, and software/hardware optimization is key, which Alcatel did a great job.Oh and this brings JBL headphones, it's rare that any OEM puts accessories with devices now, some don't even include chargers.Software wise, it's very much Vanilla like. The screen rotates no matter which way you turn it, it adjusts to you. Also, you can double tap to wake AND to sleep. It's the simple things that I love. And since it's running on Snapdragon, you won't have compatibility issues (Intel) or slow downs (Mediatek).Ultimately I was too used to my Oneplus customizations so the OPO called back to me. But if I didn't have my old flagship killer, this would be my phone. I'm recommending this device to everyone!*UPDATE*I had the device in a case, and screen protector. It suffered its first drop, from hands, and the screen shattered. Be VERY CAREFUL.Also, I plan on getting a tempered glass protector once I get it back.In case I run into any issues on RMA I'm paying for, I'll update.*UPDATE 2Really expensive repair service. $39.99 triage fee charged whether you get it repaired or not, if you don't pay it you don't get your phone back.+$54 for a screen replacementI'm done with Alcatel"
"Alcatel",5,"I caught this during their pre-release. At the time I was thinking about replacing my cracked screen Note 2. My phone was still functional, but it has been a couple years. Since the Note 5 should be released soon, I purchased this inexpensive phone in the interim. I wasn't expecting so much, other than it to hold me over.Pulling it out of the packaging, immediately, it felt slim and light. Almost light to the point of cheapness. That feeling has gone away since, now I appreciate how slick and light weight it is.I fired it up, the screen looks beautiful. Bright, with great color too. Turned it back off, inserted my sim card and sd card. That was a bit cumbersome compared to previous phones that I have had, but given the slim nature of the design, it may have been a necessity. After getting it all setup, and navigating around a bit, I found it pretty snappy. I downloaded my normal apps, and installed Aviate, the launcher which I have been using since beta and find very clean.If you're coming from 4.x Android or another OS, you won't have the small gripes that I have. I had installed Cyanogenmod 12.1 on my note 2 before switching to this phone and there are quite a few features I miss from that version. These are minor, and in no way have a significant negative affect on how I like this phone. The fact you can use the phone, or any app upside down is a neat idea, but in practice, your buttons are in the wrong spot, and it still feels upside down. The camera seems good, but I am no camera expert, and only take pictures from time to time.Over the past week or so, here is what I found that stands out:Good:Front facing speakersScreen quality, bright and detailedLight weight*** PRICE *** I doubt you'll find anything close in this price range, rivals $500+ phones imoBattery lifeCall quality via hand set, speaker phone and bluetoothNot so good:Not a lot of case optionsOther notes that may affect your purchase decision:Charging port position is off center, awkward, and may interfere with some cradlesPower button feels like it is in the wrong spotNon-removable battery, may be no issue, I haven't ever replaced a battery in my other phones, and I expect one to last at least a couple years which is fine to me.Bottom line for me:I was surprised how good this phone is. Initially it was supposed to be temporary, but I will keep it until I break it. Good phone, crazy awesome price! Unless you want the specific name brand, buy this, you won't be sorry.6/3/15Updated observations:When in a phone call, the screen doesn't rotate, even when just using bluetooth. This causes a small issue when I want to go from a phone call to using navigation software since I want the landscape view. As soon as the call hangs up, it rotates how it should.I had one random reset, of course this was while I was navigating downtown Seattle and needed to know my next turn.I took the time to watch video on this, and the audio is AWESOME!Battery life is definitely acceptable for me, not the best or worst. It lasts me more than all day though with moderate use.There is a feature that can be turned on that allows you to tap twice to turn on/off the screen, that does not work so well.7/7/15Ended up with a very small scratch on the screen, probably from my keys, so if you pick this up, get a screen protector.Still overall a five star purchase to me!"
"Alcatel",1,"Stay away from Alcatel products. They do not do updates but when they do it us not for your benefit. The only real update was forced onto the idol 3 phone and it removed band 12 from the phone. This is a BIG deal if you use TMobile. Alcatel advertised it band 12 capable, it is now not."
"Alcatel",5,"works great had to do factory reset as soon as i got it"
"Alcatel",1,"Garbage! Stay away. Work for like 5 months. Lcd stop working. I had to pay 10 dollars and one week without phone to send to alcatel.Two months later power button stop working. Physically its fine but i guess electrical"
"Alcatel",5,"This phone ' is awsome. BRIGHT, FAST, AND LIGHT!! AWSOME!!!"
"Alcatel",5,"This is great for a budget phone. Gorgeous display. If you are on the fence about this phone, just go ahead and get it. Can't go wrong for 250 bucks."
"Alcatel",5,"Awesome phone just as I expected per reviews I have read. Battery is great, and no bloat ware."
"Alcatel",5,"Total upgrade to my Moto G 2014.Great phone, great price, unbelievable deal!"
"Alcatel",5,"Love it and you can't beat the price. Anyone who pays 2-3 times this price for a smart phone is missing out."
"Alcatel",1,"Sim tray is a problem to use with a nano SIM card adapter ."
"Alcatel",5,"Simply the BEST budget smartphone out there now even better then the Motorola Moto G! This phone is packed with features like tap to wake, Android 5.0.2 a reversible hand set the can be used even upside down and has 4G LTE for all Gsm carries such as T-Mobile and AT&T.. So what are you waiting for a must buy smartphone for 2015!"
"Alcatel",3,"Not a bad phone, but not a great one.Out of the box it's pretty quick, but after installing a few apps a and a little use it slows way down.The pictures and video are good, but the poor placement of the camera lens takes some getting used to, I had a lot of shots with the edge of my finger in them.It's very light and thin which is good and bad.Good because, well, it's light and thin.Bad because, being made of plastic and that light, it feels very cheap.I like the fact that it's a mostly stock interface with some customization.If you're thinking of this phone I would (and did) spend $50 more dollars and get the Asus Zenfone 2.. it's lightyears ahead of this phone (in terms of performance) and only a little bit more.The photos and video on the Idol 3 are very slightly better, but everything else on the Zenfone 2 is better."
"Alcatel",1,"if u have no ther option, then u better stay with no phone. Days 1 thru 3 were good. Then everything went downhill. The phone lags, it stutters, it freezes to the point where it begins to get hot and it locks up. The phone did feel ok in the hand. oh yeah and the speakers were good."
"Alcatel",5,"Can't beat this phone for the price! I replaced my Samsung Galaxy S5 and haven't looked back.My only complaint is the lack of removable battery, but luckily that hasn't been an issue yet."
"Alcatel",5,"Great deal for price. Thin, great battery life, sharp and bright screen. This not a low end phone as price would suggest. You can get half a dozen of these for the price of an Iphone. My wife has had one for a year with no issues so I replaced my Fire phone with one to get the larger screen. Fire phone still has the best interface. Wish Amazon had keep up development on it"
"Alcatel",5,"This is the second one I purchased, one for each parent. Since the price had dropped significantly it was a steal. At under $200 this phone is a solid buy. So far it's up to Marshmallow, and has a great screen, great performance, and amazing dual front facing speakers. Battery like is solid and the added benefit of expandable storage with a very stock interface (after adding the Google launcher) are an added bonus. The only issue with this phone is the camera. It's slow, and in medium to low light blurring does occur. I expect this from a phone at this price, but if you have decent light and steady hands you can take average photos."
"Alcatel",5,"First things first, this phone is HUGE! I love it! I am so glad this isn't a flagship phone either for two reasons.1. The price! This phone is exactly the same software and hardware as $400+ phones the memory/RAM may just be better!2. Because it isnt a flagship there isnt any ""forced"" signing into your personal email, google or other accounts. Pop a sim card in and you're good to go!Now to the phone itself, the video display is amazing so crisp and clear. I tend to have my phone in the lowest brightness setting all the time to preserve battery life and the video is still amazing.The pictures and videos the phone take are to cool, I love the time lapse that saves as a video file. My wife has the same phone and loves using Snapchat with it, even though there is no front flash.I like playing games on mine and the size of this thing makes it so easy, because the ram is so good there is no lag/freezing. It's now almost 2017 and I can download and play all the modern day apps and games extremely well. including pokemon GO. This camera will work with pokemon GO as well."
"Alcatel",5,"Great value for an unlocked phone. Sound and screen both are great. Using on AT&T network in Texas."
"Alcatel",5,"Bien"
"Alcatel",1,"The bottom half of the screen stopped working and will not respond to touch. I guess you get what you pay for??"
"Alcatel",5,"Incredible phone for the price, very pleased with purchase"
"Alcatel",3,"Beautiful well performing android. Processor is quick, takes decent pictures, and display is very nice. However, the home button stopped working after 11 months of use. Now, cannot let the phone go into sleep mode or let the battery die because it won't come back on."
"Alcatel",5,"Everything I had hoped for.Fantastic phone for the money.The music quality is excellant."
"Alcatel",4,"Its has been a decent phone since I bought it. There are some quirks with the messaging app, like it will show a message in bold that has been read if the person is also in a multi-person message and responds; even when both messages have been read. The camera is not that great for photos or videos inside. Reception on T-Mo and ATT have been fine. WIFI and BT have worked without problems also. Definitely worth the pre-order price."
"Alcatel",5,"Excellent phone for a good price. Already has received an update for Stagefright while lots of high end flagship phones haven't."
"Alcatel",5,"It is big, which works well with my big hands. It's cheap, it's responsive and had a great looking screen. It can finally be rooted, so I'm keeping an eye out on development for this phone. I've dropped it plenty of times and the screen hasn't cracked. Maybe that has to do with the LK TPU case I have on it. The software and timely updates have made the phone better. Good camera and speakers. It has band 12 for Tmobile LTE. Unlocked for any carrier.My issues with it are the button placement for power and volume. The power button should have been placed halfway down the phone instead of right across from the volume buttons. I often trigger a screenshot when i just wanted to turn the screen off. As time goes on I am getting used to the placement and I make those errors less often. Also, the double tap to sleep/wake up is not always responsive. I try a few times, and then I end up having to push the power button to wake up the phone (which is what I would have done anyway if there was no tap to sleep feature). Overall very happy with this phone."
"Alcatel",5,"This phone is really nice for the money. The front facing speakers and the dragontail screen are what originally sold me on the phone, as these features are really hard to find on phones with higher price tags. The screen is so smooth and very responsive. The weight and balance is just right, so you feel like you got something for your money. Yes, there is some bloatware but, there are some good apps to remove what you don't want. The JBL headphones that come with this phone are a nice added bonus. Packaging is very nice also. Alcatel really hit the mark with this one. Let's just hope they keep up. The only bad which may not be bad for everyone, is the reversal of the on/off and volume buttons. I would fire the engineer that threw that in the suggestion box. Overall I really like this phone and wouldn't trade mine for an iphone or samsung..."
"Alcatel",1,"The best mid range smart phone on the market. Bought this for my mother-in-law and its been an amazing performer. Great display..camera..size..she absolutely loves it.Update: 11-20-2016Just purchased another of these phones in September to replace the original one because the screen was broken. One morning a week ago my mother- in- law woke up and the phone no longer works. It's about a month past the return date and the phone is now being sold for almost twice what we paid for it. If a new battery doesn't fix this dead phone issue we r sick with a new phone that doesn't work."
"Alcatel",4,"Great phone for a great price. I love the hardware. The Alcatel UI could use some work. Very crude and not sleek."
"Alcatel",5,"Great phone. Easy to navigate. Good battery life. I love it."
"Alcatel",1,"After a week with the phone it just exploded in my pocket I returned it any bought the way better one plus one."
"Alcatel",5,"I switched to the Idol 3 from a Galaxy Note 2, haven't looked back ever since. For the price, you can't beat this phone. The screen is bright and clear. The dual speakers are loud and make watching videos or listening to music really enjoyable. I love the placement of the speakers on the front. The camera is ok. Pictures are great during the day time with abundant light. However night and low light pictures are a bit grainy. Having said that, there are phones that cost more with worse cameras. Is this better than an iPhone 6 or Galaxy S6? No, but are those phones worth 3X the price? Heck no.Bottom line: This phone cannot be beat for the price."
"Alcatel",5,"A very cool design, awsome layout, and good quality for a really fair price. The only problem with the phone that I've had is with putting in the SD card and SIMs card in and phone will reboot itself sometimes but all is good for how much it is"
"Alcatel",5,"Pleasing device. Smooth transition from Galaxy Note 3. Too easily snap screen shots due to my clumsy grip. Great reception. Sharp screen. Recommend second to Galaxy family of phones."
"Alcatel",5,"I'll never buy a ridiculously expensive phone again! Hopefully they keep producing this quality at a reasonable price. I'm just an average daily user and I've found no fault at all with this device."
"Alcatel",5,"Absolutely love this phone. Using on T-Mobile and binge on. Great screen and love the FORWARD facing speakers. Highly recommend!"
"Alcatel",5,"I have had other phones (Moto G 1st and 2nd generation, Moto E) but the Alcatel OneTouch Idol 3 is by far the best one that I have used. I enjoy using this phone, compared to the others that I have owned. I would recommend this phone to anyone."
"Alcatel",5,"I ordered this cellphone as a gift for a family member that was in need for a much needed cellphone.The family that received this cellphone was overjoyed when they unwrapped the box. It was a birthday gift to a family member. The phone is a great size phone that was bigger than what I expected , this phone has great features and was easy for me to set up for that family member, and I had no problem with this phone ,this phone will last for a long time for this family member. Overall this is a great phone. Disclaimer : I purchased this on my own personal behalf, and opinions are 100% of my own."
"Alcatel",5,"100 % Recomendable"
"Alcatel",1,"Don't buy if you use T-Mobile or there 4g towersAlcatel removed band 12 without warning. And they won't help me contacted several times ."
"Alcatel",3,"The only drawback is that the Alcatel phone that claims to have 16 GB of internal storage, when I check the drive settings - storage, I find myself having only 10.95 GB of internal storage , in other words it was not 100% described the product sales , I get discouraged a little."
"Alcatel",1,"I have 2 void stickers on my so called new phone. Does that mean I'm not covered by warranty the box looks open"
"Alcatel",5,"Bought this phone when it first came out and was surprised on how high quality it actually is. The phone is not the fastest, but that didn't disappointed me considering the low price. Besides the great screen, the two front facing speakers are loud and clear. A lot better than some high end phones. The camera is pretty good, but then again, that's not the reason I bought it because I don't take many pics. I bought it for the front facing speakers since I do watch a lot of movies and videos.I have read negative reviews regarding support, but that's not the case with me. I did sent my phone in for repair and had it back all within 1 week. To me, support was excellent and fast.I definitely recommend this phone if you're on a budget and are looking for a great phone with an excellent media experience."
"Alcatel",4,"Just make sure to get a case and tempered glass screen protector, because many reviews state the glass is low quality, and the phone is slippery.Here are some things I'd like to see in an Idol 4.Better camera qualityBetter build quality (Includes screen)Less lagAndroid MarshmallowIf those issues were improved/fixed, this phone would surely be one of the best on the market."
"Alcatel",3,"No doubt about it, this phone is everything the reviews say. A beautiful screen! Great sound! Great battery! I haven't noticed a lag at all (I clear my tasks regularly) this phone will offer a flagship experience-EDIT-After using the phone for a few months it's not the ultra flagship I accuses it of being initially. Still not bad but for the money there are better now. The CPU uses little.Big, allowing it to swap between a strong and weak quadcore solution to match the need...the issue...the weaker CPU cluster is seriously WEAK. Daily tasks and normal use suffers severely. Multitasking isn't superb with even 2 or 3 items open, and the biggest issue..The phone keeps going BERZERK! I have never dropped it, damaged. I've never broken even a screen on a smartphone in my life, so that's not it. This phone screen starts flickering, rapid image distortions, like I dropped it in a pool. Blue screens and fast flickers."
"Alcatel",2,"Gets really hot when charging it. After a few android updates runs extremely slow. Very glitchy. The only thing good about this phone is the speakers. I would pass on this phone. Has a hard time multi tasking. Should have got the zenfone 2."
"Alcatel",5,"It's a great phone! Makes a great gift!"
"Alcatel",5,"Awesome phone! I am ecExtremely pleased with my purchase if it and so glad I did some research and feel like I bought the best possible phone for the money spent. Very sturdy, actually comes with an instruction book and great headphones. So much better than ibuds! This is my first android phone and so not have any regrets! Highly recommend! I"
"Alcatel",4,"Phone is pretty good. Gets periodic updates and hopefully will be getting Marshmallow sometime in the near future, though I'm not sure when that will be. Good battery life, quick to charge. Nice screen, but I did also get a tempered glass protector.My only complaint is that it is a bit laggy. Sometimes when you click to launch an app or double tap to wake, it take the phone a second before anything starts to happen. It's kind of a pain when you think you touched something and are waiting for the app to open, only to find you have not actually touched it are are just staring at your phone like a goon. Still, for the pricepoint, it's a great phone."
"Alcatel",5,"amazing phone"
"Alcatel",3,"Liked the phone. Screen and speakers were phenomenal. The performance for me was unacceptable the browser always bogged down and would freeze mid scroll, and the Bluetooth was horrendous. It would connect to my car then disconnect, so I've returned."
"Alcatel",4,"this is my second idol 3/ I had the first for 4 months before I dropped it on concrete and cracked the glass (with armor glass installed). It is not intended to replace parts and the cost of replacement is more than would be worth it. I like the phone enough as an inexpensive smart phone that I ordered and received the replacement from amazon within 3 days (I paid for fast delivery). Quickly got up and running. A major feature is that the phone will accept up to 128GIGs of a mini memory card. I use this large memory to hold music, audible books, pictures and large spreadsheets. Unfortunately many apps (for example x-plore, do not recognize the added memory). My favorite picture viewer QuickPic does so without any problem.."
"Alcatel",5,"I have the Alcatel Pop Icon that I bought on HSN a few months ago and like it alot, so when I read that Alcatel was coming out with their new flagship Idol 3 I couldn't wait to try it. I bought it on Amazon through Alcatel, it was very slow in coming, I wish I had waited until it was available on Amazon with Prime. The phone itself it terrific. Perfect size, beautiful screen, lightning fast, feels good in the hand, very light, couldn't ask for more! The price is great! Alcatel offers a wonderful product for a fantastic price. Just about everyone who has seen my new phone has ordered it for themselves. Very impressive. Would highly recommend."
"Alcatel",5,"Shipping was a problem for me, it came 3 days later than it said it would. Other than that, I would definitively recommend this phone. It's essentially a cheaper version of the Galaxy series (I own one, so I can compare). Yes, you lose some of the features-- the camera isnt as good, etc-- but for less than half the price as the Galaxy S6 or iPhone 6, the value is beyond comparison.The dual speakers are amazing and super loud, even at only half volume. Very clear. Awesome reversible UI so that you can have the phone in any orientation and use it, even for calls (look up a video for this). Runs Android Lollipop, so it's basically top tier. Battery life lasts me all day with very very heavy gaming use, and a few days with light to moderate use. No issues with the phone so far, or negatives other than the lack of a silencing option (also look up this bug on Android Lollipop for any phone you're looking at)"
"Alcatel",4,"Great built quality, nice looking phone, very thin and light weight, amazing audio quality, great camera, great screen. The only problem I had the first week of using it was that the WiFi was not working I tried everything to solve it and the only option I had was to factory reset it in order to make it work again which I wasn't very happy to do that. But over all its a great ""mid / high end device"" and you can't go wrong with this phone"
"Alcatel",3,"This is a ok phone. I got this phone in early offer for 200 dollar promotion. The phone comes with bells and whistles including headphones.After three week of use half of the touch screen stop responding. The full battery last for about 8 hours in regular use with occasional 1-2 mins video. I have noticed some problem while making call like other party don't hear you when you are talking. (occasional)."
"Alcatel",5,"Love it. Everything I'm looking for. Better than most flagship phones"
"Alcatel",5,"I like my phone for reasons that have already been stated more eloquently by others, so my review is going going to focus more on turning some of the dislikes I have read into likes:1.) Double Tap to Wake is not on by default. You need to enable it in the settings.2.) Double Tap to Wake is not 100% compatible with 3rd party launchers. It loses about 50% of its functionality on a 3rd party launcher IIRC. Personally, I was coming from the Google Now Launcher. (ProTip: I missed having the Google Now cards show when I swiped to the left of the home screen. One old work-around that I forgot existed is that I can just swipe up from the Home screen button (The 'O' button). Quick way to launch Google Now Launcher without making it the standard launcher or going to the app tray.) With that said, even on the Alcatel OneTouch Launcher, Double Tap to Wake is not 100% efficient. It is especially finicky when you try to use the feature to wake a phone that has entered deep sleep mode. However, if pushing the power button with your finger is a deal breaker, then that is some serious #FirstWorldProblems. I have no issues doing that one handed and my hands have never been big enough to palm a basketball.3.) Delete the (small amount of) bloatware to eliminate any unnecessary apps running in the background. This can assist in speeding up your phone if you are having issues. For example, I read that the AVG Anti-virus app specifically can cause a lot of lag on the phone since it is running in the background 24/7. Never had a need for Anti-virus scanner on Android yet so it was the first thing I trashed.4.) Personally I have been pleasantly surprised by the camera. Granted my previous phone had a mediocre camera, but still. One thing I've started doing that I've never done before is to tap the screen to focus the camera prior to taking pictures. This has been an Android feature for a while, but I just started using it and I really like how my photos are coming out, even at night. Alternatively, over at the Idol 3 XDA Forums, there are suggestions on other Camera apps to download, as well as manual settings to get the most out of your pictures if you are unhappy with the default options.5.) Try a factory reset if you are experiencing any issues after an OTA update. I think this is more to do with Lollipop than Alcatel because my other Android devices also were a little buggy after OTA updates to Lollipop until I completed a factory reset.If those suggestions do not address your concerns, Alcatel has confirmed via an email response to some XDA members that they are working on releasing another OTA update after reviewing feedback from the community.At the end of the day, many professional tech sites have stated that this is the budget phone of 2015 with good reason. Even if you think that professional reviewers are biased, here on Amazon, the current numbers as of 6/6/15 show 80% of Idol 3 reviewers gave the phone 4 stars or better. At the time of writing, the Amazon reviews of the OPO is 80% as well while the ZenFone 2 has 78% of reviews garnering 4 stars or better."
"Alcatel",1,"So I am usually not rushing to write reviews, however, it doesn't take very much time to conclude that it is a somewhat mediocre device and falls terribly and disappointingly short of satisfaction. Consider this rating a scale from 1-3 stars and I'll explain why. Depending on what you are looking for in a cell phone, the rating will go up or down. At least this is what I have seen in other reviews. I'll cut to the chase:PRO1. SPEAKERS/JBL Sound system is AMAZING. To the point that music played on this thing out plays my lap top speakers! Believe it or not. You are carrying a mini boombox. Alcatel gets 5 star is this area. They can be too loud nonetheless so please be careful and considerate or you are going to sound like that person in a relatively nice SUV with a so so speaker system that rattles.5. Look is okay. My friend thought it was an I phone or something more expensive/high end. The phone is super light.2. Screen resolution is okay. Not 4k but c'mon it's HD. I am sorry to hear reviews from people that have received defect units.CON:3. THE DOUBLE TAP FUNCTION IS ALMOST NON-EXISTENT. I DON'T KNOW IF THIS IS AN ALCATEL OR SOFTWARE PROBLEM. Most likely something to do with the device. All of these 4 and 5 stars received excellent/polished devices with no problems, which I find really hard to believe. This is annoying. You will just have to use the power button to turn on and off.6. SIM CARD DID NOT READ APPLICATIONS I HAD BEFORE AND OVERALL PHONE INTERFACE CAN TAKE TIME TO TAKE USE TO.6.5 I don't think Screen is scratch resistant.7. PHONE CAN BE SLUGGISH WHICH IS ANNOYING!!!. I WAS NOT EXPECTING THIS FROM A $250 DOLLAR PHONE. I HAVE AN OLD LG F6 Metro PCS phone and with all honesty, I don't know which is slower or faster at times. Some applications stopped working all together and I had to uninstall and install again. WTF<---!!! Really.*Caveat. My employer subsidized 50% of the cost which meant I only paid $125 out of pocket for this cell phone. BUT I am trying my best to be objective here and I can also say that I would not have paid $250 for this phone.which brings me to item number 8.8. coverage with AT&T drops randomly!!!!!!!. I DON""T CARE HOW MANY #1 or #2 STAR REVIEWS THIS PHONE HAS ON AMAZON. THIS along with the laggyness of the phone dropped this review from a solid 3 to a 2 star. A ONE STAR DOESN'T MAKE A DIFFERENCE IN MY BOOK OF REVIEWING. I was hesitant in rating this a 2 or 3 star but this made it clear. I am not crying about having 4gLTE 10000% percent of the time but when you can't hear someone because your bars just drop when other phones don't drop signal *in a good area with good reception (this statement compares other cell phones in the house) Just doesn't make sense.*second caveat. I don't pay for monthly service or service at all. BUT STILL, I WOULD NOT WANT TO PAY FOR SERVICE JUST TO HAVE A GOOD LOOKING TOY PHONE WITH GOOD SPEAKERS. NOPE. SORRY.This would be a better choice if the presale price of $200 stayed or if it was less because this is what this phone is worth. IN MY OPINION!!!9. CHIPSET and ram are a bit below mid range in terms of specs. Nothing great to be honest especially when we are entering the age of 3 and 4 Ram cell phones with Snapdragon chipsets in the 800 range and Melta kits etc.10. Battery life, at least in my case has not been impressive. I don't know if it's my device or what. But I have been using this phone not to slightly and not to heavy and it appears that the battery drains rather quickly compared to most of the reviews here and online that are boasting about this phones battery life.11.5 Phone gets warm to the point of hot near the camera when in use. Not even using for hours. Just using. This is alarming. Not sure if this is normal but again not cool.12. I don't know yet if I want to hassle and buy another phone and send this back, get my money, etc. Even though Amazon seems to do well with returns.13. I wonder if anyone else has this similar dilemma? Did anyone return it, get their money back and bought another Alcatel or something else?14. I hope my review helped someone out there. Go ahead and buy it, but please read some of the other reviews. Seems like some of us got a bad batch? Maybe. Go try your luck. this could have easily been a 3 or solid 4 star. I don't know about a 5 star. I am being honest but I am also picky. I did a lot of homework before getting here and even then I had some doubts. Guess you never know till you have one in your hands. GOOD LUCK YA'LL!"
"Alcatel",5,"I love this phone. I previously had a Galaxy Nexus on T-Mobile that was getting very long in tooth. If you have a phone on T-Mobile that doesn't have LTE, like Nexus 4, just get this phone already. Lots of areas down I-95 in North and South Carolina that don't have HSPA signals, only Edge or LTE. It was annoying my wife. She would be fuming about her slow connection on her Nexus 4, and I'm running a solid LTE signal.The only thing this doesn't have that the Nexus lines have is the wireless charging. This one has NFC for mobile payments or easily connecting Bluetooth devices, plus the addition of the microSD card slot, radio, good stereo speakers (although not the loudest), and a truly all day battery. This is a great value as well for $249.It's a big phone. I have large hands and find it hard to use one-handed. In return you get a huge screen that works well in bright Florida sun. It is surprisingly light though.One thing, without a case, I have large hands but my fingers would frequently touch the screen and cause the phone to do things unintentionally. I got one of the LK Ultra Jelly Series TPU Gel Rubber in clear frosted plastic, and it takes care of that problem. I would have gotten the manufacturers case, but it had sold out."
"Alcatel",5,"So far I really like it considering the price. I switched from a Galaxy S4. My main love is the pure android feel of the device. SO much better than Samsung's touchwiz. Night and day improvement. Size is large, yet it doesn't seems abnormally large in my pocket. Slim and sleek. Good screen quality. Headphones are nice and a bonus. Mine work fine. Some said theirs don't work? Speakers in phone are great. Battery good. Reception and call quality seem good so far for me. I do seem to have one less bar than my s4 but haven't had connection issues.Cons: Doesn't appear to have a remote controller to control the TV. I liked that about the S4. I'll have to just get over that, but became used to that feature. Camera is ok. Seems about on par with the S4 which wasn't iphone quality but pretty decent unless indoors. Faster focus though. No home button. Instead just double tap the screen. Kind of like that, but it's taking some getting used to. Frequently the double tap lags or doesn't register to wake up device. Kind of annoying. Volume on the right also taking some getting used to. As with all unlocked devices, other than iPhone you can't get WiFi calling and texting on T-Mobile. Hope android fixes that soon.Overall I'd say I'm pleasantly surprised. It's much more enjoyable to use than the S4. I just got it last night so these are my quick observations. I can update more as I use it. The interface on this thing is amazing. More like an iPhone in pleasure and ease to use. Icons are live unlike the S4. Bye touchwiz! For $250 I can't imagine a better option.Update: I'm bumping this up to 5 stars because the more I use this the more I really like it. Was at 4 stars prior. Had some issues with my alarm clock not going off. I think I've fixed the issue now... hopefully. Called tech support today and they answered right away and helped me out. Kudos to Alcatel. Only major annoyance now is that I have to hit the power button to wake up the phone. I'm getting used to it, but not quite as convenient as a home button. The double tap only works 50% of the time so I've given up on it. Overall the interface on this phone is just a pleasure to use."
"Alcatel",1,"Phone looks good, sounds good, and is even good to hold in the hand but has a tremendous amount of lag, takes too much time for apps to install, and most importantly, the signal reception on this device is TERRIBLE!!! I am constantly without service on this device. As soon as I pop out the sim and insert it into my G2 or Note 4, boom, I have full 4G LTE (I'm on AT&T). Double tap to wake almost never works. The unorthodox button placement is a PIA to get used to.I can understand the lag issue, with this being a budge device but come on Alcatel. This is 2015, phones shouldn't have reception problems these days (there's a reason we don't see the ""can you hear me now"" commercials...)"
"Alcatel",5,"Pleasantly surprised at the quality of this phone."
"Alcatel",5,"This is a very decent phone for the price. It is well designed and feels good on hand. It is not $700 phone so don't expect a flagship phone."
"Alcatel",4,"Love the phone. Great camera, memory, screen, etc. Only complaint is that text notifications seem to be inconsistent. Completely a SW issue though, is recommend this phone to anyone."
"Alcatel",5,"I am fortunate to have only paid $100 for this phone back in September. Now the price is much higher but still well worth it.My other phone is a Motorola G3, third generation, the one that is somewhat waterproof, a unique quality of that phone. I have gone back and forth with these two phones and love both of them, but I always come back to the Alcatel. Since I am a musician I value one quality of this phone that very few phone orders give a hoot about, and that's the sound. The sound produced by the speakers of this phone is truly amazing considering that it is just a cell phone. My Moto G sounds tinny by comparison and my wife has a Moto X Pure and even hers can't begin to compare with the sound of the Alcatel. I also love the unique screen size, 4.7 inches, a nice, small size that is easy to manage and has excellent quality as well.The camera is every bit as capable as the Moto G and overall this phone is a most excellent phone, especially for the price. I would highly recommend this phone, and likely even some cheaper Alcatel phones based on the quality of this one."
"Alcatel",5,"Minus the negative reviews I thought i'd give my opinions to crack down on the phone if you want a basic 16gb phone this is not really that bad it loads youtube really well and the camera feels like it tracks your height. Minus a white UI or User Interface for noobs all you have to do is install a launcher I'd prefer the Samsung S6 style because it turns the UI 100% transparent for my first phone I am satisfied. There's only one flaw is the guide book strictly tells you not to use it so much to retain its full performance speed and the battery might over heat any way so it's recommended to NOT constantly keep it on.Don't be confused because I told you the battery heats because any battery in a phone can over heat and catch fire, Sadly phones are not build with micro cooling fans which can cool down the device unless you get a phone case that supports a built in cooling fan. I would recommend a grip case though because the phone is slick. Also watch out because the phone screen its self is actually glass which is possibly fragile but has a good quality display that I really like and YES it is HD!If you get this phone make sure you also get a screen protector and I'd recommend a stylist if you're worried about smudge marks it also prevents others from seeing your pin code or drag lock code. The phone also fits with the Homido VR Head Display and can support virtual reality because it has a gyroscope and 360 tracking. I really love watching anime with it and can't wait to get it activated the only issue I had was it did not load youtube repeater that well so any way to end this I will say it's pretty good for a standard phone but if you want more performance go with a 32gb phone or above but for 16gb this phone is worth it and for the price."
"Alcatel",5,"Arrived fast. Great for that price."
"Alcatel",3,"It's nice that this phone has LTE and it functions okay. I installed a different launcher because the one that came stock was not that great. My bottom volume button stopped functioning after a few weeks, which was a bummer, but with the reversible function, I can just rotate it and get my bottom volume button to work."
"Alcatel",5,"I was astonished that a phone as inexpensive as this would work so well for me! I have virtually used more expensive Samsung phones since I have had a cell phone. Because I had a Note 7, I was waiting for another good phone to come along. I bought this for a backup/second phone figuring that I would use it for a short while. It doesn't have all the bells and whistles, or stylus, but it is a reasonable phone to have if you are on a budget. I'm no techie, but I like it as a good, inexpensive, usable phone!"
"Alcatel",2,"It scratches easy, the screen protector they sent doesn't work properly... it fell today now the digitizer is gone....it over heats with the battery....worst luck ever with phones"
"Alcatel",5,"My siblings, coworkers, and even my friends wants to buy this phone from me as soon as I unbox it and setting up the phone. I love how big it is, the system runs smooth and its everything it says on the description. I love the phone and fits my style for a great price. :)"
"Alcatel",4,"Great build quality. Almost stock Android. Little laggy performance. Good battery life."
"Alcatel",5,"There are an awful lot of Androids out there, plus other phones built on differing operating platforms . . . but this one is a standout.With the use of a SIM card you need not be tied to an expensiv 'minutes you'll never use' monthly plan. I spend $25 every 3 months on a AT+T GoPhone account - SIM only - but don't burn data on it . . . I use wifi signals whether I am at home or traveling. In 3 years I have saved $1,800!I've had the phone less than a week, and these are my observations thus far . . .THE GOOD+ Dual-band (2.4GHz / 5GHz) for wifi . . . Netflix is SNAPPY on the 5ghz band of my home router. Downloading huge maps for offline use is also ZIPPY. Disable your data function!+ Adjustable screen brightness+ The cost. I would have liked to have paid less, who wouldn't!, but this phone is a long term investment, and money well spent. If you're on one of the 'big boys' data plans, then the Idol is couch change to you.+ The camera: 13 mp front, and 8 mp rear. Nice quality, and being a photographer I know what I'm talking about. Low light? I saw one review stating that the camera function was poor in low light. Pffft!+ Video: 1080p high def. Gorgeous.+ Accessories: The screen protector, holster and the gel-like skin were all $10 each or less from Amazon.+ Display: 5.5"" is plenty big enough for reading, playing or watching movies.+ Audio: Seriously, the JBL speakers couldn't be better.+ Storage: 16gb, plus if you need it you can add a MicroSD card up to 128gb in size.+ As it's an unlocked GSM phone with a SIM, it can be used globally by purchasing a local SIM when you arrive. I've been doing that for years with my old Android.THE BAD [not really]- Power switch is on the side not the top, so I often adjust the side-mounted volume controls by accident- You can't switch to a fresh battery if need be, but that said I never used the back-up battery with my previous phone.Talking of my previous phone, it was a Chinese Android knock-off - the Star V1277 - so in comparison you're probably thinking that I'm easy to please.You're right, but so will you be if you purchase this phone!"
"Alcatel",4,"I bought this phone after having used an iPhone 5 for 2.5 years. I'm no phone expert but I have owned several smart phones including the original Samsung Galaxy, and iPhone 3, and the aforementioned iPhone5. The reason I chose this phone was the specs and the decent price. I paid 250 with a 10% discount from Amazon which reduced it to 225. For an unlocked phone that performs decently that is a good deal. My thoughts about the phone below.The good stuff: The phone itself feels solid. I like the front facing speakers - they provide good sound. The screen is good. It's bright and big and does what it's supposed to do. The back of the phone doesn't feel like plastic, although it probably is. The fact that I still can't tell three weeks into it should tell you all you need to know about that. The size of the phone was a bit daunting when I started using it (iPhone 5 is tiny compared to this phone) but it's grown on me. I can finally read comfortably using a phone. That means I use my tablet less. Finding apps is not a problem. Google apps seem to work just a little bit better on Android, although that shouldn't be a surprise. My wi-fi connectivity works great, and the phone calls I make sound clearer than my old iPhone. The 4G/LTE connectivity seems to work better too although I can't prove it.The bad: The phone is noticeably slow when starting apps. The wait time to start apps is measured in seconds and it's annoying. If you buy this phone, buy the one with 4GB RAM. One nice feature that really helps me is being able to shut down all open applications with one button click something the iPhone never had. Another bad thing are the button locations. The power button and the volume buttons are on opposite sides of the phone at the same level so when I push the button to shut off the screen I end up squeezing both sides of the phone which takes a screen shot. I can't even tell you how many screen shots I've mistakenly taken. Not a huge deal, but again, annoying. I don't particularly like where Android puts all it's system settings, but that's a personal nit since I'm still acclimating to the Android.Bottom line: It's a good unlocked phone at an affordable price. I'd recommend it with the caveats I mentioned."
"Alcatel",4,"Very much content with the phone. Works really good."
"Alcatel",3,"Screen died on me 1 week after purchasing. The screen suddenly started to display stripes and the colors are completely off. Phone was generally good but I did experience the gentle lag that all the reviews refer to. Not a deal-breaker, but noticeable. The issue with the screen did however prompt me to return the phone because I don't have a lot of confidence this phone will hold up based on the sudden change of the screen quality. I've been trying the mid-range, well rated phones of late and had no luck with this one as well as the Asus Zenfone2, so I guess I'll have to continuing searching or suck it up and just get an unlocked iPhone if I want something a little more relaible. I want to love this phone, it's almost there, the headphones are really good, the screen was great before it crapped out, but I just don't want to putz around troubleshooting something I just bought. Better luck next time I hope..."
"Alcatel",5,"I am a tech junkie, and this is one of the best cell phones I've ever used. The screen is beautiful, the look and feel is very premium, the speakers are the best I've heard on any mobile device, and the software is the perfect blend of stock Android and some very useful customizations (the feature that flips the screen orientation is really cool). Seriously, the speaker is outstanding - music sounds incredible and I now love to use the speakerphone. The ONLY complaints I have about it are that it is sometimes a TAD bit slower than the flagship phones in opening a program or doing a task, and the camera sometimes has grainy images in low light or when you zoom in. But even then, I compared it with other phones, and I'd say the pictures are only 5%-10% more noisy than the best ones, so it's not a big deal. Plus the shutter speed is really fast. And I like that the LED flash is a more yellow color which leads to more natural toned pictures taken with the flash.The button placement, as people have mentioned, is a little weird, but it is not a big deal and you get used to it quickly."
"Alcatel",5,"Very good device I've had it for a few days so far so good. I love the speakers and the screen and front facing Speaker's are awesome for media comsuption and getting LTE on ATT by way of straight talk. All in all if your looking for a phone that's tech heavy that you can root and play graphic heavy games without lag get he asus 4gb or the one plus , but if you just like me just wanted a good around phone that has a beautiful screen and great speakers and get LTE and a good battery life get this"
"Alcatel",5,"Wow-wee I love this Alcatel OneTouch Idol 3 phone! I've had it for week now and it does everything I want.The phone, Billy, showed up within 24 hours of being ordered - one of the perks of Amazon Prime. It arrived in great condition.I use Billy on a T-Mobile pay-as-you go plan and the T-Mobile store was able to transfer my contacts over from my old Blackberry phone. They were also able to cut down my large size SIM card to fit the Alcatel OneTouch Idol 3 small SIM card format. They also fit in my old 8GB memory card without trouble. They said the passcode had to be turned off to transfer the contacts and this phone does not allow the passcode to be turned off, but they were able to transfer everything over OK.To make full use of the features of this phone I had to create a free Google account, which was no big deal. It is not required to use the phone, but it makes it easier to use the built in Google apps.The text messaging interface works nicely and seems to be adapting to my style and word choice. It suggests the next word and is getting better and better and predicting what I am trying to say which makes texting faster.The camera takes amazing pictures with crystal clarity. I'm really impressed with the quality of pictures it takes. Speaking of clarity, I've watched a couple of YouTube videos on it and I was blown away. The resolution and crispness of the colors is better than my television and the sound it fantastic.I also got a FitBit and I really enjoy monitoring my progress on this phone.The battery lasts me throughout the day although the battery is low by the end on the day. My old Blackberry would last for 3 days before it needed a charge, although I would charge it every night. But to be fair, with all the increased features on this phone, I'm using Billy a lot more. It is also much bigger than my old phone. I used to wear my old phone on a holster on my belt, but that doesn't seem practical with a phone of this size. It generally fits in my deeper trouser pockets OK.Overall a great phone and I really love it."
"Alcatel",4,"Had issues on the start up. Randomly restarted. Once up and running a little sluggish, but you get what you pay for."
"Alcatel",5,"Writing this review on the idol 3 and the phone is great so far. Battery has been solid, apps work silky smooth, and reception is great on it. Seems to be very well built and it is an absolute steal for the price. Don't know how durable it is, but with a case it should hold up just fine. Would definitely recommend for anyone looking for an amazing budget friendly smartphone."
"Alcatel",5,"Excellent"
"Alcatel",3,"This is an awesome device for the price. Feels good in hand. Great display even in sunlight. Loud audio. Really cool software features. Pretty fast. Noticed a little stutter when downloading a web page with multiple embedded mixed media. Did not try any games on it. Double tap sleep was great. Double tap wake worked <50% of the time. Minimal bloatware. A pleasure to use!The problem: Using this on T-mobile, I could not get a good enough signal in my house to make or receive calls and texts. Figured that it wasn't a carrier issue since my kids (in same house with same carrier) had no issues with cell reception on their Moto X (2013) and Samsung Galaxy S5. It wasn't a SIM card issue, I put it in my 9.7 inch Chinese phone tablet that wasn't meant to be used in the U.S. and I was able to get a strong, consistent 3G signal and make calls from it with good clarity. My phone seemed locked to finding an LTE signal, and instead of dropping to 3G or 2G connections, it would simply not connect at all. Through 95% of the house I would get No signal or Emergency calls only mode. If I changed settings to 3G only or 2G only I could sometimes get a good signal for a while, but then it would suddenly disappear even when the phone isn't moved (sitting on the table). I lost signal completely at a local Subway, at my doctor's office, and had a call cutoff a couple times while sitting at a mall parking lot. I need my kids to be able to reach me at all times in case of emergency.Signal strength on this phone throughout my house would be about -125dBm and 99 asu while on LTE or no signal at all. I got a Samsung Galaxy S4 on sale for $299 and was able to connect consistently throughout the house. It's LTE signal strength was about -115 dBm and 35 asu, so the Idol 3 was about -10 dBm worse and hence no calls. Right now the S4 switched down to HSPA with -105 dBm and 4 asu. The Idol 3 would never switch down, just lose connection. Not sure if that is a problem with my specific phone or a general software issue. The Galaxy S4 can also make wifi calls, so I kept the S4 and returned the Idol 3.I had great connectivity on the Idol 3 at work and in an adjacent city, so if you live in an area with good coverage and won't venture out of the area much, then this phone may work great for you.While sorting through this issue, Alcatel was very responsive to my emails, so +1 to the seller. I hope their next phone has a better antenna and is wifi-enabled for calls, because I really liked this device. I really wanted it to work for me, but bottom line, the best phone for me is one that can keep a connection with my carrier in my area so that I can make and receive calls and texts. A phone that can't make calls is useless to me.For those of you who have great reception, you've got a good device at a great price!"
"Alcatel",3,"So much for the joys of unlocked phones. Regardless whether I let Android automatically detect network or I manually choose any of the 3 discovered MetroPcs networks, I receive error the ""SIM Card Not Permitted to Connect"" to network. Went to YouTube and created a few custom APNs to no avail. Alcatel .pdf says all you need to do is plop in the SIM, your micro flash and let Android do the rest. 250 dollar brick at the moment. Returned the SIM back to the old phone and all is well. Not the experience I expected, having read the Alcatel guide online.**Update: Replacement phone has no Chinese-language error messages. That was first hint that initial phone had some unusual problem. Amazon returns are very easy and as soon as box was in UPS queue the refund was issued (same day). Metro would not associate phone ID with network without purchase of a new $26 dollar SIM card from the store. I would think an active SIM from previous device associated with new device should work, but I would be mistaken. That's how they roll, apparently. Their rationale is that stolen phones on their network are their bane and this procedure makes their lives easier by associating one phone per card--whatever. How nice for them. Folks at company-owned store were polite and efficient about it, though. Phone, itself, is pretty good. If the ""Recent Apps"" screen had no esoteric animation, there would be no performance lags to report. Launching and switching between apps is quick. Great media device. Handles everything I throw at it with ease. While the Sony hardware is so-so, it looks like the preloaded software isn't the best, either. Swap out the installed Camera app with after-market one and the reported camera deficiencies are improved, even in lower light. For $250 bucks it's hard to beat for average use. Cell phone connoisseurs will never like this phone so ignore the hate."
"Alcatel",4,"A really great phone. Only the headphones don't work on the phone. Works on other phones. But not on this phone. My Bose works on this my Sony works on this phone but not the one included. Yet the included headphone works on my iPhone 6. ????? Go figure.Over all a great phone hit the price."
"Alcatel",5,"Nice phone, sounds amazing I recomend it"
"Alcatel",4,"Excellent battery life that lasts a day of hard usage, survived a 4 foot drop onto a wood floor, very good audio, and a mostly lag free experience.The only flaw would be the lack of Wi Fi calling with T mobile"
"Alcatel",5,"Summary:Just an amazing phone for any price range.I have been using my Idol 3 for about 4 days now and I must say I am loving everything about it. People all over the net keep talking about just how great the screen and speakers are. I can't stress this enough they are both truly amazing. I am coming from the OnePlus One and although on paper the OPO has slightly better specs all around. I think that Alcatel did a much better job of implementing android more so then CM did. I stress this because basic functionality just operates so much smoother. For example typing. Typing just about anywhere whether it be writing an email or texting or whatever, is just extremely responsive. After having used my OPO for almost a year I had gotten used to having to type a little slow. On the IDOL 3 I can speed type again which means I can get more work emails done faster this I love! I don't see to many people talk about this fact but the screen is very responsive as well as it is bright. This is also my first phone with front facing speakers. All I can say is wow what a difference that makes. I watch a lot of videos on my phone and it does really enhance the experience all around. The phone itself is actually smaller than the OPO as well as it is thinner. It feels very sturdy and portable I put a screen protector and case on my and it is still very pocketable. Also a lot of people are asking about updates. Well I too am a little concerned about updates. However right out of the box I received one OTA update of around 50mb which I installed right away. Every now and then you see a little lag if you are a heavy multi tasker like I am. But I feel confident that this is related to crappy lollipop 5.0.2 and that once this guy gets the latest 5.1.1 those issues should be all smoothed out as 5.1.1 is know to perform quite a bit better and isnt supposed to have the memory leaks found in 5.0.1. My only other is the double tap to wake. This feature works here and there and isnt very reliable. I am sure they could fix this in a software update."
"Alcatel",2,"I purchased this phone for my uncle.IIRC, this phone only has 4~5 Language selections.English (US), English (UK), French, Spanish, and I don't remember the rest.The thing is android OS has many languages available on its root,yet Alcatel purposely disabled the rest of the languages and made them unavailable.It was for my uncle who doesn't read English well, and I was surprised that Alcatel tweaked the OS to make a lot of languages unavailable."
"Alcatel",4,"It's a great phone and an awesome value. Was stepping up from a Nexus 4. It's pretty close to stock Android with some minor tweaks to the UI - which I didn't mind. Battery life was pretty good (I could go a couple days with medium usage). The screen is crisp and bright. Sounds were loud and clear. And that brings me to a minor issue I had with the ringer and notification volumes: At the lowest level they were a bit too loud. Call quality and data speeds were great. I did experience occasional sluggishness when opening and switching between apps. As I used it for a couple of days, I struggled to get used to the power button on the left and the volume rocker on the right (it's completely opposite of the Nexus 4). This, combined with the larger size made it awkward to turn on/off and adjust volumes. I thought I would enjoy a larger device with the 5.5"" screen, but I just couldn't get used to it. Perhaps, if I kept using it, I would eventually get used to it. But why compromise? I'd rather buy a device and love it from the get go. Welcome back Nexus 4! For me, I think the 4.7"" screen is the perfect size. I still recommend this phone."
"Alcatel",5,"I am on a iPhone 5s currently, which I use for my daily use and workouts, coz of the small size. But because of that I am not able to read properly. So, instead of getting a tablet I opted for the idol 3, given the price and good screen size.I am happy with it. I use it for reading and the size is just right.+great screen and brightness+decent battery+speakers are excellent+included JBL earphones are very good+premium finish+very thin bezel all around.-Slippery in my hands, needs a case for sure-there's an ever so slight delay, not bothersome, but it's a tad slow if you are coming from a snapdragon 801/805 processor."
"Alcatel",5,"Great Phone"
"Alcatel",4,"I have gone through a Samsung Galaxy S5 , an IPhone 6 plus , an Lg G2 and now landed on this ALCATEL ONE TOUCH IDOL 3 phone all within the last 8 months , having used high end devices , I did not have too high of expectations from the Idol 3 as it only cost $199 at the pre order special price . I have been playing with it for the last two days and below are my impressions .Pros : the biggest one is how much device you are getting for your money , this phone has a large 5.5 inch 1080p display , JBL tuned front firing stereo speakers that sound great , a 3000maH battery , heck it even comes with rather nice JBL earbuds in a nice package , these are specs you will find on devices that cost much more from other well known brands . the build quality is just fine , the phone feels nice in the hands , the software is well done with Android Lollipop running almost stock with very little customization done from Alcatel and not much bloatware. the display has rather accurate colors and looks sharp just like any other flagship device , the 13 Mp main camera is not the best in the business but pictures look sharp in well lit places and okay for low light ones . the front facing camera is just okay as well . you can perform almost all tasks on this phone without any slowness for the most part (see cons ) and this is where I should get in to the cons .Cons: so what is the catch , I mean there has to be one for a device that costs less then half the amount of a flagship device from other Major brands , well for one thing the Octa Core Qualcom 615 processor used in this phone might sound mighty on paper but the fact is that it is an outdated processor by today's standards , although it performs most tasks just fine , you will find stutter and slowness while browsing the web in the browser and in some apps , it is also not the best device for gaming . the battery specs also look great on paper but so far I have been rather underwhelmed by it with Lg G2 outlasting this phones battery by hours , I hope that the battery will get better with a few more charge cycles . overall all though it is a fantastic device for very little money , if you watch youtube , movies or listen to lots of music on your phone then you will love the front facing speakers , just do not expect this device to be as fast as the $700 phones out today and you will be just fine ."
"Alcatel",4,"Love the phone for the price. Changing the standard icons seems a little silly and it definitely runs hot, but I am happy with it overall.Update: My son thought my phone needed water so RIP Idol 3. Had bring your own device family plan insurance through AT&T(needed it on phone purchased via Next). The claim with Asurion was a HOT mess. This phone was not on their ""list"" of devices and they really don't have any infrastructure for a non flagship phone. Their replacement of like quality was an LG G Flex 2. They charged a tier 3($200) deductible and had no way to appeal that decision. Seriously, 71% deductible. AT&T and Asurion played hot potato about the $200 deductible and I ended up filing Dept of Insurance and FTC complaints.So, long story short either assume the risk and don't get insurance on this phone or insure it via anyone but Asurion. SquareTrade has a $75 flat deductible, repair instead of replace options, and costs less than AT&T/Asurion too"
"Alcatel",4,"I really like this phone. The screen is beautiful! The rear camera is excellent! The whole thing is very zippy.The downside is that average real use is only about 14-18 hours on a full charge. You MUST plug it in every night or it will be dead in the morning. If you had a particularly full day of cellular data use, I think the above numbers would be halved down to 7-9 hours."
"Alcatel",5,"I showed it to my friends whom have never heard about it, they could not believe the Alcatel can put in a such flagship qualities on very affordable price. Phone runs pretty fast and smooth on every apps that i throw at.it. T-mobile LTE and SMS work nicely our of the box. JBL speakers are very clear and crisp.I'm debating with myself about whether to keep it or go for a better deal on the Asus Zenfone 2 (64 GB and 4 GB memory version)Any references?"
"Alcatel",4,"This is the best bang for your buck phone.$250 no tax ( I ordered when it was 1 day promo at $199)This phone is the best phone for the person who uses the phone for phone calls, email, social media, browsing and messaging.If you take a lot of photos from back camera, you may want to tapper your expectations. Front camera is OKThis phone's sound quality for media (music apps/ YouTube etc) is the best one I have used and it beats my note 4. It uses jbl stereo speakers which produces amazing sound. You will not need your Bluetooth speaks for park or BBQ.Gaming is not that good and there is a little lag for heavy duty apps.This phone is better than lg g3, nexus 5, galaxy s5 or HTC m8 and other last year's flagship models.If camera is not the priority, I use this over one plus one. It is better than moto g and previous moto x.It's not going to compete with s6 note 4 or nexus 6 or m9.Microsd slot is a plus for some but removable battery and lack of quick charge is a minus for many. IDC about removable battery.Given the price I paid ($200), I am a satisfied customer and would recommend anyone who plans to buy a budget smartphone. Why pay $650 if you are going to use your phone for tasks which do not require the high end specs."
"Alcatel",5,"Throughout my lifetime, the prices on consumer electronics have dropped steadily as capability and quality rises. Smartphones have been an exception, largely because of the subsidy model, and something that acts as a good quality tablet but with data connection and the ability to make phone calls could easily run you close to $800. That puts this Alcatel Onetouch clearly in the budget category, despite being more expensive than a tablet or moderate sized television.These days many carriers are moving away from the subsidy model, and those who are looking for less expensive phones were stuck with ones that were far less capable. Alcatel has changed that with this phone. While it won't compete with the latest high end models on today's market, it has power and capability that even high end phones lacked even a few years ago. This ""unlocked"" phone is technically a non-locked phone. It's not loaded with a slew of apps from a specific provider and even lets you get rid of some default apps that you may not want. An important thing for any device not tied to any specific carrier is compatibility. This phone covers all the bands needed for carriers such as AT&T or T-Mobile or any other that uses a SIM, and that includes 4G and LTE bands.It gives you 16GB of memory, with about 10GB available for user content. It also supports a microSD card, for up to 128GB more. It takes a micro SIM, which is fairly standard these days. It gives you a fast Octa-Core Qualcomm Snapdragon 615 processor, which I found responsive. I haven't tested it with video games that are extremely CPU or graphically intensive, but for typical tasks there should be no lag. You get very good sound for built in speakers, and the phone works just as well when you flip it over, even for phone calls.The cameras are very good resolution for an inexpensive phone, and are better than what even high end ones had a few years ago. But you don't get any special frills or controls for exposure. You get a good 13MP camera and an 8MP front facing camera, both of which beat what you find on other inexpensive phones, and both can rival cameras on better phones for outdoor daylight photos. For low light situations, you will get adequate pictures but not at the level of high end devices. You also get 1080p video. One of the big advantages of the video button is that it starts taking video and stops taking video. On other cameras, it will switch you to video mode, but why? All that accomplishes is letting you share the shutter button, which offers little value and is especially awkward if you want to take landscape videos. With this phone, the video button is in a logical place for landscape video, there's no reason to switch modes, and your shutter button still works for still photos. That way you can take video much faster without waiting to switch modes, and the button will work for those holdouts who still insist on vertical videos.I haven't torture tested it, but the glass is supposed to be highly scratch resistant and more breakage resistant than for typical phones. The phone itself doesn't have the look or feel of a cheap phone. Phone screens have been growing larger, and this one gives you a 5.5 inch screen. Personally I could make do with a smaller screen, but companies make phones with smaller screens that sacrifice capability in many other ways and Alcatel is no exception.A few things I don't like about the phone are that the battery isn't removable. That might not be a long term problem since battery life is pretty good. I also don't like the offset USB connector on the bottom since it makes it awkward to use the built in cradle in my car. This is a disadvantage compared to what works well for companies such as Samsung or Apple. The other thing that's apparently missing is WiFi calling for T-Mobile. Google now has a Hangouts dialer, which can accomplish the same thing and aside from caller ID not pointing to your primary number that could be a workaround.Other issues have to do with support. The phone has been out long enough now that the company should have phone-specific support information on its website, but it's still not there. This phone doesn't show up on the list on the support page. That means there are no downloads or phone specific FAQs. The phone comes with a Quick Start Guide, but no user manual and there's none on the website.UPDATE: There is still no link to a user manual on their website, but customer service was able to send me a URL for one. There are some features that need further explanation and I was hoping that the user manual would cover them. For example, the status LED doesn't work like the one on other phones or have colors to indicate anything. The phone has a setting to turn it on or off. You'd expect the manual to tell you what the LED indicates, but all the manual says about that setting is ""Touch to turn on/off the LED indicator."" If you want to know how the time lapse feature for the camera works, the manual says ""Touch to enable Time-lapse"" when describing the setting, but that's already obvious.Overall, you get a lot for your money. It may not be the highest end phone out there, but the big companies better look over their shoulders. It beats what they offer at this price point and I wouldn't be surprised if this company has something that is truly competitive with the competition's top of the line in the near future."
"Alcatel",4,"Very good product! An improvement over my 2 year old moto g no doubt. My one and only issue so far is that sometimes it doesn't respond right away opening an app"
"Alcatel",4,"Take a step back and think about this thing. It has an identical screen to, and RAM of, an Iphone 6 Plus, for a sixth the price. Pop in an SD for more storage. Similar or better form factor too, with nice stereo speakers and better earbuds than an Iphone. Performance is smooth, and it updated immediately to Marshmallow. What's not to like?I guess one thing. Reports around the web indicate the screen may crack under light pressure/drops. So get a case and screen protector. Because this is an older model phone, both can be found cheap at the usual suspects."
"Alcatel",5,"Shipping pretty fast . They left it by my garage, not on my front door or mailbox , which confused me on where it was when I received the notification saying it was on my porch . But overall , it's in perfect shape and it works amazingly . Thank you"
"Alcatel",5,"Gracias, excelente."
"Alcatel",5,"Buy from $100 worth the money! Speaker is great , and can upgrade to 6.0.Available language is not enough.No other problem yet"
"Alcatel",5,"I love this phone! By the way, if you are looking for other cases for it I be using the blue vivo xl cases. It fit but the headphone Jack is a little off. Also, the buttons on the sides is off to but you can set this phone to turn on and off by tapping the screen( Which is a plus). But that's just what I use. The phone is love!"
"Alcatel",5,"Excellent value for price,Decent phone."
"Alcatel",5,"Exelente"
"Alcatel",1,"Have only had this phone for sub two weeks and have had nothing but issues out of the box. Constant freezing and crashing, i cant even use certain apps, my photos don't load and the phone straight up goes black screen and restarts at least once a day. Very unhappy customer at this point in time."
"Alcatel",2,"Great screen, slim and light. Occasionally gets quite warm. The reason for two stars is durability, it has none. The power switch quit after 14 months on the first phone. I've owned 20 or so phones and never had a power switch quit on me. I bought a second phone for a family member and the screen auto cracked. This is likely the reason it is only $100 now versus $240 a year ago. Great phone but do not expect it to last for more than a year."
"Alcatel",4,"seems more stable than my old gen 1 Moto G but because of the location of the volume and power button I am constantly accidently doing screen captures. I am still trying to adapt to the new version of Android and how the phone it self works. I don't like the white background in the app menu, white uses a lot more juice making the battery deplete quicker. The feel has me missing my Moto G. I like the thicker body of the G but really like the Idols excellent speakers and can handle more storage than the Moto."
"Alcatel",4,"I've used a lot of high-end smart phones, including Samsung, Apple, Google Nexus, and LG. I had to buy this phone for a consulting project, and I wound up liking it so much, I returned my Google Nexus 5X, and bought another of these as my phone. It has expandable storage (micro-SD) which was important to me. It has surprisingly good (better than Nexus 5x) battery life. It does not have typical high-end phone bloatware installed.I would have given this 5 stars but the camera is just not up to par with the best of the smartphones (should it be for $250??).I would have preferred a 5.2"" screen (over its 5.5"") but that is just me. All in all, this is a great phone."
"Alcatel",5,"Great!"
"Alcatel",1,"I've had this phone for 3.5 months now and am thoroughly disappointed with it. It doesn't multitask very well. Freezes up at the most inopportune times. And has begun restarting itself randomly throughout the day! Save your money!!!!"
"Alcatel",2,"Screen cracked less then a month after I bought it. I either emailed or called Alcatel two months later because I was in a remote location without the ability to pack something and ship it. They said their was nothing they could do except charge me for a repair. Really disappointed cause I was looking forward to using it but it is unusable since the lower half of the screen is unresponsive."
"Alcatel",3,"This is my first Alcatel OneTouch phone. These are what I've experienced during my usage.I bought this phone because my brother's iPhone 4s was too slow and too small. He already used an Android device, but he feels more comfortable on iOS.Pros1. Thin and lightweight design (not my kind of thing, but most people would like it)2. Great display (almost rivals the $389 OnePlus 2, which is my daily driver)3. Loud speakers (louder than the Galaxy S6, the LG G4, and the OnePlus 2, but not as loud as the HTC One M9, the Moto X Pure Edition, and the Nexus 6P)4. Nice battery life (better than the Galaxy S6, but not as good as the Nexus 6P)5. Clean UI (uninstallable bloatware, stock Android-like interface)Cons1. Average performance (1.5GHz octa-core S615, 2GB RAM is not as good as the Asus Zenfone 2 and the OnePlus X)2. Average rear-facing camera (colors are dull, focus is slow)3. Charging speed (2 and 1/10 hours)4. Bloatware (even though it can be uninstalled, it'd be nice if it just didn't come with it)5. Not durable enough (doesn't feel robust and dependable)6. Price (it needs to be $200)So, it's an overall okay phone for the price, but I would go with the Zenfone 2 or the OnePlus X. Also, for $199.99, the Honor 5X has very similar specs to the Idol 3 5.5"". So, I wouldn't fault you if you just bought one, but you can do better."
"Alcatel",5,"The best.phone for the price.haha."
"Alcatel",2,"I bought this phone because of the reviews I seen here and because of the price for the specs this phone has. After 5 months of use I can say definitely say that this phone is a huge disappointment.The Idol 3 has a nice big 1080p display which looks great, 2 GB of RAM, a decent processor, slim sleek design, and a mostly bloat-free stock Android OS. Unfortunately, the software is horribly unoptimized because this phone suffers from lots of performance issues. Lag when watching videos on YouTube, blurry pictures with the camera, and apps taking ages to open up are some examples.I had my phone bricked when trying to take a system update so I set up a warranty repair on their website and overnighted my phone to Alcatel. Only to have it returned to me 3 days later unrepaired because my phone had ""water damage"". My phone has been in a case since day 1 and has never been submerged in or splashed with water. Clearly they don't want to honor their warranty.Pair that with the fact that this phone rarely gets patches and will likely never be updated to Android 6.0 and I recommend paying a little more for a Galaxy, LG, or Nexus phone."
"Alcatel",5,"Very nice phone. Fast and really good looking. Have gotten many compliments. Nice camera. Good phone overall!"
"Alcatel",5,"I'm an IT professional, although I'm also a single dad of 3. So price is the main thing here. This is the best phone... For the price I could get. I love it! Camera is great. Compared to me friends LG V10. I have almost all the hardware for less than half the price. The speakers are the best Ive ever heard on a phone in the mid or flagship range. No overly loud but stereo quality is excellent. The LCD display is amazing for what it is. No 4k was not a deal breaker for me 1080p is more than enough. I've dropped it at least 20 times and there is not even a scratch. EvoCel case. With TMobile the quality is off the charts compared to my old S4 and Lumia 640. If your on a budget you cant get much more for the price!"
"Alcatel",2,"I really, really wanted to like this phone. The screen is just fantastic and the speakers are amazing. It absolutely blows away my Moto X 2014 in that regard. The processor is OK, there's a bit of lag here and there but it's not overwhelming and something you can easily live with. The battery life seemed to be really fantastic, and it was a mostly great device.I only ran into problems when it comes to using it as a phone. Calls sound muddy, and everyone who I spoke to had issues understanding me. Coming from my Moto X, which had fantastic call quality, this was very disappointing. Using the phone in speakerphone mode didn't help at all, if anything, it made it worse! I've also noticed it struggled with signal strength in the same areas where the X had no issue, consistently pulling a signal that was anywhere between 5-7 dBm worse than the X.Maybe I got a bad device, but in reading more reviews I've noticed that muffled calls and signal issues seem to be commonplace. Honestly, a slightly better microphone and antenna would make this a killer phone. If your goal is to use the browser and apps, you'll be fine with this phone. If you plan on anything more than occasional call, I'd look for something else."
"Alcatel",5,"I purchased this phone a few weeks ago but wanted to wait until Alcatels update before I posted a review. Pre update this phone was 4 stars tops. Post update it's a 5. You may have noticed other reviews knock the double tap feature. That's been completely fixed. The camera is better and lag is nearly non existent.Pros1) the front speakers are as good as advertised - I've tested them with my HTC m8 and they are easily on par with boomsound (without the infamous bezel).2) battery life is insanely good3) screen quality and brightness is top notch4) I LOVE the reversible screen. It's not a gimmick and actually is useful, especially when I have a headphone jack plugged in. I can now decide if I want the headphones jack to be on the bottom or the top.5) SD expansion. Enough said.6) near stock Android. I don't feel the need to add a launcher like I did with previous Samsung phones (s4, s5)7) cool features like a compass and fm radioCons1) music tends hiccup every now and then. Doesn't matter which player I'm using or how I'm listening (headphones or directly through the speakers). Was hoping that the update would fix but it didn't. Hopefully a future update will.2) no IR. I get it, it's a $250 phone so this is nitpicking honestly3) wish the battery was removable. This used to be a deal breaker for me but it seems to be the trend nowadays. Learning to deal.The camera is neither a pro or a con for me. It's not as good as the s6, g4 or even the s5. But it is as good or better than the m8 (don't know about the m9). It isn't bad by any stretch... Especially outdoors. (Sony lens).Bottom line is I love this phone. I'm sold and simply can't justify $700 or $800 for other flagships nor can I justify subsidizing or anything like that any longer. The idol 3, zenphone and moto g seem to be setting a trend in the smartphone world and it's exciting stuff. So glad I picked this up!EDIT: 6 months in and I'm sill loving this phone for all of the reasons above. Hoping for a Marshmallow update and now looking forward to a (hopefully soon) announcement for the idol 4."
"Alcatel",5,"Love the phone. Had a iPhone 4 and galaxy s3. This Alcatel is better in every way. Battery, speakers, flip screen. Etc. If I ever need I'll be buying Alcatel again."
"Alcatel",5,"I upgraded from the galaxy s3, by taking a leap of faith and buying the Alcatel onetouch3 (and a 64 GB micro SD). My gamble paid off, this product has, so far, exceeded expectations.For the basic smartphone user, it has every feature you need, including a flash on the camera. There's no removable battery, but I'm sure it will last at least 2 years regardless. If you're like me and don't need top end features but want a good android phone at a reasonable price, I'm pretty sure you wont be disappointed going with this phone.For you hardcore phone-o-files, its basically a no frills new android os and the no frills means no bloatware, fast load/response times and a solid day on the battery usage. I'm sure it's highly customizable for those that enjoy modding the os."
"Alcatel",4,"I've been playing with the phone for only a day. The Nexus 4 is my previous phone. There are many review articles and videos online about the Idol 3. Each stating about the same thing. Good enough but not great processing power. Good but not great camera. Close to stock Android. Big, bright and clear display. Poor button placement. I just wanted to comment on the many reviews that say the buttons are too high. I think the designers took into account that this smartphone will be handled by two hands by most people. Holding it in your left hand and using your right to navigate positions the buttons perfectly. Your left thumb is on the power with the left index on the volume. So people who buy this phone knowing to use two hands and they want value for their dollar... They'll find it difficult to beat this one. I for one am very happy with the product so far."
"Alcatel",4,"If your a smart person and you are looking for a smartphone, this is the right phone for you! The Idol 3 is not a high-end smartphone like the samsung galaxy s6 or the lg g4, but it does deliver some pretty good performances and specs for the average user and you get this phone for around 1/3 the price. The camera is good but not for professional phototagraphers. The display is a full hd ips display and can be very birght. The phone is made of plastic but it has a nice brushed finish which makes it look premium. The Duel Front facing speakers are loud and clear. Now the reason I gave this product a 4 star is the performances and experiences I had recently. The double tap feature is sometimes laggy and sometimes I have to double tap multiple times to get the phone open. When I go on a heavy website on the web browser, I can barely scroll the screen. We will see an update for this phone however, and hopefully these issues will be resolved. In conclusion get this phone and stop thinking about those high end smartphones."
"Alcatel",1,"I have never been as disappointed with an item from Amazon as I am with this one.First, some good points about the phone. The display and audio are top notch. Not even by grading on the curve of a $250 phone, they were as good or better than just about any flagship I've had. As good or better than any other display I've seen, and the front facing stereo speakers were amazing. No question about it. The phone performed fairly well, just a little bit slower than my 2013 LG Optimus G Pro, which had the same basic specs as this unit. The almost stock Android Lollipop was a nice thing to have, not much bloatware had to be removed. I changed the phone's supplied launcher to the Google Launcher and that gave the unit even more of a stock Android feel.I should have known I was in for a nightmare when I opened the phone and found that Alcatel didn't include the tool that's needed to pop out the SIM and SD card tray. It took a couple of hours to find something small enough to fit into the tiny hole that releases the tray, and since the phone arrived on a Saturday, Alcatel tech support was closed and Amazon was no help, offering to send a replacement phone that might arrive Monday, but most likely would come Tuesday. Glad I pay for Amazon Prime to get such speedy service when a product is defective. But I finally got the tray open and was able to insert the SIM and SD cards from my current phone. Turned the phone on and it immediately found AT&T, provisioned itself smoothly, and I thought I was off to the races. Boy, was I wrong.I spent almost two days migrating apps from my old phone to this one, arranging the icons on the screen where I wanted them (this phone only allowed 4 icons in a row while the LG had 5, so the NFC setup process couldn't replicate my current screen arrangement) and re-entering login and other information for all my apps. I have a fair amount of apps, so it took a while. In order to clean the cache and speed up the phone a bit after everything was ""just so"", I restarted the phone, something I've done with the ten or so other Android phones I've had over the years. When the phone came back up, I noticed that about a third of the app icons were gone from my home screens. Just gone. And when I tried to open a couple of other apps, I got a message on the bottom of the screen that the app wasn't installed.I know Android can do some funky things, so I waited about ten minutes to see if the information would show up on the screen and it hadn't changed, so I rebooted the phone again. When it came on, even MORE icons were missing from the home screens. I could find most (not all) of the missing apps in the app drawer and could launch about half of them. But some of the data was gone, with very little chance of getting it back. And since I lost more data the second time I restarted the phone, I wasn't really interested in restarting again and losing even more data.So the two days I spent getting the phone loaded up were blown the second I tried to restart it. I hardly call that a small bug, and looking around some developer forums, it doesn't seem to be a bug tied to Android 5.0.2, which is what the phone is running with an Alcatel layer over it. So it's either the Alcatel modifications or a hardware issue causing the problem. Either way, that kind of performance is completely unacceptable, and while I think the phone has some good parts to it and the price is right, if it's going to lose data, I can't trust it or continue to use it. Even my kid's $99 BLU phone is more stable than this device is.So back to Amazon it goes, along with the accessories that were supposed to arrive on Sunday but didn't come because Amazon made a deal with the Devil when they chose the USPS to handle its Sunday deliveries. All in all, about a $300 lesson that sometimes you get what you pay for, and in this case I got a useless, low quality phone on the inside that looks like a great phone on the outside.Oh, and one more thing. Amazon chose to ship the phone via USPS in a padded envelope, not a box. I found the envelope with the phone in it jammed in my mailbox with all my other mail, making for a very tight squeeze to get the envelope out of the mailbox without tearing it. So the phone had less protection than it probably should have had and went through the postal system, which could have led to some kind of a hardware defect. I'm not going to try my luck with another phone, especially if Amazon is going to use such an insecure way to ship the phone. I bet they don't ship S6's in envelopes. Just sayin'.Next time, I'll spend a little more money and get a phone I can trust."
"Alcatel",5,"Outstanding value. Very good recption on H2O network (AT&T MVNO). Screen is just brilliant . . . easy to read in direct sunlight at Noon in San Antonio, Texas. Sound is sharp and clear through front facing speakers. Great battery life. Reverseability works as advertised & is very handy. Being as this is from a second tier manufacturer I did not expect stellar quality or support. I was wrong. I got an OTA software update yesterday (7/13/2025) that was an unexpected surprise. Double tap to wake is now rock solid. Android software is nearly stock and any bloatware is easily removed, unlike other manufacturers I could mention (Samsung,LG, etc.). This phone replaced a Nexus 5 and IMHO is superior in every way."
"Alcatel",5,"The Idol 3 has been provided an amazing experience for me at a third of the cost of some of the top-tier phones available on the market. At $250 this smartphone provides all of the functionality I would want from a daily driver and there are only a few nit-picky features (a better camera, ir blaster, wireless charging and dedicated shutter button) missing that I would need to have to ""upgrade"" away from this phone. The previous phones I have used in order are the Galaxy Note II, Moto X, and the Sharp Aquos Crystal and this phone blows them all out the water.Design and Size:Simply put, this phone feels great in the hand. The symmetrical design and lack of capacitive keys really make the phone seem much smaller than other phones of the same screen size. At 5.5"" this phone is relatively easy to use one-handed (and I have average to small-sized hands for a guy). It is also as light or lighter than my previous phones. It does not have ""premium build quality"" with metals or glass, but personally that has never mattered to me. Besides the customization of designing my Moto X nothing really stood out as ""me"" when looking to purchase other phones. But besides all that, the phone looks great. The brushed metal look works for me, and since it is plastic it works for my wallet as well. I have never had an issue with dropping this phone or it feeling awkward to use.Screen:This screen is great. It is 1080p, videos play well, colors pop, and I can take it out in the middle of the day and actually see the screen in direct sunlight. The size of the screen also makes reading text easier and videos feel immersive. It doesn't quite live up to the borderless Aquos Crystal experience, but there is no light leakage on this screen and it does better at an angle. Also, the screen responds well to the touch, even with a tempered-glass protective covering over it. That is something that cannot be said with the Sharp Aquos Crystal.Sound:I never realized how much having the front-facing speakers would improve the quality of gaming and video experiences. Being able to lay down the phone and watch a video without the output sounding muffled or indistiguishable from gibberish is awesome. I find myself watching videos on my phone more than ever because of the audio features. Additionally, the included JBL earbuds are a nice touch and the JBL Mix audio app is one of the coolest I have ever used. I honestly find myself making playlists just to work on my mixing and transitions between tracks. Just check out some videos on youtube to see the app for itself because honestly a description here won't do justice to how fun the app is.Operating System and features:Comes out of the box with lollipop and just updated to version 5.0.2 today. As with any android phone customization is really limitless so I won't spend time on that here. The reversible feature is pretty neat, and merits me echoing other reviews. If it was not for the button placement or the design of my screen protector there would be times when I pull my phone out of my pocket and have no idea it was upside-down. The fluidity with how it works really stands out for functionality, and I am suprized this has not been a feature in phones prior to the Idol 3.Battery Life:There are phones that will get you longer battery life, but I have never been able to kill my phone in just one day of daily use. I am not implying that it will be at 30% when you wake up the next day, but it is definitely an upgrade over my first gen Moto X. Not having to find a charger immediately when I get home from work provides a little more freedom to the daily grind. I know that usage varies by person, but outside of gamers I don't think moderate to light users will have too many gripes about battery life.Conclusion:Buy this phone. If you want a great experience at a great price, buy this phone. One of my best decisions in a while to take the plunge. Being an unlocked phone carrying no carrier bloatware and built in apps like Mix, File Explorer and Wifi Display actually adding to the experience, Im starting to see less and less reason to ever sign up for a carrier contract again. If you need financing options, there is an Amazon store card for that. At $250 though, you won't find yourself in much of a financial bind if you decide to pick one up."
"Alcatel",5,"Nice phone, so far !!!"
"Alcatel",5,"Honestly, I love this phone. I bought mine from Amazon Warehouse. Although it was used. It preforms well but my package didn't come with the jbl headphone, just apple headphones. As for most users, battery is a main concern. My idol 3 gets about four to five hours of screen one time. I would like to state I am a heavy battery user. Bluetooth enabled most of time for my moto 360 and Bluetooth devices. Data also enabled for couple hours. For my opinion, this is an average phone, battery wise. Buy a fast charger for this phone as it only comes with a standard alcatel charger. The NFC and the Gyroscope sensor work very well for VR streaming. On board speakers are greatly better than most phones due to the dual front facing features. The camera is just good. Nothing to write home about. I highly advise y'all to buy the ""A better camera unlocked"" app. There is also a free version if y'all are into that. The app will make the camera in par with the iPhone cameras. If y'all are wondering about the double tap to wake feature. I'd like to say it works but only with the one touch launcher. It might just be a software issue with the marshmallow upfate. Hope alcatel fixes it soon. As of now. I use nova launcher with the knock lock app and the gravity lock app. Works well in unison.Overall. Great phone for the $200 mark. I did get mine used and for cheaper the price. Nothing bad. Hope this review helped your decision to consider this phone. Thanks bye bye"
"Alcatel",5,"High quality & features at a low cost. Love it!"
"Alcatel",5,"Got updated to Marshmallow on 6/15!!!"
"Alcatel",5,"Great for the price or any price you can think of."
"Alcatel",4,"Had to return, wouldn't maintain quality signal in my area. To bad because I saw the potential and the sound quality on wi-fi was fantastic!"
"Alcatel",1,"Great Phone. Reliable. Fast. All you expect the reviews it to be until... the phone reaches 0%. I Tried recharging the phone for more then 3-4 hours and won't hold a charge. I would hold the power button for more then 20 seconds and no response, just the led light. I looked up the issue and it could be one of two problems. The firmware might be setting the phone to hibernation or there might be a loose connection with the power button and socket. I didn't want to void my warranty so I replaced the phone through amazon.I waited another 4 days for a new phone and the phone seemed fine, but the led light would constantly flash even when all apps and notifications were turned off. I let the phone go down to 0% again at work and tested if the phone would be able to turn back on again. I charged it for 5-6 hours this time and no responsive. The led light would turn on when charging and that would be it. I don't know if its my bad luck but i will be replacing it one last time. If it is true then the phone is only good to hold one charge! Don't let it drain out completely or it won't turn on."
"Alcatel",1,"This is the second ALCATEL OneTouch Idol 3. Set it up and shut it off and you'll not be able to use the device again! Going the Wallmart tomorrow and if the Sim Card does'nt fix it, it's going back the amazon! One star because no lower option."
"Alcatel",1,"I really wanted to like this phone. I looked up the specs, read the reviews and searched online for the best phone for my money. I decided this was the phone to get, everyone raved about it. They said it was the best phone under $300, blah blah you've probably seen all that too. Lets start with the good. It has a pretty decent camera and a nice big screen... that's about it. I consider myself to be a simple man, if I buy something, its because it's supposed to serve a purpose. This phone froze all of the time, not only did I experience the stutter others experienced, but it froze and it crashed often. At first I thought it was my fault, so I cleared all of my cache, deleted useless folders, downloaded cleaner apps etc. but nothing worked, the phone kept freezing, crashing, and rebooting itself when I was in the middle of things. I've had this phone about two weeks now and I've had it. In a rage, I twisted the phone in my hands until I had shattered the LCD, screen and mangled the housing. It felt awesome. All in all, I should have known better this phone was released in 2014 and we're living in 2016. Two years in the tech industry is a lifetime... don't make the mistake I made. If you hate freezing, unresponsive, garbage cell phones, DON'T buy this product."
"Alcatel",2,"1 year into having the Idol 3 5.5...I wish I would've bought a Moto X Pure. When it works, it works fine. I've had to do a couple factory resets, I've had to send it off to be repaired when the screen popped off the body, and now it won't stay locked on a cell or data signal, so it's back into the repair shop. Again. Spend the extra money and get something more reliable."
"Alcatel",4,"love it can't wait for the Idol 4"
"Alcatel",4,"Much better than I thought. Nice phone!."
"Alcatel",5,"Great phone. Mom loves it as a replacement for her Moto G. Love the stock version of Android -- it's super fast and smooth and the screen is perfect in quality and size for her."
"Alcatel",5,"i love it"
"Alcatel",5,"This phone is absolutely excellent. I have had it over a month now and it receives excellent coverage for T-Mobile on the Dallas and Austin Texas areas. The phone is very light and feels very nice to hold. The speakers are excellent and the headphones sound amazing but I have trouble keeping them in my ears even after changing the earbud inserts. Phone streams MLB.TV on the LTE network with no issues which was one of the main things I was hoping for. Battery life is excellent, I am not a hardcore phone user but it lasts me 2 days without charging which includes the mlb app, clash of clans, and facebook/google hangouts messaging. If you are looking for a new phone and not wanting to spend a fortune this phone is perfect choice. I have had no latency issues with the 5.0 Android build with it like I read. The screen is very vibrant and looks amazing.Cons: Like to pocket dial a lot but I heard Android is famous for that with emergency calling. No Camera button on the sides, I was very accustomed to it on my Nokia Lumia 925. Only 2 pages for shortcuts to apps, not sure if that is able to be changed or not. The double tap screen isn't as responsive as my wife's Sony Xperia. But I can live with those cons.I am not an Android fan boy and this is my first Android phone I converted from a Windows phone (Which I also loved.) I have to say all in all I would highly recommend this phone."
"Alcatel",5,"It's hard to believe that such a good phone is available at this price. I was using a Note 2 and fell in love with the large screen size. I love the SD slot, which is why I won't get a new Note, Samsung has lost me. The front facing speakers are great, I wish every mobile device had this. The screen is vibrant. It is fairly close to a stock Android experience. I like the camera, I have no problem using this instead of my ""real"" camera in most cases. Being unlocked is a must for me now.I would definitely recommend this phone. I see no reason to pay the flagship prices when a phone like this can do everything I need, I would not consider myself a ""power user"" though."
"Alcatel",5,"I've had this phone for about 2 months and really have had no problems with it. I admit that I am a fairly light user, and mainly use it as a phone. I can go at least 4-5 days between charges, honestly up to a week....Reception is better than my previous phones (Samsung & Sony phones) and wifi strength is comparable. There had been some camera issues (the main one for me being battery drain) but that's been improved. The ""tap to turn on"" feature works reliably now, the screen is beautiful, and it's fast with web and google play store browsing.The button locations may be a problem for some, but I find I use it upside down just as much as right side up. Since always use my phone left handed because I am doing something else (like writing or unlocking a door) with my dominant hand, it's nice to have those buttons where they are.... My hands are pretty small but dexterous so a little ""shimmy"" is not a problem given my case.I have only dropped it once-- it has no chips or scratches.Could not be more pleased at this point, but I don't think that my use is typical. However it TOTALLY works for me... NOW (good updates)."
"Alcatel",5,"This is a great phone. I'm not sure why they call this a mid range phone when the specs are the same/if better than the Galaxy line, M8 from HTC, etc."
"Alcatel",2,"The phone is very decent for its price. But as with cheap products, there is always a downfall.1. The phone has gotten visibly slower than when it came. It has been only around two months and already its speed has decreased by a certain amount.2. This issue is the more disappointing one: The back squeaks and clicks when you press against it. This probably means that the back cover has gotten loose somehow. I have never dropped the phone, nor do I use it roughly. I am very gentle with it, and only after 1 month of use (the other month was spent on a trip), the back is already loose. I am very disappointed and the return period is already over.I was very hopeful for this smartphone, but it seems that there is a reason why higher end phones are priced the way they are."
"Alcatel",5,"Possibly the best all around budget smartphone. I love this phone but its removable battery and large body size isnt for everyone. I like this phone for everything it has."
"Alcatel",5,"For the prize its wonderfull"
"Alcatel",5,"I personally can't imagine needing to anything beyond this phone's capabilities. It handles everything I ask of it; combinations of texting, phone calls, Youtube, GPS, streaming video and audio services. I've read that the phone can bog down when you multitask too much with it, but I haven't noticed this with my usage. I use this phone which Cricket Wireless (which I would also recommend).Pros:-Screen is great (in brightness and picture quality).-Battery lasts the day unless I do really push it.-Speakers are crisp and decently loud.-The phone is responsive in processing tasks.-The rear camera takes decent pictures under any conditions I've tried.-The cost.Cons-Call quality could be a little better (this may be Cricket's fault) but the quality is good enough to not be an issue.-I wish the speakers were louder; I can't hear audio if I leave the phone on outside of the shower. I realize this is a pretty needy desire that I have.-The stock texting app is pretty terrible. I didn't use it long because one of its ""features"" is to set the date of all group texts to someday in 1970 which causes the message to auto sort to the bottom of the inbox list. Fortunately the Google Messaging app is free and a good replacement.-Bloatware. There isn't a ton of it relative to other phones but it still drives me crazy that I can't delete apps such as the aforementioned terrible texting app.-The screen seems overly sensitive (i.e. often selecting links as I try to scroll through a webpage). However, this may be due to my screen protector. However, I do find it very easy to click small links or buttons accurately.-The front camera isn't the best, but selfies are for nerds.Overall, I can't recommend this phone enough. I can't see a reason to spend more on a different phone. Most of my complaints were easily resolved or not that problematic. I will absolutely look at whatever the latest Alcatel offering is in a few years when it is time for a new phone."
"Alcatel",5,"I love this phone so far. A few weeks ago my oneplus one had started to have some issues and I wasn't able to fix it... so I started looking for a new phone. I bought the moto x pure.... it was ok but for the price it wasn't as nice as my oneplus one and I also didn't like how flimsy the buttons were.. so I returned that and tried the blu life one XL which was supposed to be decent (I've had a blu phone in the past and liked it)... I tried it and it was sooo slow.. so that went back. After researching I was torn between the idol3 and the zenfone2... both have great reviews. I chose the idol because of the speakers on front and I'm glad I did. The phone feels great in the hand. Call quality so far is good even in my house and the speakers sound great. The screen is clear (I would suggest pushing the display brightness up a bit) and the reverse call feature is pretty cool. (You can set a feature to have the phone screen to rotate no matter how you are holding it) The only thing that I don't like is the power button is hard to reach and I have long fingers."
"Alcatel",1,"I purchased my phone July 2015 it's a ok phone my review is not about the phone but there customer service. Be aware that when you purchase this phone that there customer service is horrible. Beginning of October I had issues with my Sd and Sims slot not reading. I contacted Alcatel concerning the problem and was told I would have to send my phone in to be repaired for 15 days. When I asked why so long and I quote their customer service person said "" I sent you the email so do what you want"". I complained on Twitter the Alcatel company contacted me about the problem saying they needed more information it's been a week still have not spoken to anyone or gotten help with this problem. Horrible customer service horrible phone. I guess you pay for what you get! 😫👎🏽😡😡😡😡😡. Final verdict all Alcatel could for me was offer me a free shipping label. If you purchase this product and it breaks you have to send it in to there repair center. They did not offer to replace the phone or even send a refurbish phone. Phone in the garbage like there company is garbage. I would not buy this phone."
"Alcatel",4,"This is a very capable phone. The screen is quite good, and it handles most of my daily tasks without issue. I have found that the Outlook app occasionally slows down dramatically and is unusable, and requires the phone to be rebooted. But other than that, the battery life is adequate for a full day under moderate-to-heavy use, even when travelling, and I have encountered no red flags with this device. It's a pleasure to use and a good value for the money."
"Alcatel",5,"This phone is absolutely amazing. I use it everyday and its funny because all my friends have the latest iphone... Well im not really a swing vote on Android vs Apple, but this phone In my opinion is equivalent to the Iphone 6, same size, same camera, same speed. Literally almost all the specifications are there except this one you can have a much bigger memory slot, since its changeable. And its 3x cheaper. I read multiple reviews on different phones, and This one is the best buy for its buck. the 4.7 inch screen is Okay, if you have the money go buy that one, but if you have the extra money, just buy this one. I also recommend a case for this, since without one its slick as ice in your hand."
"Alcatel",3,"I have had it for 2 months now. It definitely is a great phone, but does have some shortfalls. The phone is well built and although made of plastic, does feel like a very good solid build - almost as solid as an Iphone, without the weight. Screen is good, although I tend to keep my brightness at 60% to get a comparable display to my iphone. The colors are not as luch as my iphone - a tad washed out but after a while you dont even notice. the sound of the external speakers is amazing! I love it. the sound of the phone with headphones/earphones, both good quality and the ones it came with it, is good - but very low - no matter what app i use to watch videos/hear music, i find it to be a little low for my taste. The vanilla OS is awesome, but after installing just a few apps and 2 months use, the phone now feels very sluggish and and slow.. I find myself constantly having to clean my ram etc. For the price point, its OK.. I think it should cost a little lower considering other phones out there in the under $200 range which easily outperform this device. my true love and reason for buying this phone is the thickness and feel of it... besides that, didnt fine much special about it. Also, my phone appeard to be a 're-pack' as the box was not sealed, and my headphones were defective. I called Alcatel support for an exchange on the headphones and they were very nice and said they will simply send me out a new pair. That was two months ago, i never got anything. I still have to call them again. sux i have to chase them down for something I purchased (supposedly) brand new. the 3 stars however are for the phone, and have nothing to do with the headphone/used phone experience."
"Alcatel",3,"Screen capture button is horrible, same button as power on. Screen brightness is another issue. Hard to take pics while outdoors in sun shine. Good batteries, great camera, fast processor,awesome speakers for music..."
"Alcatel",5,"I really love the phone, Excellent screen, nice camera and great audio.The battery last the whole day."
"Alcatel",5,"This is an amazing phone. Screen res., processing/multi-tasking power, and the camera is awesome too! But the coolest thing, is that it has dual speakers, dual mics so no matter how you grab it the screen and mic/speaker sync to how you hold the phone! No longer do you have to fiddle with your smartphone, feeling for buttons so you can make sure it's right-side-up. It always is thanks to the programming and speakers. It is loud and music and even headphone quality tops my old iphone 4s. Worth it."
"Alcatel",5,"I ordered this phone after seeing the advertisements on tv and I love it!! I was in a desperate state after my previous phone was forced to update to Lollipop after several years of running flawlessly. Unfortunately, Lollipop did not agree with my phone and within an hour I had a nonfunctioning brick. The Alcatel ONETOUCH is by far the best phone I've had and really saved my bacon because my other option was a $600+ phone that I really couldn't afford. Yes, I will admit it takes some getting use to. It's touchy, so when searching on the internet you can accidentally open multiple pages when scrolling, within a few days I was able to figure out the sweet spot on the screen to get around this problem. The sound quality is good which is a problem I read other people had. Picture quality is awesome so far. I've only had the phone for a few months so it's not like I've been in many situations to test the camera's limits, but for day to day use it's pretty solid. When I took this phone to get a new SIM card the tech guy raved on and on about how great the specs are and how it's such a great deal. I can't really speak for that because I have no idea what the specs are in comparison to others. He fiddled with it for a few minutes and in that time 3 people who were trying to get new phones left to order this one. It really is the best deal out there. I was slightly worried about how it would respond to my network (t-mobile) but it runs perfectly. I have no complaints and have recommended it to everyone I know. In fact my mom and dad were due for an upgrade and I order these for them and they love them too."
"Alcatel",5,"Great screen, great camera, great audio and great design. Even better with nova launcher after the update :)"
"Alcatel",5,"recommend"
"Alcatel",5,"Just too good for the money paid. Speakers are awesome and phone is very slim and lightweight with attractive design."
"Alcatel",4,"GOOD SMART PHONE GOOD PRICE VERY GOOD SOUND"
"Alcatel",5,"Let me start by clarifying the title. While this device may not match up to the current flagships on the market, keep in mind that this is last year's model. Going from an LG G4 to this phone, the only noticeable downgrade was the camera and the non removable battery. That being said, the camera is still better than all of my older flagships except that one, and while the battery isn't replaceable, it still outlasts what my G4 would with the same usage. I sell phones for a living and as a bit of a phone enthusiast, I've used every major brand of phone either for personal use or I've set them up or performed troubleshooting for customers. Alcatel is a brand that I've seen very hit or miss devices come from, so I was a bit leary buying one. I have to say I don't regret it one bit. At the new price of $99 it's a no brainer. If you're looking for a phone that gets stuff done for under $200, this is it. The sound is fantastic, the processor is very snappy even though it's not the very top of the line snapdragon. The phone's design is brilliant and it looks and feels great. There is no real bloatware other than all of the Google apps, and the launcher is clean and very close to pure android. As with any phone, don't forget protection. It will last for you as long as you don't abuse it, and Alcatel does stand behind their warranty so if it does happen to malfunction they will fix it. This phone is what I've been waiting years for. You can't get a better phone at this price point."
"Alcatel",4,"This is a really nice Android smartphone. There is a software update that brings Android 6.0.1. It's not a gaming smartphone, but for a day basics stuff it's perfect.The only downside is the lack of system languages. I live in America, I talk english, but will be nice to use the device in my native language."
"Alcatel",4,"Love this phone and great piece of hardware"
"Alcatel",5,"The device was everything I wanted at a very low budget price. I couldn't believe it was real until I actually saw it.. amazing featured too"
"Alcatel",5,"Excellent quality for the value. Good product. Just buy together with a screen protector and you will be fine."
"Alcatel",5,"Here it is fast and honest. Camera is low quality, not garbage but it's passable. Charges kind of slow too. The star here is audio, these front facing speakers are gold. The phone runs good with minimal lag. I love the way it looks. I intend to buy the newer version after using this little gem. I'd buy it again if it broke tomorrow. Such a beastly media consumption device!"
"Alcatel",2,"I bought this phone as a Christmas gift for my daughter. It's only the middle of May, 5 months after she got it, and the phone is already having charging problems, power on and off issues. She takes good care of her things and does not abuse them. We've both been very frustrated with it. We like the big screen, sound quality, and specs it promised, but the issues I mentioned are driving us away from ever trusting the Alcatel brand again. Not to mention, this is not the first Alcatel phone I own that I have issue with. I had dealt with the Alcatel Onetouch Fierce's sound quality going bad and touch screen not responding in the past after owning it for only about half a year. I thought I'd give them another try due to all the raving and good reviews. The Alcatel brand failed me once again."
"Alcatel",3,"Had phone since November about 3 or 4 months using this phone the power button has become unresponsive and is not fully functional"
"Alcatel",5,"As described, arrived on time. Great features in the phone. Camera is very high quality."
"Alcatel",2,"This phone worked great for 6 months. The battery life was phenomenal, the systems were all simple to use, no issues. Then, the nightmare began. At first, the battery would die once it hit 95%. I would have to put the phone back on the charger and wait for it to reboot up and charge back up to 100, then less than an hour later it would happen again. Eventually it stopped allowing me to do anything at all. Alcatel has no real support, save a call number that will not do anything for you. I tried replacing the battery, but same issue continued. I took it into a local repair shop and after three weeks they gave it back to me and refunded all charges, telling me that it must be a software issue, because the battery and charging ports work fine. However, because Alcatel doesn't have any real customer troubleshooting or service, I have no way to fix it. There is a reason people buy from trusted companies with well established reputations for troubleshooting and repairs. Save yourself the headache and get a Moto G or just sell your soul and get an IPhone. You shouldn't have to drop $250 on something that'll last less than six months."
"Alcatel",4,"Excellent phone, but I dropped and broke it the same day it arrived."
"Alcatel",5,"I am very happy with this new phone to'm fine now good only bad thing that the battery can not be changed but I'm happy with my new idol acatel 3 graces."
"Alcatel",2,"Alcatel is slow on up dates, it appears they will not update to 5.1, setting the stage for a dead end phone. Does not support wifi calling. They have gone out of their way of preventing rooting, u can root, then your out of luck if u want to revert. They mess with partition lock. Okay phone, other then alcatel's anal approach to prevent custom o.s"
"Alcatel",5,"Hello! After around 6 full months of owning this phone, I'd like to share my 2 cents.I bought this back in October and I am an AT&T costumer. It was a simple process of transferring my SIM card form my previous (much older smartphone) to this new Alcatel Idol 3. I had bought a 64gb memory card to go along with it and again, the installation was super simple and really easy. Both the SIM and memory card sit side-by-side like buddies in a tray that pops in and out of the phone using a thin wire -- such as a paperclip.Anyway, down to the phone itself. I love it. It has met and exceeded my needs and I've used it A LOT in these six months. Like a lot a lot. Everyday for a few hours at least. I do everything from playing games on it, surfing the web, playing videos (lots of youtube!), playing music, reading articles, and of course, calling and texting -- because it's a phone.Here is what I absolutely LOVE about this phone:- The screen. Oh boy the screen. This thing has a beautiful, incredibly BRIGHT screen. I actually have it on the lowest brightness setting, because anything higher than that it is too bright haha. It's really a gorgeous screen. Full HD, 401ppi. Looks great. Again, can get VERY bright.- The RAM and processor. The combination of these two have met my needs with hardly any problems. I've had multiple, high-demanding apps running in the background (games, YouTube, Torrent clients) and the phone does well to keep up with what I throw at it. It does slow down eventually and can appear like it's struggling, but I can imagine that'd be the case with any device after meeting its threshold.- The speakers! I don't use them much, but man oh man when I do, they're a joy. This phone has excellent front facing speakers that really do fill a room. I use this phone for my alarm and every morning hearing this thing blast away some beautiful sounding tunes is a real treat to wake up to.- Build quality. This is not only a nice-looking phone, but if feels well built and constructed. Quite a bit nicer than the price-tag would hint at. I was, and am, thoroughly impressed with it. I've managed to take good care of it, so there's no noticeable scratches on both the backside and the screen. And none have randomly appeared.- The battery! Oh jeez. So when I say that I use this phone A LOT. I sure mean it, and this battery holds up REALLY well. On the way to work, at work, and upon arriving back at home I am usually left with a good chunk of battery life -- 30-40%. It very rarely dips below 20% on a given day, which is freakin' awesome.Things I like about it, but could be better:- It's thin and lightweight. I was super surprised by how thin and light it was and actually very nervous about handling it. However, upon buying and putting on a decent size case which added a little bulk to it, the phone size is just about perfect. But I wouldn't mind it being a bit heavier and maybe a touch thicker, just so if I did end up dropping it I wouldn't feel like it would explode.- The Camera. This takes a bit of trial and error, such as finding an appropriate app that will utilize the camera to it's fullest. The camera is not ""oh wow! Look at that!"" great when I first used it. I had to get accustomed to where and how it worked best. For example, it's not great in low-light environments. Taking a picture at night? Uh, forget about it. It's rough times. But in daytime, with lots going on and lots of things to focus on, the camera does surprisingly well and can -- on occasion -- take some truly spectacular pictures. But those times are few and far between. So I'd recommend finding a different phone if you really want a nice camera on a phone, BUT for the most part this guy does the trick -- just be a bit prepared for figuring out its limitations. Also, the front-facing ""selfie"" camera is surprisingly nice! The few selfies I've taken have turned out better than I'd like to admit!- The pre-installed launcher. Eh, it's not great, but it's not terrible. It can get sluggish and doesn't look the best. There are other options out there that are far better. Also, many of the pre-installed apps sort of fall into the same boat. They're not great, but they're not terrible. I really wish the file managed was better though, because it seems to be the only app that you can voluntarily copy and move files between the internal storage and the micro sd card. Ugh, I think that might be an android issue though...- Sound quality, internal audio amp/driver. Now, I ain't no audiophile or anything like that, but I do appreciate a nice sounding device paired with a nice set of earphones. This phone, similar to its camera, gets the job done, but again there isn't that ""wow! Listen to this!"" feeling. I wasn't buying the phone for its audio capabilities -- internal audio driver -- but with it's awesome external speakers and its partnership (somewhat) with JBL I have to say that I was expecting more. I've used a number of apps with different audio files, but I've owned past devices that have sounded significantly better. Anyway, it's no deal-breaker, but it is a thing and if you're looking for a device with great sound quality, I'd look elsewhere.Overall, I am super happy with this phone. I bought it back when it was $250, and I am shocked it has dropped down to $200. It's a steal at that price. It really is. It's no flagship, IPhone destroyer, but it gets the job done with battery to spare! I really do like it and I think if you're an AT&T costumer looking for a new smartphone for a smart price, then this is it. Everything I've asked it to do -- both usual and ugh...unusual hahah -- it has executed well.If you do end up getting it, here are a few parting recommendations:- purchase a 64gb micro sd card. They're cheap, awesome, and easy to install- Get a case! It makes the phone a bit bigger and easier to handle. I don't like screen protectors, so I can't speak about those.- Look into finding a camera app for the phone. I bought one on Google PlayStore called Cameringo+Effects and I really like it. Just make sure to set it to HD pictures. It'll seem like it has a smaller viewing screen, but the quality of the photos are a TON better than the default picture quality on the app.- Look into finding a different launcher for the phone. I got Nova Launcher Prime and it makes the phone's interface speedier and more user-friendly, and you can customize it off the wazoo.Alright, well that's my 2 cents on this phone. Overall, I think it's great and at $200, it's quite the stealio."
"Alcatel",5,"So far I really like my phone. Larger than I was thinking it would be, but getting used to that! I need a purse with a bigger phone pocket!"
"Alcatel",2,"I have had this phone almost one year in about two weeks. I wrote a review on Alcatel's website. To my dismay when I checked back on the review I wrote and how may stars I gave it, had been altered. The stars had been bump up from two to four stars and what I wrote edited by shortening the bad part of the review. I was absolutely disgusted. The phone itself is not bad for the price but the customer service is not good at all. I have heard similar complaints. And the complaints stem from questions to do with updates to the phone. The phone came with Lollipop 5.0. They do not respond when asked by customers regarding updates to the phone. Not on their website, Facebook or speaking to them. Speak to them on updates and they have no answer for you. Because of that I will never buy this phone again."
"Alcatel",5,"Excellent phone for the price. I went to this from the LG Nexus 5, and I'm pretty sure the Idol 3 outperforms it on every level. Very satisfied with this phone."
"Alcatel",4,"Synopsis:I like it. it's not blowing me away, but for the price I knew it couldn't be perfect. I had to return one due to issues caused by an OTA system update, and the second one has a crackly headphone port, but otherwise it's been great. A fantastic alternative to the ""deals"" offered by the major carriers (I'm lookin at you, AT&T Next)The Phone: The Bad:Really just 1 thing: The headphone port is a little crackly. by that I mean if you plug in headphones, and nudge the the jack, the sound crackles, and you may lose audio in one ear until it sorts itself out. I know this may be a MUCH bigger issue for some people, but I've had devices with crackly headphone ports for years without failing, and really, I am rarely on the move with headphones on, and if I am, I'll be careful to make sure the jack isn't being jostled. I could return the phone again, but I'd have to take another refund and repurchase, and I'm not willing to have $600 tied up in pending Amazon refunds.The Good:Size:I was worried about the size initially. My old phone is a Galaxy 2 Skyrocket. It has a 4"" screen. I thought it was perfect. This took literally no time to get comfortable with. Yes, one hand operation is mostly gone, but it turns out that I don't even notice. It fits in pockets nicely and textured just enough to not be too slick.Screen:I'm no connoisseur of screens, but this thing seems excellent. In a dark room I actually wish it would dim a little more. No problems in full summer sun. colours, saturation and depth are great to my eyes.speakers:surprisingly good. Whatever they did with JBL worked. Similarly for the headphones. Far superior to any headphones I've ever gotten with a phone or music device.Reception:On par with my Samsung and my wife's Nokia Lumia. really like the notification for when I'm on LTE, H+, etc.Wifi:Like a few other devices ( XBox1), it doesn't seem to play well with my Comcast Xfinity home Wifi. Other places it's fine. That's a comcast issue.Camera:meh. it's got a lot of pixels and nice features, but images seem to be noisy when the lighting isnt perfect. My old Samsung was better. Supposedly better after the OTA update.Performance:smooth, fast. Gets a little hot with graphically intense games, but that's normal. Just a hair of lag when downloading/installing multiple apps. Nothing to fret over.UI:Less is more. It's simple, and seems just lightly massaged. preloaded apps are mostly what you'd want anyway.Battery:better than my old Samsung, I don't have a lot to put here. it holds up well to moderate use throughout the day."
"Alcatel",2,"This phone is probably the best for the price. It has a really bright screen, it's thin, has an sd card slot, fast processor, and front facing speakers. And it has nfc, which the new moto g, oneplus 2, and huawei p8 lite don't have. It's also going to be updated to get protected from the ""Stagefright"" bug soon. Nice to see a company caring about users.However....While this phone was in a bag it got cracked. There was a case on it but it still got cracked. The digitizer did not work so I shipped it to alcatel for repair and it is costing me $100 for them to fix it.So please buy a tempered glass screen, and don't put any pressure on the phone. I even noticed that if you press hard enough you will see spots, I guess from the lcd.If you are looking for a phone that doesn't crack easy and is similar price I recommend the OnePlus One. I've hade it with a small orzly fusion case and it isn't cracked. It does have a tempered glass on it but that's only been recently."
"Alcatel",4,"Not thrilled about tool to open ,but it's a good phone"
"Alcatel",4,"After using the phone as my daily driver for a month I can honestly say this is one of the best experiences you can have off a budget smart phone. I use the term budget for the description of the price range however the experience is that of a flagship phone. In this review I will talk about the design, hardware, usability, and daily experience of the phone.DesignIts not secret that at this price range you are going to get a plastic phone. With that aside its one of the nicest builds. It have a solid but light feel in the hand. The back is make of a matte metallic sheen that is pleasant to the touch and is not slick and will not attract finger prints. Another note is that the back of the phone is completely flat including the camera does not protrude from the body of the phone. Their is a nice chrome lip all the way around the edge front and back that breaks up the black and gray quite tastefully. Lastly the phone is completely symmetrical. The top and bottom are completely identical with the exception of the excellent front camera and photo-sensor and there is a reason for it. I'll explain more in the experience section.HardwareDespite the price this prince is running a Snapdragon 615 octa-core with 4 cores at 1.5ghz and the other 4 at 1.0ghz and 2GB of ram. It has wifi with 5ghz band and 2.4ghz support. I can say that the wifi works well and has great range (helps if you have a good router as well). LTE is band 12 capable for those who will be using T-Mobile. The rear facing camera is a 13 megapixel Sony sensor with a 8 megapixel front facing camera but shoot at 4:3 aspect ratio. If you want 16:9 HD photos the sensor will go bring the pixel count down to 9.4 mega pixel and 5.1 on the front camera. The display is a bright and beautiful 5.5 inch IPS HD display running at 1920x1080P with 401 pixels per inch. And to tight everything together are JBL powered stereo speakers with 2 microphones one on top and bottom of the phone. All that powered by a 2915mah battery.UsabilityI had a Motorola X (2013) which made usability far better than any phone with its gestures and touchless command prompts beyond what OK Google can do. After having that experience its hard for any phone to compete with that. Going from a 4.7 inch display to a 5.5 inch was quite a jump however thanks to the minimal bezels its make it easy to use. I have small hands and reaching across the screen to the left and the top was a little hard put its still possible. The stereo speakers make it a harder because of the extra bezel it creates still nothing compared to the LG G3 or I phone 6 plus for that matter. The phone is very thin and light making completely unnoticeable in my pocket compared to the weight and thickness of my Moto X. Having the big and bright display with stereo speakers made every media experience amazing. The sound was rich and crystal clear, with good highs and mids, low lows but still better than any other phone out there. The photo-sensor works really well with its software. The screen always had the right amount of brightness, never to much indoors in the dark and you can see the display clearly in direct sunlight not problem. The front facing camera is just a dream with selfies (not that I do much) but video chatting and conferencing is just amazing. Google hangouts is a power app and the phone handles it not problem streaming HD and close to 30fps on a good internet connection. The display also runs at 60fps and drops a bit when moving around but its not even noticeable unless you are watching a fps monitoring software.ExperienceThe as a whole runs pretty smooth about 90% of the time. There are delays in opening apps in comparison to the top flagship phones but its only .5 sec behind in opening apps compared to the galaxy S6 or i Phone 6 plus. Once the app is open or in the ram it responds instantly with no lag. The home screen, multi-task bar, and quick setting menu from the top are lag free. Honestly its runs almost as well as any flagship to the point where you question why you are paying $700+ for a phone. The delay is never frustration or interfering with your task but its noticeable compared to the top flagships. I actually found myself preferring my phone speakers over my Bluetooth speakers because of the clarity was far superior. The phone is running a stock 5.0 android experience with an icon pack install with the Acatel launcher. I actually just installed the google now launcher for a more complete stock look. Not a fan of the bright looking icons on the Acatel launcher. The camera is a pretty awesome however the stock camera app is a flop. The image processing is horrible. I installed the google camera app and it did a much better job with the camera and image processing plus it gives you the ability to change aspect ratio and megapixel options. After all this the batter is a big plus. Its a true all day battery with normal usage and even powers users can get a good amount of usage before needing to charge. I was able to get 6.2 Hrs of on screen time watching Netflix through wifi. When power using during the day I got 4-5 hrs of on screen time. Over all if you want a flagship phone without the flagship price brand new, this is it. There is nothing that compares with it."
"Alcatel",5,"I've only had this phone for 48 hours. It took less than 24 (including sleep) to have it set up with my favorite stuff. I continually use bluetooth and I'm REALLY active on my phone. Multiple email accounts and multiple active social media accounts. I can still get a full business day, plus some, on a single charge. Despite also still spending lots of time tweaking.It's said the camera may not be up to those of the flagship phones. I haven't tried the camera, yet, to verify that. But keep in mind that the flagships sell between $500-800+ and the Idol 3 is $250. One would expect a difference. Likewise, with the software. Some things have a perceptible difference in opening speed, but not enough to call them slow. And accessories are limited.In contrast, connections are stronger and faster than any previous device I've owned. I happen to live in an area where signal is weak and maybe a little flakey. There are hills and lots of brick homes blocking the two closest towers. Both cell and wifi are faster and cell strength is better. And it handles a 128 gig microsd card.The Idol 3 isn't a flagship killer. But, at the price, one would expect ""good enough"". And it's much closer to flagship than ""good enough"". If you need the fastest and the best, get a flagship. If you want a smartphone that can stand on its own merits, but allows you to spend your money on more important things, this is what you want."
"Alcatel",5,"This phone is awesome. Best battery life on any phone I've ever used and I've used alot of them. The battery tends to last me 3 days with light use and 2 with heavy. The cameras are both pretty impressive for the price, the processor handles every game I play without any hiccups but it does come off a little sluggish outside of the games. Aside from the icons, this phone is basically pure android. I've thoroughly enjoyed it, its the best electronic device I've ever paid 250 for but if you are pure android lover and a power user, you'll enjoy this as a back up to a nexus."
"Alcatel",5,"Great quality, great sound, and pure android Lollipop experience. I love the design and runs smother than my Samsung Galaxy S5, at half the price. Recommend to all android users if they want a great product."
"Alcatel",5,"I received my phone on yesterday and must first say I appreciate all the previous reviews that guided me to this purchase. I did some research on this phone including YouTube videos that compared this phone to other budget phones and flagships. This phone has met all of my expectations and then some! I saw remarks about the double tap not being consistent. I actually figured that out. If you do a slower tap it usually works every time. Maybe a quick could ""1,2"" works just about every time. The battery seems good so far. The display is outstanding. I downloaded open camera after a reviewer suggested which is good. My 2 most recent phones were the LG g4 and galaxy s6. The s6 is certainly a great piece of equipment but I realized many of the features they offer I don't need and the price is just too much. I definitely recommend this device over any other android on the market. Even some iPhone users might like this as a temporary, secondary or converter back to the android platform."
"Alcatel",5,"This is a great android phone at a nice price. I love mine."
"Alcatel",5,"I've had this phone for five days. I love it! The screen is crisp and clear. The sound is unbelievable! It's very thin and easy to manage. You can't go wrong buying this amazing phone. Hubby convinced me to choose this one and I'm glad he did!"
"Alcatel",5,"This is a review after one week of usage. As a baseline for the review, I am not a power user. I only use it for phone calls, texting, checking email, and surfing when I'm not near a computer. For these purposes and needs, this phone is great (so far):- Phone is thin and light. Slim case serves my needs because does not add bulk but still adds protection- Phone looks visually nice (compared to direct competitors like the Zenfone and One Plus)- Screen is big and bright- Sound is way better with two front facing speakers- Battery life lasts the whole day with some to spare- Camera is good (enough). Good for impromptu moments. Don't have high expectations and you will be very pleased with the resultsLag is relative. I don't mind a delay of a nano-second to see what I need or do what I want to do. Overall, I am happy (so far) of the purchase of this phone. It fits my needs perfectly with the price point, features, and aesthetics. I think the Idol 3 is worth more than the $250 retail price. The only difficult part is telling people what phone I have. Alcatel is not a household name, nor is it easy to pronounce. A lot of people ask me about the phone and telling them about Alcatel is the biggest hang up for me. However, I was with T-Mobile when they first started. I was also with Samsung from the beginning. Hopefully I'll hit again with Alcatel."
"Alcatel",5,"I love this smartphone is an excellent device."
"Alcatel",5,"The best phone in this price range"
"Alcatel",4,"Love this phone, it's different then the other phone I had but all in all it's great."
"Alcatel",4,"Sweet phone, great volume but had Wii issues."
"Alcatel",5,"Realy gooooddd"
"Alcatel",5,"Amazing phone thats lightweight, thin, comfortable, and has a beautiful display, loud front facing speakers, fast processor, and nice premium desing. It foes get a little hot, but if you throw a case on it its fine. Also, the packaging is really nice. The included jbl headphones are really good"
"Alcatel",4,"Pros:* Price is tough to beat!* Very snappy - no speed issues.* Battery life is solid. With light use I regularly have about 55% battery left when I go to bed. I've not had it die on me yet.* SD card slot.* Not worrying about what side is up when you answer a call.* Very loud speakers with pretty high quality sound.Cons:* Camera is just okay. Works better in good lighting.* Can get a little warm when doing heavy processing.There aren't many cases for this phone it seems. In fact I ordered the window case and tempered glass with the phone when it was released, and neither actually shipped! (I got my money back of course.) The LK Ultra Slim case works pretty well and doesn't make it feel too thick.I switched from Verizon to AT&T prepaid with this phone.I would definitely recommend it!"
"Alcatel",5,"Have had the phone for 2 weeks and love it. Went from a Note 4 and IPhone 4s and don't miss them at all (OK, maybe the S Pen a bit). Screen is outstanding and performance is very good. Friends could not believe it's a $250 phone. Very light, so I do recommend a case. Using Straight Talk for a carrier and only complaint is a dropped cell signal occasionally. Still would purchase again."
"Alcatel",5,"Large display and thin and light body."
"Alcatel",2,"The big screen is nice, but the phone itself is so slow and sometimes shuts itself down which is really annoying. I also hate that the button to turn the screen on is on the left and the volume on the right. It's backwards from every other phone I've ever had."
"Alcatel",4,"Bought this for my mom for christmas she said she likes it. I guess if your looking for a good cheap phone then buy this phone."
"Alcatel",5,"Swag"
"Alcatel",5,"I've had this for a few months now and love it. Would not have chosen another phone."
"Alcatel",5,"Outstanding phone love the speed, screen, and speakers. Thin light big screen but I can still use it one handed.Screen is better than my last phone a high end Nokia with oled. Calls clear, haptic feedback on screen taps makes typing a breeze. EQ on speakers and headphones."
"Alcatel",3,"I preordered this found to use with my Ting service and I was loving it. Its a beautiful phone and I constantly had people asking me about it. However, mine seems to get hot very quickly watching videos and recently the battery expanded and has caused the phone to bend. It still works fine and battery life doesn't seem to have suffered but its very annoying ascetically. On top of that the ear buds that come with it already died on one side. I'd had this about 6 months, its disappointing for a phone I was so excited about and recommending to other until now."
"Alcatel",1,"Piece of crap, broke within 3 months with minimal ware. Customer service is terrible and no parts are available for the device.I wasted 200 bucks and i'm never buying anything from Alcatel again."
"Alcatel",5,"Received on time as promised in perfect condition. Set build quality and performance can not be beat at twice twice the price. Dual front facing speakers are great! Streaming videos flow smoothly along with web access. Email set up and contacts worked flawlessly. Battery life is good to excellent. My usage net a day and a half to two days before needing to recharge. On occasion have gotten into middle of third day. Unit out the box had Display set at about 60%. This looks great but I find that about 25% works for me.Should have purchased this set months ago.ALCATEL OneTouch Idol 3 Global Unlocked 4G LTE Smartphone, 5.5 HD IPS Display, 16GB (GSM - US Warranty)"
"Alcatel",5,"i love this phone. much better than other expensive brands full hd display, fast processor, hifi speakers jbl. and price is very sweet, i am ordering second phone alcatel, and suggest to you choose 5.5 inch, because it is full hd 1920x1080,instead 4.7inch which is 1280x720. between two models price difference is only 50$ but features are much more than 50$"
"Alcatel",5,"Good phone. Speaker is made for R&B Though. Metalheads beware"
"Alcatel",5,"Wow just WOW"
"Alcatel",5,"I purchased this after reading great reviews and I couldn't be more satisfied for the price. This phone's sound is unbelievable, and the screen is every bit as good as my Galaxy S4. Very lightweight for the large size. Love that I can add/change memory card via a pop-out tray on the side. One potential drawback for heavy phone users is nonremovable batter, but great for average phone use, music, podcasts and video. Good camera with plenty of options, too. Unlike some lower-priced phones, has latest version of Lollipop."
"Alcatel",5,"The best audio, the most vivid colors, fast enough, altough average camera (i didn't expect much about this last point because of the comments i read before i bought it)."
"Alcatel",5,"Awesome phone! Beats out a lot of the bigger brand names at an awesome price"
"Alcatel",5,"Super, super phone for the price. Well constructed, lightweight but sturdy."
"Alcatel",4,"Best budget phone ever. Has great display that pops, great signal and speed once I got 57 Mbps per second on T-Mobile but that also depends on coverage and where you live. I love it features sometimes I feel like I'm using a Nexus. No Andriod 5.1.1 yet but who cares you're getting a lot for your money! Sometimes I forget this is not a flagship. The camera is OK but honestly I think a software update will fix it since it's the same sensor in the one plus one. So if you have $250 get this phone!!!!!"
"Alcatel",2,"I've been using Amazon for almost a decade now. My household spends hundreds if not thousands on amazon purchases annually. I'm not a product review sort of guy. I typically just read through everyone else's comments to determine if a product is worthy or not. Amazon reviews have rarely steered me wrong. In this case I must make an exception and share my experience with the Alcatel one touch idol 3. I love everything about the phone.....except the quality of screen materials. It scratches, and I don't mean a little. I have had all types of phones over the years. Flagships to burners, but I have never experienced such a scratch prone one as the Alcatel. I ALWAYS use a case, but have never bothered with a screen protector since I am very careful with my electronics thus the screens remained pristine. I was very proud of my new bargain phone with flagship specs....until I noticed multiple scratches appear out of nowhere. They are increasing as well so the only possible conclusion is the phone was scratched by pulling it in and out of my pocket...seriously! Nobody else touches my phone, no kids, no pets, no nothing. Well the damage is done, I will put up with it I suppose as the other features of the phone are amazing. You have been warned, good luck my fellow shoppers!"
"Alcatel",3,"The performance on this phone is really choppy and it has a lot of lag. Your only able to play a few games without lag but graphic intensive games are going to lag you like crazy. I can't even play something like Dumb Ways to Die 2 without lagging incredibly and that game isn't even graphic intensive. Also, when I only use it for a few minutes it gets extremely hot to the touch on the back, even if I'm just browsing the web it will get really really hot to the point that it stings. The camera is okay...its not that great but it performs really well when there is good lighting but with bad lighting it's super blurry and there is really little detail. Opening apps is a pain in the ass because it takes forever for them to open. Just so you know it has a notification light but with only one color and the double tap to wake sometimes is really unresponsive. But two things that's extremely good about this phone is the speakers and the display. The speakers are extremely loud and the display is really sharp and the colors on the phone are pretty accurate has good contrast. The brightness on this phone when turned max is crazy bright and going outside in the sun won't be a worry when using this phone. I gave it a three instead of something lower because of the speakers and display. Oh yeah the headphones that this phone comes with is really awesome but you gotta be really careful around the tip of its plug thingy since if you bend it, it will break. That's what happened to mine. I only had it for a few months and its already broken so I can't even use it to listen and now I have to use my other headphones."
"Alcatel",2,"When I first got it I was blown away by the beautiful screen and incredible speakers. Upon using it for a few months now I have to say that it feels as slow as the Google Nexus (the dual core one by Samsung). The screen managed to develop a tiny yellow spot that seems like someone went over it with a highlighter that won't go away. Buttons are becoming increasingly unresponsive and a refresh of the device hasn't helped.Battery is very average.It's wonderful for watching/listening to shows as the screen still looks pretty decent, especially at that size, the speakers are great, and the included ear buds are pretty decent as well.Still, even after a month of owning this thing I was already disappointed it in. If you need a new phone, it's decent, especially at $250, but the interface is sluggish and unresponsive."
"Alcatel",5,"Got tired of having a contract and over paying for service with a lagy phone that I feel is over priced. This phone has delivered for me exactly what I need, keeps it simple with the OS and features, 2GB are enough for me and my multitasking, it came with an update right out of the box but I have yet to do it. Double tap to wake works, Thou spoty at times, but it works. Great front facing speakers that are loud and clear and the supplied headphones are just perfect. Camera is pretty good, for $250 you get more than what you pay for and the battery life is better than I was expecting, can't go wrong and I have bragged please type to people about this phone."
"Alcatel",1,"Originally I gave this phone a stellar review. However, this phone is a case of you get what you pay for. It stopped charging at 5 week. I just missed the amazon return policy window."
"Alcatel",5,"I decided to buy this phone on a whim after reading several early reviews. I'm glad I did. No, it's not perfect, but you have to consider what you get for your money. Other reviewers have gone into great detail about pros and cons so I won't repeat here. There are a few quirks, but in my opinion, the pros far outweigh the cons. I thought there was a problem with my external SD card when I couldn't access files on the card. It turned out my card was formatted in exFat. Once I formatted it to Fat32, all was well. When I was setting up my phone I somehow lost 2 screen panels and ended up with only one. I had to factory reset and that cured the problem. Also, sometimes the screen digitizer can be a little balky. The speakers are quite good as are the included earbuds. Maybe not as good as HTC's, but still good. The screen is very good for a phone at this price point. The camera was also a pleasant surprise. No, it won't beat the Galaxy S6 or iphone6, but you won't be disappointed either. I found no lag others have mentioned, but then again, I don't play games or launch multiple apps at once. For what I do, it was as smooth as butter. You will get through a day on the battery unless you are a heavy user. Unless you're a true perfectionist, I can't imagine anyone being disappointed with this phone when they consider it cost $250 for a no-contract, unlocked phone."
"Alcatel",5,"This phone is really good I recommended to anybody this is a gret phone for the prise"
"Alcatel",5,"Wow!! This is a well built phone with all the features from a premium phone. The phone is thin and easy to hold. The screen is bright and clear. The wifi access is good. The camera is decent too. The operating system is close to vanilla android with very little changes. This makes it a breeze to use. The User interface is fast and slick too. So lags what so ever. I did have a small issue with the tray that loads the sim and microsd card and I do not know if it was the SDcard or the tray that was was slightly out of proportions."
"Alcatel",5,"This Phone is really good.Its been few weeks that i bought this phone. I am very satisfied.Thanks for the awesome Amazon Services."
"Alcatel",5,"Not bad for the money. It actually has a feel of a premium high end phone."
"Alcatel",4,"Over all, it's a decent phone, but there's some downsides to it.1. The camera is not going to beat any of the flagship cameras or really any dedicated digital camera.2. It does get hot from time to time (it seems there's similar reports for phones running the Snapdragon 615 chip, so that's the likely culprit).3. Although the screen is very bright, I've noticed it seems washed out from time to time.Aside from these downsides, I think it's still a decent phone over all. Call quality has been good for me. The phone has been plenty fast for most of my tasks which center around web surfing and checking out Facebook. And the battery life is much better than my ancient S3. Over all, it's a phone I would buy again even if Alcatel doesn't provide regular updates (so far according to Reddit it can be rooted and the boot loader seems to be unlocked, so if you feel like experimenting with Cyanogenmod, it may be worth the trouble) in respect to the price."
"Alcatel",5,"I was looking for a good but affordable phone in March/April of this year and I knew already I would have to buy a used or refurbashed phone. Good but cheap phones just do not exist, until now. Alcatel's usual fare is cheap and lackluster POS's with poor hardware. With the Idol 3 Alcatel has decided to up it's game and came out with their new flagship[ phone. Granted it's no high end flagship killer but for the money you get quite a bit of tech.The good- Beautiful, bright and large 5.5"" screen. Great visibility in sunlight!- 2 stereo front facing speakers that sound better that any other phone I have heard before.- Near stock Android Lollipop.- 2910mAh battery. Great battery life. On a slow day the phone could last 3 days for me easy. On a busy day it will last the day and then some.- Small dimensions for a big phone. One of the thinnest phones I have ever seen. Very light as well.- Build quality looks excellent. Phone looks sleek and stylish.- Camera is great in optimal conditions. Low light it's poor. Might be fixable in an update.- 16GB storage. I consider anything 16GB or higher a positive.- Storage expandable to 128GB with a micro SD card. I popped one in for my music and it's great (I have over 75GB of music and growing.)- Call quality while not being super is average for a cell phone. If you use the speaker phone option it sounds great.- Phone can be completely used upside down, even on calls!- Reception is great for me. Where as on my Samsung Galaxy S2 Skyrocket I was always getting 1-2 bars. On the Idol 3 I get 3-5 bars. However, reception will very greatly for each person.- SIM unlocked and usable on both AT&T and T-Mobile, including 4G LTE.- Free earbuds. Their not great but their decent and get the job done.- Of course the price!BadBesides the phone not having a removable battery (which is usually a must for me), I personally i can't think of anything bad on this phone. There are a few small things but these should all be fixable on software updates down the road. Alcatel has already conformed they will keep this phone updated for the standard lifespan of a cell phone, usually 18 to 24 months.- Phone can lag a bit. Use the close apps button on the recent apps screen to keep the phone performing optimally. Keeping unused apps out of memory will greatly affect performance. The processor is not the latest and greatest but it does it's job, especially for battery life.- Camera in low light conditions.That's about it for me. I was wary about buying an Alcatel phone as I usually buy either Samsung, HTC or LG but this is a very nice and affordable phone. I highly recommend this phone.*** UPDATE ***Alcatel sent out a performance update less than 2 months after release. I know of only one other company that does faster updates so this is pretty good. I don't know all the things that were in the update but I can say is that it fixed the following issues: UI lag (the user interface no longer has lag when using it), Double Tap to Wake works perfectly now, some minor camera issues were fixed. cell signal dropping sometimes when using LTE was fixed. Also there were a few UI and camera tweaks added as well. Overall the update was great and makes the phone perfect."
"Alcatel",5,"Love the almost stock android, zippy, long battery life. I mean for 250, I got nothing to complain, basic phone with amazing build."
"Alcatel",4,"Ordered 3 of these for myself and family members. Definitely an upgrade from our previous phones. Light, thin, and fast enough for me. Price is right for something pretty close to flagship specs. It does intend to get a bit hot on the back so I just put a case on it. Previous reviews for the press kits pointed that out with the snapdragon 615, but other than that I have no regrets about picking up this phone.Update: August 2nd, 2015. One out of three phones that I ordered just crapped out. LOL. Guess I just had bad luck. Everything was working fine then all of a sudden just started rebooting in a loop. Even did a factory reset and same issue. Definitely a hardware issue. Oh wells. Calling the Manufacturer monday :/"
"Alcatel",5,"Faster than a Nexus 5. Great screen. Excellent battery life. Attractive (unbranded) front face. Overall I'm blown away by this device primarly because of it's price point. There's no reason to pay $600+ for a smartphone these days."
"Alcatel",3,"To preface this review: I am coming from a Nexus 4, which had served me well up till the most recent Android updates, which have been buggy and have killed the battery life on what was previously an almost perfect device.Now, onto the Idol 3: It's a gorgeous phone, with a big, bright & crisp screen and lovely design. The UI has been lightly skinned, which is a good thing as I'm a fan of stock Android. Benchmark scores aren't top notch, but they blow away the Nexus 4 and are just about on par with the Samsung S4. For the price, you're getting a lot of phone here.Yet, there are some significant areas for improvement: Shutter speed is quick but indoor photos are noisy. There's a bit of general UI lag, which isn't that obtrusive. These issues aren't monumental considering the price. More concerning: when browsing certain Flash-heavy sites using Chrome or the stock browse, such as ESPN or Boston.com, the browser lags/stutters to the point that it's essentially unusable. This is a serious issue as we obviously use our phones as portable web browsers a lot. To have a phone that can't navigate well through who knows how many different sites is a near deal-breaker. Other users on various web forums are experiencing the same thing, so it's not just me. Also note that I haven't overloaded the phone with a ton of random apps to muddy the waters.I've only had the phone for a day or two, so hopefully this is a launch issue, but if Alcatel can't push an fix within the next couple of weeks, this thing is going back.3-stars with the stuttering browser issue, otherwise, this is a 5-star phone."
"Alcatel",5,"Absolutely love this device. Once I heard Alcatel was selling a phone with such good specs at such a low price I jumped at the pre-order and I am so glad I did. Although the phone was delivered to my neighbor, and after some worried searching saw it on their porch, I have no problems since my order was upgraded to two day shipping.The device is very light weight and very thin. Its screen is beautiful and very bright. Full, rich color from all viewing angles. The speakers are much better than expected, very loud with solid lows and sharp highs. The headphones provided are of very good quality with phenomenal sound and deep bass. The rear camera is quite good for videos but sub par for stills. The quality in a low light setting is very dull and scratchy. The front camera is a different story. Very rich detail and contrast with a very noticable difference in a low light setting, the pictures are much clearer.The battery is very good. With an average day of usage mostly consisting of YouTube and Facebook I had almost 35% left at the end of the day.The snapdragon processor is a big plus in this device. It is very snappy and holds its own in demanding apps. There is a little lag only when clearing recent apps.The android 5.0 is excellent and very clean on this device.Although the phone is made out of plastic, I must say it has a very durable and quality feel to it. Since the back cannot be removed there is no creaking when force is applied.Overall I must say that this phone is worth every penny and I would highly reccomme d to anybody on a budget."
"Alcatel",2,"Update 7/15/15: Alcatel recently released an update for the phone. While it fixed the double tap to wake issue that previously worked inconsistently, it broke Google Voice interception of outbound calls. Therefore, this phone is nearly unusable to me as a phone, since my primary number is a Google Voice number. As a very inconvenient workaround, I now have to load the Google Voice webpage in order to make a call. I am now considering to replace this phone and do not recommend it to anyone who uses Google Voice to make outbound calls. If you already have this phone and use Google Voice, DO NOT INSTALL THE LATEST UPDATE!---------------------------------------Original review:The Idol 3 is an excellent phone for the $200 pre-order price. At the $250 regular price, I recommend weighing the pros and cons against two-year old flagship phones that sell for a similar price. I am looking forward to Alcatel addressing some of the ""cons"" listed below with a firmware update.Pros:- Beautiful, 5.5"" screen- Good battery life- Android Lollipop experience without the unnecessary clutter- Very good speakers for a cell phone- Micro SD card slotCons:- Double tap to wake feature is so unreliable that it may as well not exist- Minimum volume setting for notifications and ringtones is too loud- Screen sometimes does not go to sleep after set time period- Poorer performance in day-to-day use (non-intensive apps, web browsing, e-mail) than 2-year old flagship phones that now sell for the same price, such as an LG G2- Home screen should have the option of fitting 5 columns of icons instead of just 4- Poorer low-light camera performance than an LG G2 (too much noise)- Non-removable battery- High, hard-to-reach power button"
"Alcatel",3,"I am so far neutral on the onetouch. It has a decent screen, expandable memory and a fast enough processor. All of these would have me rating the phone highly for the price it is very nice. However my phone came with a non-functioning gesture keyboard. And if that was not bad enough I attempted to call Alcatel to try and resolve the issue. First I download Alcatel support app, it has a 800 number that is non-functional (strike 1). Then I tried to call a number listed in the manual, no one is there on weekends and holidays, (strike 2). And last but not least is the question who releases a phone so that it arrives on a holiday weekend and does not have support available in any fashion what so ever. (strike 3). While I did fix the keyboard issue by downloading a free keyboard app I would like to have the original equipment/software work properly. Searching on the web found others complaining about the same issue and no help on their website. Buy at your own risk."
"Alcatel",5,"What a steal at $250! This phone definitely holds its own against the 2015 Flagship phones.View some sample pictures from the rear camera. You can see daylight pictures are nice but low-light pictures are noisy.Pros:Price and valueGreat screenLoud speakersLooks very niceCons:Camera doesn't hold up in low light situationsNo wireless chargingOccasional lag due to mid end processorSlippery phoneFind my video review here: https://youtu.be/JU-dDjKi4Ig"
"Alcatel",4,"BUY A SCREEN PROTECTOR ASAP!!!!I consider myself a pretty careful person when it comes to my electronics. I underestimated myself this weekend and it dropped on the floor of a bus, I was shuffling my feet without knowing the phone was face down on the floor and boom.. scratched screen. Screen protector was already on order and being delivered the following monday :( Totally my fault obviously, but just wanted to warn you guys to definitely get a screen protector and do not chance it with this phone, because almost all the features on this phone are awesome for the price!Screen is beautiful and bright and clear, reminds me of my samsung note 2 AMOLED screen, very clear. keeping the costs down had to be taken somewhere and it is the non scratch resistant screen.Speed seems adequate. I havent really tested its full potential but this is going to be my second phone.sound is AMAZING, JBL speakers and it really shows, Even when plugging it into my car, the sound seems better than my previous phone.Camera app needs some work, or maybe just a different app would work. I was hoping it would take better macro pictures and focus fast on that type of scene but it doesn't for me.size is similar to my note 2, a little bit too big for my hand. But its pretty thin which makes up for that.The power button and volume buttons are high up so reaching them takes some hand maneuvering. you might not think of it much, but once you notice it..Battery life seems pretty good, you could probably get a good day and a half with normal/light usage. It seems like a stock version of android 5.0 lollipop with no bloatware which helps a lot with battery life as well.Overall I think for 200 this is a great deal. Just wish i didn't jump the gun and use it unprotected.Update #1:browsing around the Google app store, I found Open Camera, which is a great alternative to use,. It has a lot of features and macro mode which I was complaining about, and this phone seems to take great macro photos at about 5 inches away.Update #2: Camera app alternativeI had a chance to do some outdoor macro photos and I am VERY impressed with how it did! Using Open Camera and having it on macro mode setting, focusing was for the most part pretty quick and I added some photos to see.Update #3 - 11-5-16 Sold phone a long time ago..Sorry can't provide any further updates on this phone. Judging by the Amazon price for this phone, there are plenty of other phones I would rather get with equal or better specs."
"Alcatel",2,"I was really pleased when I unboxed this phone and set it up via wifi. At that point I would have given it 5 stars. Unfortunately that changed when I attempted to install the sim and micro sd card. When I inserted the tray into the phone it wasn't recognized and stuck out from the side of the phone just a tiny bit at a slight angle. When I went to remove it and try to reinsert, the tray broke when pulling it back out. I thought maybe I could just get another tray but when I turned the phone over some of the contacts fell out. I have no idea whether this is a design defect or I just got a defective phone but so much for the pre release discount."
"Alcatel",5,"Flagg ship killer"
"Alcatel",5,"Excellent phone. Great battery life. No problems whatsoever. Very pleased and highly satisfied"
"Alcatel",5,"I love this phone its the best I've had so far"
"Alcatel",3,"Nice phone but too many glitches"
"Alcatel",5,"I bought 2 of these phones. i love all the features in it. You'll never go wrong with this phone especially the LTE works for AT&T."
"Alcatel",4,"Great for the price."
"Alcatel",4,"I had a lot of issues on the phone that i got through Amazone [battery life, no network etc] and got it replaced, The replacement phone works fine and I donot face any issues. The battery life on my new phone is pretty good and the sound quality is pretty good and i get network coverage all the time.The only time i had an issue with the phone is initially when i tried to get it to connect to LTE and i had to manually do some changes to the APN settings. Apart from that ,the phone works great and its value for money..."
"Alcatel",5,"Many reviews seem to be based on high end phone users looking at a value phone, my review is a different angle, I kicked the contract phones my last iPhone was a 5s, went to att pre pay, and the worst phone I ever owned, forget what it was, then to att's best prepay phone I could find at the time, a galaxy express, and it was OK, but getting old, time for a upgrade, looked at all att prepay phones and what a joke, and learned about the whole unlocked phone thing. The idol 3 cost less than my old express did, is a major upgrade in every aspect, screen, speakers, memory, and processer you name it.What lag there is , is nothing like my old express, the idol 3 zips along just fine, a studder closing all apps is all I have found, my express would lock up. Even the camera is leaps over what I had.Do hope to see a 5.1 upgrade?Anyway for a value phone, the idol 3 is hard to beat. Recommenced."
"Alcatel",5,"Great phone. Still learning to use all the features. Works well with the Consumer Cellular phone plan."
"Alcatel",2,"But there are just a few too many issues that it's hard to ignore. Alcatel should absolutely take one more iteration on this phone and they will have something just about perfect.First let's talk about the pros:- Price - absolutely amazing value for the buck- Speedy - plenty fast enough for almost anyone needs, very fee stutters navigating around- camera is actually one of the best I've used outside of a very few phones- almost everything not listed as a con. Seriously this thing is very good overall.Now the cons, which are minor, but eventually they will become deal breakers:- Bluetooth audio is very very hollow sounding. Any media (music, podcasts, phone calls) sounds like you're listening to it over a tin can telephone. If you ever use Bluetooth you'll notice this almost immediately.- Power button in an un-intuitive location. Seriously guys it's standard on Android to have the volume and power button on the right side. Having volume on the right and power on the left is just a needless change. Just put it where everyone else does.- It may just be my device, but a week ago the combination SIM tray and SD card tray (in an of itself a real pain to load and unload) just seemed to stop working. My photos stopped backing up and calls wouldn't go through. I'd get a replacement but with the other issues I'll just get a refund.Again I really like the idea Alcatel was going for and they should definitely just fix these few issues and will have a great flagship-level phone."
"Alcatel",3,"It's a good phone but if you use it to browse the web a lot it's lack of memory hurts the experience... Scrolling webpages become a unpleasant experience... Hopefully the next version will have more memory wich would fix this issue."
"Alcatel",5,"Good price. fast shipping."
"Alcatel",5,"I adquiro this cell at a good price, and I only have a few days with him, so far I 'm surprised with all epesifiaciones and options , general .. rapidez..Todo cell is adata you. It is good team and if cuidas- best that price .."
"Alcatel",1,"Display very easy to crack, once cracked, (just a tiny crack) will become totally touch unresponsive, unlike other phones .won't buy an alcatel again"
"Alcatel",5,"My first smart phone. It will take me a while to use all its capacity. I just heard about an app that is a magnifier, which I really need. Asking ""Okay Google"" has replaced Wikipedia as my new helpmate. Great price too."
"Alcatel",5,"Honestly will never buy a NAME brand phone again. My wife and I go through phones. You know the $600+ ones about every 6 months. This phone is faster than my LG G4, my Galaxy s6, and her Galaxy Note 4. Just plain and simple phone that does everything well."
"Alcatel",5,"Bought this phone for my mother as her work phone. Very pleased with the built, though plastic and light. The Screen is bright and the os is basically a google skin. Great sounds and smooth in operating. I wouldn't recommend if you like to load your phone with apps and games. If You are basic with a few chat apps and fb, this is more than enough ram. Lastly very attractive, even next to my Samsung note 5 it looks every bit the cost. Kudos."
"Alcatel",5,"I love this phone!! I wanted a phone that was not too expensive, was large, and was Android 5. I did extensive research and was led to this phone. I was not familiar with the brand, but it has proved to be a wise choice. This is my first cell phone and I am happy to not have to use my teens phone.The value for the price is exceptional. If you are on the fence, don't be. This is the one"
"Alcatel",3,"Everything positive that has been said about this phone is true. But the face chat is not that great. I didn't have any complaints until I called my friend and we chatted over the video phone camera. And I don't know why but when I go to google images, the pixels on the images are pretty bad. I've never had issues with that on any phone, and I've had the Alcatel fierce 2. So I gave it 3 stars for that reason."
"Alcatel",5,"Great budget phone, nice screen, pretty quick and very little bloatware, most of what is there can be uninstalled."
"Alcatel",2,"To start off the is a decent phone for its generation, clear screen and feels good in hand nice weight.Unfortunately the sim card stop registering and google play didn't open. Phone work for about a week.The sim card was fine we placed it into a different phone worked properly. In all its old and slow but looks and feels nice."
"Alcatel",5,"Great display and sound, beautiful look"
"Alcatel",5,"This phone is great! I hadn't had any real problems out of it except for when it did not wake up at one time. I tapped, I pressed the power button and I even called it, mind you this was after the most recent update. I ended up having to do a hard reset on it, so far no further problems. The only thing that I don't like is that you don't have access to emojis on social media but other than its a very good phone definitely worth $250 bucks.UPDATE!!!!!!!Well I have had this phone for a while now and I loved it, the only problems Ive had with this phone are ones that Ive caused myself, as far as the phone messing up on its own, no problems. The worst thing about this phone is the screen is not durable at all, one tap against a chair and it cracks and the screen does not work, cant unlock it, cant do anything, my galaxy s3 is way more durable than this. I recommend getting a tempered glass protector for it and the most durable case you can, but generally as long as you have the tempered glass you can just about use any case you would like. Ive searched all over for a phone that might compare to this, tired of Samsung products and their UI and notification sounds, to poor for anything else that I might genuinely like, ran across the HONOR 5X but it doesnt have a reversible interface and it hasnt been released yet, I'm not patient enough to wait a couple months for reviews so I figure I will just order this again, Win WIn."
"Alcatel",5,"love it."
"Alcatel",4,"Great performance, never run into any lagging. Nice and thin and fits well in my pocket (I was used to a 4"" phone!). Great screen and battery life. Dropped one star because the camera isn't all that great, particularly in low light."
"Alcatel",5,"I have been using this phone for two months now. My previous phone was an HTC One M7 Google Play Edition. And I have to say, I am pleasantly surprised. The phone is blazingly fast, the screen is absolutely awesome, you can see it clearly in full midday sunlight, it is BRIGHT!! The battery life on this thing is awesome, a very good camera, very loud and decent sounding speakers, a very close to vanilla android, and last but not least, TIMELY ANDROID UPDATES!! For me it was the choice between an LG G4 or this one, and I am glad I bought this one and saved a lot of money too."
"Alcatel",4,"The idol 3 met all my expectations from reading all the reviews posted. If ur on the fence about purchasing this unit I suggest you pull the trigger."
"Alcatel",5,"This really is an amazing phone! I made the shift from an iPhone 4s 3 mos. ago and have enjoyed the learning curve from iOS to android with the Idol 3. It's kept up with day to day processes and battery life has been great. Its a bit oversensitive at times, meaning it'll activate apps on its own, but not a dealbreaker. I've gotten a lot of compliments on the looks of this idol3 and for the price I'm very happy! By the way, it takes decent pics too!"
"Alcatel",2,"I was loving this phone - the beautiful display! the amped front-facing speakers! the near-stock android lollipop experience running very smoothly! Then, it happened. I don't know how it happened which is the hardest part because I woke up last Sunday morning to a broken digitizer. I pulled the phone out of the lower pocket of my cargo shorts that it had resided in several times since purchase and there it was - that inch-long crack across the top right corner of the screen. Along with it came the disabled lower half of the screen to any input.I ordered a digitizer on ebay for $25 despite the lack of online tutorials for replacing anything on this new-ish phone. Please note - it is not very difficult to get into, but you will find it nearly impossible to reassemble this phone without having rendered it completely useless during disassembly!The design (speakers near the edges) doesn't lend itself to any sort of meaningful case usage.So, here I am back to using my nearly 3 year old Samsung Galaxy S4 :(I tried, Alcatel."
"Alcatel",2,"Loved everything about the phone except the camera which totally sucked if you didn't have the perfect lighting situation. If having a good camera isn't important to you then it's a good phone."
"Alcatel",5,"I absolutely LOVE this phone. I switched from a Galaxy S6 Edge because the Edge was constantly lagging and stuttering. I couldnt believe how terrible it was--a $750 phone!!! So, I did my due diligence and researched sub $300 phones that I could replace it with. I came across the one touch 3 and the ASUS Zenfone. I decided to go with the One Touch because although it has less processor capacity and ram than the Zenfone it made up for it in battery longevity, screen quality, and front facing speakers.The reviews were so right. The screen is beautiful. The front facing speakers sound just as good as on the HTC One M9. I have not experienced ANY of the lag I experienced on the S6 Edge (probably because there is little to no bloatware running in the background.)The battery also provides about 1.5 hours more screen on time than the S6.Get this phone. You wont be disappointed. I promise."
"Alcatel",5,"A great phone for the money. If you don't have to have the latest and greatest then check this phone out. Only missing 3gb(it has 2) ram as compared to other top flight phones."
"Alcatel",5,"So far, a great phone. I did a lot of research when deciding on a new phone in this price range. I listen to a lot of music on the run and the tipping point in favor of the Idol 3, for me, was the front facing stereo speakers.I've had the phone for a few days now, and I'm very impressed with it. The user interface is pretty much stock Lollipop, which I really appreciate. There is very little bloatware/shovelware taking up memory and what there is can be easily removed. The camera is average and takes decent pictures under the right conditions. Bluetooth paired up with all my devices, even the more finicky devices that have given me fits in the past. Call quality is really good and the voices are clear on both ends. Signal reception has been the same as my old phone and I have had no issues connecting to the network. WIFI connections are as expected and I have had no issues.I dropped in a 128Gb micro SD card and it is working as expected. I haven't had a chance to test out the NFC connection, but It's nice to have this capability.The real shocker is the sound quality. The front facing stereo speakers are really impressive. They are loud and you can crank it up with no distortion. Everyone I've demo'ed this for has had the same reaction, ""Whoa, that is impressive"". Are you going to replace your home sound system? Of course not, But you get some pretty big sound from some pretty small speakers. The other surprise was from the included ear buds. I wasn't expecting much, but they sound pretty good for being included in the box. They have flat, no tangle cables and include different size ear pieces. They are a little flat sounding in the mid range, but not objectionably so. They won't replace my more expensive ear buds, but if these were the only ones I had, I'm not sure I would be that quick to replace them. I definitely won't be throwing these out.All in all I am very happy with this phone. It has great features and the sounds is incredible. On top of all that it functions well as a phone. In my opinion, this is a good value for the money."
"Alcatel",3,"I""m giving this phone a 3 because there seems to be (for me) a fundamental flaw in the ergonomics of the phone. The way the switches are set up they are never in the right place. Also, I seem to be constantly grabbing the phone and hitting the switches at the same time, which seems to try and shut the phone down, or take a screenshot of the phone, neither of which I like. It took me a while to figure out that when I was trying to shoot a photo I was gripping the phone in a manner that I hit the buttons and it kept shutting down.I've had similar android phones and never had this issue.The icons are cartoon-y (I put an icon pack in to create shortcuts so I didn't have to look at them) and the phone seems rather slow to respond (for example, when you change screens or shut down the open apps). The phone seems to work ok, when I'm not having trouble manipulating it, and the setup was relatively simple and straightforward (coming from another unlocked android).I would not buy the phone again, but will keep it for now as I don't want the hassle of getting another phone. My old one stopped working so this purchase, while researched, was made a bit more quickly than I might of liked."
"Alcatel",5,"I'm very pleased with the product, It met my expectations."
"Alcatel",5,"Absolutely love it. Exceeded my expectations for a phone in this price range. Display is great as well as best sound I've heard on any phone."
"Alcatel",5,"best budget 5.5 screen android phone why buy samsung or apple for three times the price. great camera and responsive quick phone"
"Alcatel",5,"This device works with mexican phone carriers, i bought this and the speakers sounds very loud does not need any from an iphone, samsung any other brands"
"Alcatel",4,"I like it,but the speakers are no that great and the pictures are ok."
"Alcatel",5,"Very good, smooth and solid phone. I really liked it."
"Alcatel",1,"Incredibly poor build quality, in my limited experience. The first phone I received had a failed LCD panel when I took it out of the box (box and packaging had no visible damage). The second one's LCD panel is seperating from the phone's casing and I've been very gentle with it for the few months I've had it. Given this 0/2 track record so far as the two I've received, I can't recommend this phone, especially since purchasing the international version (this version) via Amazon means you won't have a manufacturer warranty for any defects or repairs.The phone also performs more poorly than the Moto G 3rd Gen (same price range, but better build quality) on the original firmware, the newest official firmware, and several of the third party firmwares I've tried (CM, BlissPop, RR, and others)."
"Alcatel",2,"Droped it once doesn't work any more. Durability very low.. nice phone though"
"Alcatel",4,"Premium phone for the price of a baisc phone. Love it!!!"
"Alcatel",4,"Its an excellent phone. much better than I expected. Great screen.Good baytery life.Audio quality through headphones and speakers are good. My only problem is with the sensitivity of the screen"
"Alcatel",5,"- It has a good design, is very light, thin and symmetrical, which also used to use one of its most striking features, reversibility: does not matter as lame, the screen rotates for use in the right direction, even to take calls . That also has duplicates"
"Alcatel",4,"ok"
"Alcatel",3,"It's not the best but it's pretty good for the price"
"Alcatel",5,"The product is great. Its a great value for your money! The 1080p screen is gorgeous and the phone is surprisingly light. I had to get the case on it just to make it a bit heavy to feel something in hand. The resolution is on par with iPhone 6/7Plus edition.Its amazing how affordable this phone is with the kind of features that are packed. Not to mention, having not to figure out how to hold the phone when the phone rings and ability to accept the phone both ways is amazing!Surprisingly its the closest stock andriod experience that I ever had. No bloatware at all. The speakers are amazing and includes the JBL headset which is top notch. At this price point, this is close to a steal."
"Alcatel",5,"I've been very pleasantly surprised by this phone. My last phone was a Samsung Galaxy S3 and so far this just blows that out of the water. Great, front-facing speakers (for a phone, at least), solid connectivity and web browsing experience, nice sleak design, impressive battery life. It has everything I need in a phone for the right price."
"Alcatel",4,"Great cell. I buy with 99.99 offer, great deal."
"Alcatel",4,"Great build quality, minimal bloat ware, great sounding speakers, pretty ok call quality, looks good. I'm really a Windows Phone guy but thought I'd try Android for fun. Not to bad. I have however loaded it up with WP features and launchers. Got for $99.99 lucky me well worth it."
"Alcatel",5,"Amazing phone for the price. If you're looking for a good Android device and don't want to throw down a chunk, this is well worth it."
"Alcatel",5,"i have had this phone for 2 months now and I do not regret buying it. It is super amazing."
"Alcatel",4,"Haven't gotten around to thinking about dislikes yet"
"Alcatel",5,"Great phone, really loved the quality of the build. feels a quality product very good value for Money."
"Alcatel",4,"Just recieved the Idol 3 phone by Alcatel. I was a little sceptical about reading a lot of negative reviews about the camera on this phone, but I also own the Alcatel Pop One Touch, which takes very nice pictures usually without even using the flash! So, the first I did was to compare my old phone camera with the new one. I took the same pictures side by side, and this is what I found. Out of the box the new cameras exposure settings needed to be adjusted. If you click on the upper left of the camera screen, (there are three short lines), then choose settings--you will see exposure settings, click on the number 1 setting-- (Not -1). This will lighten up the screen for better picture taking. Under normal circumstances, you will not need a flash even inside your home! This will greatly improve your all around camera quality!! Hope it helps!! Great phone!"
"Alcatel",5,"This phone is amazing . I have a galaxy s4 purchased new when it came out 5 years ago . This phone is right there with it except its bigger and 10 times brighter and vibrant compared to my s4 phone. When My s4 finally dies out this will be waiting to replace it .the only thing they need to mark is where the sim card removal tool is it took me 20 minitues trying to find it"
"Alcatel",4,"Super phone. Poor battery."
"Alcatel",5,"This is a great phone for those of us who want a VERY nice, large screen, excellent battery life and don't need the fastest phone on the market. Yeah, it's slower than the Sammie S6 I got from work, but it isn't a long, painful wait for it to complete a task, just a slight hesitation. Unless you are a serious power user I doubt you'll have a problem with performance. The battery life is better than the S6. And it works as well as the Samsung as an actual phone (yes, I actually make calls on my phone... I'm old).The rear camera is fine... far better than my photography, that's for sure. I don't do selfies, so I don't know how well the front camera works (as indicated above, I'm old).The sound is MUCH better than the Samsung, both from the speaker and headphones, and the music program is easy to use and plays FLAC files.It is light enough that even with an armored case it isn't too heavy, and I quickly got used to the size. It is easier to carry on my belt, but it fits in my pocket. The S6 seems too small to me now, and I will almost certainly get another 5.5"" phone next time..I would have no hesitation buying another Alcatel phone when this one is ready to retire in another year or two. Or maybe three if it keeps working, since it certainly is meeting my phone, e-mail, snapshot and web surfing needs very well."
"Alcatel",3,"Decent phone, shame it died one day after the one year warranty ended. It was while I was playing kingdom hearts unchained x. Symptoms were: phone got hot, touch screen became unresponsive on and off, the next day blue screen, rebooted, another blue screen, then phone completely died.Dual front facing speakers that get nice and loud so that's a huge plus, mine came with jbl earbuds which is awesome considering how most phones don't even include them anymore. But, the placement of the auxiliary port is located at the top of the phone and this is weird because the mini usb port is located on the bottom. If you used one of those magnetic air vent phone holders for you car, things will get messy as there's no clear orientation to have good cable management when you want to plug the auxiliary cable to your phone while charging. However, the reversible design is nice so that you can make the auxiliary cable be located on the bottom relatively by putting the phone upside down.Coming from a samsung galaxy s3, the idol 3's screen is much more vibrant. Also the phone is about 7mm thin which is just 1mm thicker than the thinnest phone out there. Also you should plan on getting a case for the phone, the back of this phone is really slippery with zero grip which is awful for such a thin phone. So if you get sweaty hands due to the heat emitted from this phone, the chance of it falling is quite high. Another plus was that alcatel did provide a software update to Android Marshmallow, which no one thought they would do considering the idol 4 was coming out, the idol 3 was made by a chinese company which don't really provide software support, and that the idol 3 was a budget phone. The stock os doesn't really come with a lot of bloat, although surprisingly, the clock app that comes with the phone is actually made by avg, the same guys that make the antivirus, which no one would have found out until one day play store decided to update the clock app. The updated clock app was terrible because it went away from the google's material design to some awkward interface. The average rating was around 2 stars before avg reverted back to the original clock app. The biggest con I would have to mention is the very slow flash storage, this is really noticeable when you load files or install apps in the play store.Oh well, time to get a new phone and this is just a lesson to always back up your texts and photos as well as get an extended warranty if you plan on using the phone for a very long time. Especially on devices like these where there is no removable back cover. I set the expected usage to a year anyways when I bought the phone considering it was only 250 when I bought it. The phone did get cheaper, but that's to be expected as time goes on.-----update 9/13/16---------Wow, so they still honored the warranty when my phone died. Fantastic service; they went above and beyond. They shipped the phone back with 2 day ups air too."
"Alcatel",1,"I received a paper stapler . not buy cell.The order gives me the option to open a claim as I do please ."
"Alcatel",5,"I have had the phone for a week now and here is my honest opinion. As you see, that I have given the phone 5 stars. This rating is for comparison to other phones in it's price range. I am not going to try and compare this phone with IPhone or Samsung. I have T-Mobile and I am on a no-contract employee plan that requires me to buy my phones outright. So price is a BIG deal. IMO the phone is great! Here are my honest thoughts:- Screen Size and looks is great! Very readable in the sun. Well above it's $250 price tag- The ONLY lag I ever experience is when I am sweeping running apps. And that is hardly a lag. It is very fluid and responsive.- No Dropped Calls- My LTE T-Mobile data has been 12.5 mbps- Front facings speakers are amazing and sound great. BUT they are louder than I want them to be at the lowest setting. I have Triplets Babies and when they are asleep, I can't have headphones in and the audio on the lowest setting is still too loud.- The Camera is Great! No issues or complaints.- The double tap to turn it on is unreliable and works less than 50% of the time. Double tapping to turn off works just fine.- BUT I am right handed and I have no issues with where the on/off button is. I don't know why others have complained.- I love the I can talk into either end of the phone. Especially when using the google search. It hears me every time!- The GPS is great and on-time! The front facing speakers were great to hear the turn by turn directions.- The head phones sound great!- The reversible setting is awesome and such a duh idea.- This may be an Android problem but is really annoying… but any group messaging that I have gets a date of Jan 17, 1970 and so they just sit at the bottom of my messages log. It’s VERY Annoying and I can’t figure out how to fix that. Anyone else have this problem?- Battery Life is about a day in a half. I use my phone mostly with Calls, Texts, Twitter, Facebook, Email, Camera, Internet. (Occasionally the GPS and Netflix, no gaming.)- In all, the phone is not ""perfect"". But just as close as it's going to be at this price. Definitely worth 5 stars and I recommend it every time!Now I just need a case. Not a bulky one. Any recommendations?"
"Alcatel",5,"At this price I think that Idole 3 can be considered one of the best smartphones on the market.It is a good device and very easy to handle.PRO: LTE frequencies working with AT&T and other US carriers, Android Lollipop, excellent and brilliant screen, very good cameras (front camera is 8 mp!), excellent stereo speakers, good battery.CON: processor MSM8939 is not fast: avoid multitasking! audio during calls could have a little more clarity."
"Alcatel",5,"Fantastic screen, good performance, good battery life. Overall: A+"
"Alcatel",4,"yes but I wish it was a 2k or 4k screen and the speakers was a little louder but other than that I love the phone for the price $249can't beat that or less it was $199but is OK"
"Alcatel",4,"Headphones are missing"
"Alcatel",5,"Very practical phone: large screen, lightweight, and high sound quality."
"Alcatel",5,"Far better than my Galaxy s4 or note 2, much better battery and faster than eitherI have a lot of apps, and it is not laggy at all, but I use Nova launcher which is greatThe only negative is that the double tap function often does not work. I don't know if this is a phone issue or Android or Novalauncher."
"Alcatel",4,"I'm a phone guy and used almost every phone out there. This device is great for the normal consumer who is looking for something nice and gets the job done! The camera is good not great but good. Gets the job done to leave a good memory of something you want to snap a quick photo of. The battery is pretty decent. previous device was a Oneplus one so I got spoiled with great battery life. For being a $250 device this is a great deal and great value!"
"Alcatel",5,"Phone came and I was quite surprised at how light it was and big compared to my nokia 925. The front facing speakers sounds great and the reversible screen is plain ol' genius, makes perfect sense. No more fumbling for your Phone, it has a lag to it when your performing some task (mainly task manager), but its ok. Good battery life (for the screen size), I get a whole day out of a charge. I really love the phone, especially because I've always bought unlocked phones but this one does it all at a fraction of the cost!!!! Highly recommended. Get tons of compliments on the look and sound quality......Sad to say I took the case off the phone to swap out my sd card and dropped the phone and wouldn't you know it, the screen cracked in the upper right corner. now the touch is inconsistent making the phone useless. Lets see how good Alcatels customer service is, wish me luck. Will update with outcome"
"Alcatel",5,"I've had this phone for a week and must say it lives up to the hype. A great midrange phone for budget price. $250 is a steal and I envy you who got the $199 deal.If you know this phone exists then you've most likely already seen reviews, you already know the good. You're here because you want to know what's bad right?ConsButton Placement - Its like this phone is made for lefties, I don't know what Alcatel was thinking when they inserted the power button WAYYY to the top left. You'll try to substitute with double tap to wake but it only works .75 of the time and you'll find it better to simply click the power button. The up/down volume buttons is something it will take a LONG TIME getting use to. I'm so used to the volume buttons being on the mid-left instead of top right... What were they thinking!? LolConnection - When I first got the phone it seemed to drop connection a bit, I'd say 1/5 calls. I was kinda pissed at first BUT the past 3 days it hasn't dropped any and I make lots of phone calls since I'm a supervisor and have a lot of unreliable employees. Also I live in Miami not like in the middle of no where so I have good reception.Camera - If you're coming from a high end device this rear facing camera won't impress you. Coming from a 8MP Galaxy S3 I'd say this camera JUST gets the job done. This camera is pretty bad at catching light if you take a picture at 12PM it looks like it was taken 6PM. Take it at 7PM it looks like it was taken 11PM. If you post 10 pictures on IG & FB everyday you'll probably want to aim for something with a better camera.Not trying to poop on the camera because like I said it gets the job done.In contrast the 8MP front facing camera is great. One of the few phones on the market with something above a 5MP front facing camera.Those are the only small negatives I can think of BUT its not really deal breaking which is why I still gave it 5 stars. If you're on the fence just click purchase you won't regret it. If so simply return it within 30 days. 😄"
"Alcatel",5,"Excellent phone, poor documentation."
"Alcatel",5,"Awesome phone. Had to return it due to signal issues. I will probably buy it again after some updates get released."
"Alcatel",5,"After about a week of use, I have very little to complain about with this phone. The very bright and sharp display is easy to read in sunlight, the sound is as clear and loud as I've ever seen in a smartphone. Was worried that the 5.5"" screen would feel too big in my hand, but it actually fits well in my hand. The power button placement is a little high on the left side, but I've already gotten used to it. 4G LTE reception with Cricket Wireless has been solid, and I get a full day of battery life, even with a few hours of screen time. The phone feels thin and light but still feels solid. I'm still mastering the camera, finding that tapping the subject of your photo before taking does a great job of setting the proper exposure, especially in shots where there's something brighter than your subject elsewhere in the photo."
"Alcatel",4,"Amazing value. Great phone. Great reception. Excellent display. Good speakers. Updates are a bit flaky. First one messed up texting functionality and the third threw my phone into an endless reboot cycle. I ended up booting in safe mode, and eventually got the phone to boot again without having to wipe it. Sharing videos over email is still broken, which is very annoying. Maybe the next update will fix it. Only downside of this device is that it doesn't ship with stock Android, although it's pretty close (very few software enhancements and no bloatware)."
"Alcatel",4,"So I decided to spend less on a phone after I broke last phone. I gave this phone a shot because I liked the aesthetics of it and reviews said it had a great screen and sound. So far I love everything about the phone except for the processor, if I could upgrade it to a snapdragon 800 series this phone would be perfect. The phone is a little laggy at times, but for the price that is to be expected a little bit. The screen and sound are awesome, camera is good enough for me, and it has a sd card slot. Overall I'm quite impressed especially since I got it on sale. Minus one star for the processor."
"Alcatel",5,"The phone is great, love it!"
"Alcatel",5,"Been using the Idol 3 as my daily driver over the past week and so far I'm very impressed. The Idol 3 has a bright high resolution screen, loud front facing speakers, good battery life, solid build quality and runs near stock Android. Also comes with JBL earbuds. I'd definitely recommend this phone to anyone looking for an unlocked smartphone for less than $300."
"Alcatel",4,"Very nice speakers, good for music and movie. Slow cpu wish come with 3 gb of memory"
"Alcatel",5,"I've had a N5 since launch. The N5 was a great phone for me other than the horrendous battery life. Fast forward to the present and I wanted even more screen real estate. I knew I wanted at least 5.5"", maybe even 6"". I just couldn't justify spending north of $400+ for a N6, G4, S6, etc though. When the Idol went for sale for $180 on Amazon Prime Day I had to take the chance even though this phone was completely off my radar. The Idol 3 makes the Nexus 5 feel/look like old newsIdol 3 as compared to the Nexus 5:**Screen**The screen is just as good as the N5, I'd say even better as there isn't horrendous white light bleed along the edge at extreme viewing angels. The extra half inch really makes a difference in media consumption.**Battery**Oh wow! It's nice to have a battery again!I had a QI wireless charger for my N5 at work. Probably a good thing too or I would have sold my N5 a long time ago as we all know the battery blows on the N5. While I'd prefer that the Idol had wireless charging ability, I can live without it as I can easily get 2 days of use. It's so odd looking at the battery percentage and not see it drop like a rock during the day. I need to look into aftermarket wireless micro usb charger + case to conceal it. Hopefully I can find the thinnest most ""stock"" looking combo.**Speakers**The speakers? OMFGBBQ!!! I sometimes listened to the N5 streaming music on it's lone speaker when working on projects. It provided fill and it passed the time. The Idol's speakers are exponentially better. Heck I don't even think I've had them over 3/4 volume. I don't think I can buy another phone that DOESN'T have two forward facing speakers now. I'm spoiled now.**Performance**Feels on par with my N5. Yeah I see a stutter here and there when loading a page or what not but it's in no way a deal breaker for me.**Reception**I'm on TMO's $30 5gb prepaid plan and I get crap for cellular reception in my house. Luckily I get LTE @ my work. So I've completely converted to Google Hangouts VOIP. I use wifi @ home for calls, LTE data while I'm away from the house. After a week things have been great so far for my coverage and use.**Feel**Lighter, thinner than the N5. Only con is the Idol is a slippery sob! I really have to mind my Ps and Qs when handling it. I like my phones to be naked as I don't like the bulk. However I think I'll have to just bite the bullet and get a case for this, not only for the wireless charging listed above, but for grip as well as protection cause yeah I don't think the Idol is gonna take well to abuse :(**Conclusion**Well I was able to sell my N5 for $180 on CL in a day. Since I basically stole the Idol for $180 from that Amazon sale I got a GREAT upgrade for free :) I'm a happy camper.Now that the boot-loader is unlocked on the Idol I'm anxiously awaiting how performance will increase with a custom rom. Good times."
"Alcatel",5,"Ok was very disappointed when I got y phone and turned it on it asked me to do an update I did and I couldn't do anything with it after all I had was a black screen so I had to do a hard reset and NOT DO THE UPDATE...now I'm very happy with my phone for now ....I just got it yesterday.update I LOVE THIS PHONE"
"Alcatel",5,"This phone is great for the price. Has all of the state of the art features that other high grade smart phones have. Love the slim design. Better that buying a phone through ATT Next and being stuck for $15 -25/month for 30 months."
"Alcatel",5,"It is a great phone that exceeded my expectations. The stock camera app cannot lock the focus under indoor lighting. But I solved the problem by downloading a free app ""A Better Camera"". An added bonus, I now have descent cellular signal that my previous 3 phones couldn't get in my office. Very satisfied so far."
"Alcatel",5,"Has been an amazing device for the price. Perfect for anyone who wants a quality experience on a budget."
"Alcatel",4,"A 4! Because of the sim tray, don't like the back to back design, cards did and could get stuck, got to be very careful!! outside of that this device rocks! Thanks"
"Alcatel",5,"Beautiful, works great just advertised. Only problem was getting it set up by consumer cellular. It took four agents to finally get it right. Two agents and a supervisor told me it wouldn't work with their system. I'm so glad I persisted until I got a customer service rep that knew what to do. Great battery life. Since it is new I'll have to wait and seehow it works long term."
"Alcatel",2,"Sent back very laggy when using chrome"
"Alcatel",4,"excellent good phone all I would like to work more in the chamber for dark shots"
"Alcatel",1,"Pros:Speakers are loudest I've heardDisplay is bright and vividThe speed is pretty fast once you remove the minimal bloat, especially the antivirusVery lightweightBattery life was decentCons:Bad LTE receptionCamera wasn't very good, the flash is way too weak so low light is abysmalTap 2 wake is spotty, sometimes because it's slow to wake up. I'd rather just disable itUgly branding on the back. Sticker would solve thisNot many cases out thereOverall:I returned this thing. A phone that loses signal (0 bars!) between towers on the 405 freeway in LA? I'm not T-Mobile, and my cheap old LG F6 was a beast compared to this. My new LG G4 picks it up fine, too. I gave the Idol 3 a chance. Did Alcatel not even test this one bit in the field? What good is band 12 if I have trouble with band 4?!?!"
"Alcatel",4,"I'll admit it, I've got a phone problem. I tire of phones quickly and also get irritated by them. I've used nearly every flagship device on the market. This device keeps pace with any flagship that's a generation old and blows away mid range device it's designed to compete with.The camera is good, voice calls are good, display is excellent even in direct light, and it's responsive even when multi tasking.You may not like the fixed battery or the almost stock Android. Samsung, HTC, and LG all have ""skins"" that make for a nicer user experience.I will update my review with real battery life numbers. 2 days in the battery seems like plenty to get you through a day.Before you fork over $30 per month for the next 2 years, or worse yet sign a contract, give this phone a shot."
"Alcatel",4,"Great smart phone. Gets a bit sluggish from time to time, but I still like it. It's big, thin and the battery last all day. A bang for the buck!"
"Alcatel",5,"I Like it alot. Good loud speakers and great looking screen, quick and snappy on apps. It does have some bloatware but can get it out easily enough. I just wished this model had an otterbox defender or something as strong."
"Alcatel",1,"This phone is great (for the price I paid) when it worked. After a few month, the screen on mine cracked and rendered the phone unresponsive to touch; therefore, useless. I had a silicone case and temper glass protective screen on since the first day. Never drop the phone or abuse it in anyway, the screen just cracked for no reason while the phone was in my pocket by itself. Unfortunately, physical damage is not covered under warranty. Be warned!"
"Alcatel",5,"Came in two days. We ordered it for our younger cousin. So far so good. We may update once she gets it turned on and going. But you shouldn't get much complaint from a 16 yr old. lol"
"Alcatel",3,"Average phone with very buggy performance"
"Alcatel",1,"I just got a replacement of this device and it auto restarts like crazy......I wish I didn't have to have this phone anymore"
"Alcatel",1,"It only gets 1 star bc it kept shutting itself off. It would freeze then shut off in the middle of me doing something. Or I could b across the RM and my phone would shut off. Not sure if I just got a bad one or not but I couldn't have my phone shutting off every few seconds."
"Alcatel",5,"This is a phone that I have thoroughly enjoyed. I have been a buyer of Alcatel phone for the last few years and have been happy with their product. However, this phone is one of their best. The only problem I've had seen doing a software update is when the ringer turns itself down to soft which makes hearing a call coming in very difficult to receive. I'm not saying this is normal, but, it has happened with the phone I just received. Amazon has been amazing in the fact that they are replacing my phone due to the circumstances.It is worth its cost and more. You can't go wrong with buying this phone."
"Alcatel",5,"Incredible phone and the best for its price. It does everything your average smartphone user wants and does it well. Clean stock android, great screen, and the best speakers I've heard on a smartphone. (Seriously these things are loud). I couldn't see anyone being disappointed with recieving this phone."
"Alcatel",2,"I bought this phone because it was capable of supporting 700mhz band 12 LTE which has better building penetration. Unfortunately, Alcatel was unable to design the phone to support VoLTE, and realized it only after marketing the phone to be compliant. The entire band 12 must be disabled to prevent a situation where the user would be unable to reach emergency services. The phone has lost a lot of value in my eye as a result. If I had known that band 12 would it be supported, I would have purchased a different phone."
"Alcatel",2,"Very glitchy and not very easy to use. The screen and sound are great though."
"Alcatel",1,"My screen keeps poppin up it's broke or something. Would buy a different phone"
"Alcatel",5,"works great"
"Alcatel",5,"Heavenly!"
"Alcatel",5,"good."
"Alcatel",5,"I love this phone with a clear screen and good sound. It doesn't come stuffed with apps I don't use. I like that it takes a storage card. I can get through a day with it before needing to charge its battery most days. When I was traveling, and constantly using it for navigating, taking pictures, getting information about where I was and what I was seeing, I did need to plug it into an external battery pack by late afternoon. This phone does everything much more expensive phones do if you don't want or need VR. I hope Alcatel will continue to make elegant, simple phones like the Idol3."
"Alcatel",5,"I like this cell phone !"
"Alcatel",5,"Awesome phone for a hundred bucks. Could not beat it."
"Alcatel",5,"Very worth for the price"
"Alcatel",5,"Works great, easy upgrade to Marshmallow. Well built. Don't wait! This is last years flagship and won't be around long. No problems with TMobile."
"Alcatel",1,"After only three weeks the phone screen has cracked in my pocket, rendering the touch screen inoperable. The phone's screen is so weak it could not survive a brisk jaunt around the city. On top of this, when I tried to repurchase a replacement phone, my order was cancelled by Alcatel but my funds were still removed from my account. I had to go through this TWICE and I had to hassle both my bank and Alcatel customer service to get my money back. The Alcatel customer service reps. were less than helpful and borderline apathetic to the matters.Based on my experiences it seems like Alcatel is an unscrupulous company peddling threadbare phones and has a piss-poor customer service infrastructure to hand their shoddy craftsmanship.Avoid Alcatel at all costs"
"Alcatel",5,"This is the cheapest phone I've ever bought and one of the best I've ever had. Having used it constantly everyday for almost a month now I knew I had to review it.Let's start with the physical: The phone is thin with a sleek design comparable to some flagships out there. It is ultra lightweight to the point that I don't feel it in my purse; sometimes I actually rummage through my bag to make sure it's still there. The screen is big and pictures are clear and crisp. Same sound-wise, I haven't had any dropped calls or had people on the other end telling me they can't hear me so it's definitely a jump up from my last android which was more than double the price.Now the technical: To start with I purchased a 32gb SDHC card to take advantage of the expandable storage so I didn't have to skimp out on any apps I used, and as a long time T-Mobile customer I was able to get the SIM card for free. I immediately put the cards in and voila I had a working phone. [Disclaimer: There are no features from T-Mobile that I do not have access to, unless there are features out there that I am not aware of].So the important stuff, I am in love with the eye scanner (HOW COOL IS THAT) which can be used as a lock screen mechanism. It makes me feel like a secret spy agent! Unlike fingerprint readers which seem outdated now, I'm able to impress my friends and family with an eye scanner. I also very much enjoy the camera which pulls up with two presses of the power button, it beats tapping on a screen that isn't always responsive in a moment's notice. I can capture vital images quickly and accurately in a moving vehicle or when I'm at a concert, which is simply awesome especially for the price tag. Lastly, the fast charging nature of this phone puts me in awe. I use the phone for hours on end and yes the battery drains like a normal phone does, but then all I have to do is plug it in and my phone gets charged in no time! I can also keep playing my games, video chatting and having multiple apps and webpages open with no lag and without pausing to let the phone charge, and a regular car charger gets my phone charged even when I have Waze or Google Maps on.Overall I highly recommend this phone, if it somehow died I would buy another one without hesitation. This phone is comparable to flagships in terms of design and basic features one looks for in a phone. And for the price it truly is unbeatable without being inferior."
"Alcatel",5,"good"
"Alcatel",5,"Surprisingly good quality phone considering the low price compared to other phones. Have had it for over a week and dropped it twice and did not break or scratch. Has a decent amount of space with options to upgrade. Able to play all my games without any lag and plenty of room on the screen to see everything."
"Alcatel",5,"Quality is amazing for the price .. Audio is nice, camera quality is pretty decent, charges very quickly and lasts for the day.. Well (It depends on how much you use it.) But to be honest, this is by far the best 100 bucks I've ever spent 😁Advise: Get a screen protecter, preferably glass and you're fine."
"Alcatel",1,"Phone died after 30 days of use. Tried to restart phone, but phone started continuously powering on and off, rendering it unusable. A quick google search reveals that this is a common problem for this phone. Save yourself the trouble and do not buy it."
"Alcatel",5,"Excellent phone for the price! Huge screen, beautiful, very light and the best speakers in a phone. Also the speakers are up and down and front facing so if you use it landscape mode you get excellent stereo (and loud) sound (e.g., for videos)."
"Alcatel",5,"Thin and fast, nice screen"
"Alcatel",5,"Bought this smartphone for just $99 here 2 weeks ago.GoodThe screen is the best that I ever seen (comparative with iPhone 6+). The JBL stereo speakers are fantastic! Ultra clear sound! Android 6.0.1 in the latest update OTA made this phone very fast.BadBoth cameras are rather weak in a poor light places. Even my old iPhone 5 takes much better photos in low light places without a flash. The rear camera is OK in a daylight. Although I still prefer iPhone 5 for taking photos.I've already noticed that the phone lost wifi connection 2 times being connected to the charger. That is strange.According to the reviews here any screen protector is a must have thing for this phone."
"Alcatel",5,"Great full featured phone at a great price."
"Alcatel",3,"Bought this phone on pre order. Nice screen, perfomance was ok and got better with the Marshmallow update, audio quality was amazing, also the included headphones were nice (they lasted 8 months). Phone stoped working one week after the warranty expired."
"Alcatel",5,"Awesome phone. Crystal Clear display. Loud speakers. I don't see the lag issues other have reported. Updated software and I am pleased with the camera. Looking forward to Android 5.1 update from Alcatel."
"Alcatel",5,"It is an amazing phone"
"Alcatel",5,"This is defiantly the best phone I have ever owned! The speakers are phenomenal! They are loud, clear, and do have a little bit of bass! The display is also one of the best on any budget phone! Also the camera isn't bad either! But to wrap it all up, this is the best phone under $300!"
"Alcatel",5,"I've had this phone for about a month & I have nothing but good thing to say about it. Here's what I think after one month:PRO- Inexpensive, loud stereo speakers, some nifty & unique features, good (day) camera & very slim profile and not to mention very light- Good battery: the battery should last a day even with heavy use. I'm not a heavy user and mine actually lasted one & half day with single charge.- Bright large 5.5"" full HD (1080P) screen.- Unlocked, no contract and no preloaded garbage apps- Able to add more memory up to 128 GB using microSD card.CONS- Handling: This is a big phone so the combination of size, thinness and low weight will be an issue for small hands.- Performance is somewhat sluggish when compared to my older phones such as LG G3, Note 3 and my Fire phone.- Low light photography - Indoor & @ night, must use flash.- Battery is not replaceable.- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -This is my second Alcatel phone. After my first one which was returned promptly I vowed not to buy another but after reading the reviews & partly because of Amazon one day special sale (got it for $199) I gave it a try. And now, I think this phone is worth every penny. This is by far the best phone Alcatel has made. They were able to put some mid to premium features into this phone and sell at a very low budget price.DESIGN & BUILTThis phone is very elegent. It got rounded edges framing a metalic like body. The screen sits slightly over the JBL speakers on top and bottom which makes the overall look very unique. The back camera takes great outdoor photos during the day but at night you'll need to use flash.SPECIAL FEATURES- Reversible interface - Phone has speakers and microphone on top and bottom and once you activate the feature, it doesn't matter which side you hold up to make or receive calls. I've never seen this feature on any other phone before.- Double-tap lock screen feature - They copied this from LG G series phones. The implementation of it though is somewhat sluggish. You have to tap it a few times before the screen turns on or off.CAMERA- IDOL3 has a 13-megapixel auto-focus rear camera, and an above average 8-megapixel front-facing for selfies. The lens is flush to the back, so there’s no raised section like the new iPhone or Galaxy S6 and others. On the software side, the layout is simple but it does come with a variety of shooting modes and interestingly there is also a manual mode with shutter speed control. The camera delivers decent looking photos in moderately lit conditions with nice details and saturated colors. However, it seems to struggle with low lit situation and with no flash, you get hazy details with some noticeable noise. But on the plus side, it does have electronic image stabilization feature which helps to keep things steady especially when you're working with the manual mode with low shutter speed. Also the latest OTA update has significantly improved the camera's performance. Colors look nicer, it focus better and snaps photos faster. If you get this phone be sure to get the latest OTA update.BATTERY PEFORMANCEThe 2910 mAH last me the full day and even after 24 hours I still had 30% left and so this is one big plus for this phone.Overall I highly recommend this phone. There are very few phones that can match the features with such a low price. Oneplus one (last year version) which is now readily available is the one of only two true competitor. That phone is faster but its 64 GB version is $75 more and with IDOL 3 you can add up to 128 GB of SD so from that standpoint its ahead. The other phone is Zenfone 2 which is $50 more but from what I read, there's a lot of shortcoming with that phone. Anyway, if you're looking for a feature rich, low price, no contract phone, you can't go wrong with IDOL 3."
"Alcatel",5,"Best Phone I've owned so far, it is just amazing. i Love it. it is just as described. The sound quality is amazing, the Speed, the Camera, the gaming capabilities, watching videos on this device gives you the best experience, everything about this phone is awesome.For only $250.00 this is the best phone there is."
"Alcatel",5,"I'm glad I waited when it dropped in price to purchase this and yes I love it cause I'm hard of hearing and the speakers are loud for me, unlike other devices I've had. I would recommend this for anyone who's hard of hearing.I was deciding between this and the Asus ZenFone2 and went by reviews both had good reviews, but I went with the Idol.The camera is good, but I use a different camera app with it for more effects.The battery life is great and it charges quickly more than an Android tablet I have.The screen is nice and clear, the ease of access is good and Alcatel does do the update, for it when it lets you know for an OTA.The only non-issues I have that's there's not enough accessories being the fact it's been out for a few months. Been looking for a Qi charging receiver, tho Alcatel has one, but no one has made a review for it on here. B 3 bottom right is what I'm searching for.I really don't do reviews, but this I thought I would do."
"Alcatel",5,"For the price, the only device that can compare to this for the price is the zenfone 2. The zf2 has a more powerful processor, GPU and 2x the ram for $50 more. Even though I'm usually all about specifications on my devices, I don't play graphically intense games on my phone. (that's what a PC or console is for in my opinion) So I'll take the better screen, slimmer profile, almost completely stock version of Android and the dual JBL audio front facing speakers any day over the slight difference in performance.I've seen some reviews of people receiving units with a few annoying problems but I'm assuming those are either factory defects or refurbished units because I've had nothing but good experiences so far with mine.If I had to find something negative to say about this phone, I'd say the power button placement doesn't make sense at all even for a lefty. But the factory software does allow for double tap to wake and the display does rotate 180° in portrait which takes care of the button placement for the most part. The second thing is that I've noticed a few stutters here and there, and considering I came from a note 3 with the SD800, these slight stutters happen so infrequently that it doesn't bother me and I didn't really pay attention to them till I read about it in some reviews. Either way, I'm pretty sure this is because of the software optimization because other SD615 devices run smother. Hopefully an update to 5.1 or even marshmallow will cure this. If not, bootloader is already unlocked, root is her and there's already twrp available. Custom ROMs should be available soon too."
"Alcatel",5,"Got this when my Nexus 5 died and was amazed at the progress made in android phones since I got the N5 a year ago. For less than half the price of my N5 I got a phone with comparable screen, better battery (being able to charge my phone 1/day is a game changer), better speakers, better camera. Granted the Idol doesn't have the benchmarks of the N5 (or the ZenPhone2) but I haven't noticed it at all in everyday use.If you want a great unlocked phone (with all the GSM LTE bands) and don't want to pay $600, get this phone."
"Alcatel",2,"Terrible call quality, multiple people told me during calls on speakerphone that I sounded far away and that they couldn't hear me well. Maybe it's due to the speakers during calls. I promptly returned. I wonder if the 4.7 inch version also has this same problem"
"Alcatel",3,"Great phone while it worked right but still Luke other Alcatel phones the power button failed to work"
"Alcatel",5,"Great phone for the price."
"Alcatel",5,"I love the phone. It works perfectly."
"Alcatel",5,"This is a great phone and a good price. It is comparable to any other big name phone out there at the moment and only a fraction of the cost. Works great with StraightTalk and Net10 services.It is a very thin phone compared to most so. I felt like I may break it because its so thin, but it has held up well. Adding a tempered glass screen protector made it feel a lot more sturdy."
"Alcatel",4,"overall a very good phone and great value for its price.would love to have physical buttons, though, used to the samsung notes. there's sufficient real estate to put that in also."
"Alcatel",5,"Its doesn't have the Samsung or the Apple brand name but don't let that stop you. The screen is fantastic, the speakers are loud and i easily get one and a half days off of a single charge with heavy use. for $250.00 you get a phone that can do almost everything that any other flagship phone can do and in some cases more. (it has SD card slot and NFC). Please note though that it does not use gorilla glass. i got a couple scratches on my screen pretty early on. It could just be from me being careless but i would strongly recommend buying a case. its a pretty thin phone so it shouldn't be a problem"
"Alcatel",3,"Lots of features for the price. Nice screen. Definitely made me wonder why my Motorola Nexus 6 is priced so much higher. (I got the Alcatel for my mother.)However, the SD card/SIM dual tray is awful. I couldn't get a SIM card inside, without ripping out the SD card electronics. Phone still works, but that terrible design choice makes me wary."
"Alcatel",1,"I read Amazon reviews on this product, and determined that the Alcatel ONETOUCH IDOL 3 would fit my needs perfectly due to the product specifications and price point. I could not be more wrong. I have switched brands of cell phones over the years, varying from Apple, LG, Motorola RAZR, Nokia, and even Cingular phones. Nothing I have used in the last ten years has been as fragile and poorly made as this one. While reaching into my pocket to read a text message I just received, I went to swipe my phone to unlock. However, the glass surface (digitizer) of the phone would not recognize my swipes, and started trying to swipe all on its own. I thought this was bizarre, and upon closer inspection there were some small cracks on the top left corner of the phone. After trying to swipe further, the crack spread all the way from the top left to the center right of the digitizer, effectively making the phone useless. Since this was in my pocket previously, I have no idea how it cracked, since it was working fine and had no issues throughout the day. It is utterly pathetic that this product broke INSIDE my pocket, and their customer service team has been even worse in terms of honoring any warranty or protection from this brittle, cheaply-made phone. I would recommend any other smartphone instead of this one, because it is not acceptable in 2015 to have phones so fragile you must bubble wrap them before storage.Summary: If you are looking for an unlocked phone, go with another brand, because it will actually work and not break inside your pocket within two months of purchase. Just go here (http://www.amazon.com/gp/bestsellers/wireless/2407749011/ref=s9_acsd_ri_bw_clnk?pf_rd_m=ATVPDKIKX0DER&pf_rd_s=merchandised-search-5&pf_rd_r=0MPS87YSGRVP9GKHPS5D&pf_rd_t=101&pf_rd_p=2153843082&pf_rd_i=2407749011_p0_h) and make sure whatever you do, never, EVER get an Alcatel ONETOUCH Idol 3."
"Alcatel",4,"I do not like the camera. it has a vary shallow field, there will be a small area in the four ground that is clear and everything else is blurry. don't expect to be getting any quick shots with this phone, you have to hold it perfectly still. I f the camera is important don't but this phone; it is terrible.The JBL sound is really nice, the phone sounds great. one of my priority needs since I like to listen to music while walking.The phone runs smooth with apps loading relatively quickly.."
"Alcatel",5,"Great phone for the price paid."
"Alcatel",1,"Phone stopped working after a software update in just month 2 of ownership. I have made 5 attempts to get phone fixed through customer service and have been unsuccessful each time. Do not buy."
"Alcatel",4,"I wanted to give the phone 5 stars...but some worries keep me from it. The good stuff is outstanding, and what little bad stuff there is is easy to overcome. It's an amazing phone for a great price point. Except...(I'll get to that in a minute).PROS:--Great screen and visibility. Even in bright sunlight and from different angles, the screen is sharp and easy to see. I purchased a tempered glass screen protector, but that might be overkill.--The internal radios are fine. I have no trouble picking up AT&T LTE signals.--Super stereo effect from the twin JBL speakers with good volume when listening in speaker mode.--Great form factor. Though the phone is big, it's very slim and fits the hand easily, and it looks great. I bought a sturdy case in part to keep the screen from contacting tabletops and to give it a little extra ""grip,"" though.--For basic day-to-day use, the battery is amazing. With ordinary call activity and web surfing, I can get 2+ days easily.--The flip feature, letting you use the phone easily right side up or upside down is really cool.--While some complain about the placement of the power button high on the left edge, I like it. I tend to use the phone in my left hand, so that works well for me.--It's (almost) pure Android, so very intuitive.--The cameras produce excellent photos in decent light...but...MINOR CONS:--As others have noted, the pix are noisy in less-than-ideal lighting. The preloaded camera app is awkward to use, but I simply added Open Camera (free on Google Play).--Several of the other pre-loaded apps are weak to worthless, but easy enough to ignore.--For as good as the speakers are in speakerphone mode, they sound rather tinny in standard mode.MAJOR CON:--Here's what has me worried. This baby gets REALLY hot really quickly when watching videos or playing games. I'm concerned that over time, that will be a huge issue for battery longevity. I'm not a big gamer or video watcher, but if you are, you'd be well served looking for something else."
"Alcatel",3,"It's a decent phone and very attractive looking. Coming from using an S5 Galaxy, it's lacks many custom features on the messaging app that comes by default on S5. Can't personalize view, can't schedule text messaging, very limited message size - etc. The camera on the ph lacks decent zoom. Otherwise, there is nothing wrong with this phone from a hardware perspective."
"Alcatel",1,"T-Mobile talked Alcatel into removing band 12 now I have no LTE signal another piece of junk T-Mobile phone. If you have T-Mobile and one of these there is a class action lawsuit being filed against Alcatel for doing it. I have a less than 3 month old paperweight now !!!!! I am not buy another Alcatel anything and dropping T-Mobile because this is the reason they are still number 3 !!!! DO NOT BUY THIS JUNK IF YOU ARE A T-MOBILE CUSTOMER IT WILL OTA AN UPDATE AND THAT WILL MAKE IT USELESS !!!!!"
"Alcatel",5,"Best phone in its budget, still prefer my one plus 2 but so dope"
"Alcatel",5,"Love this phone takes awesome pictures and is good for music has amazing sound."
"Alcatel",1,"Phone looks good. But not comparable to other similar phones. I had T-Mobile SIM card, it does not work some times. Camera stopped working completely. When I start camera App, it closes automatically. I installed other camera Apps, only front camera works. Back camera does not work.Overall, I don't recommend this phone.I called customer service. Nobody answers and get disconnected after 1 or 2 mins. Tried several times, it is same."
"Alcatel",4,"works ok with T-Moble. I love the phone itself."
"Alcatel",1,"I bought this phone in July of 2015, and I loved it so much, but I do speak of it in the past tense for a reason. The beginning of June 2016 it died on me. The phone is now just boot loops every time I try to turn it on. I tried to get ahold of the customer service, and they tried to talk me through resetting it through the boot menu(which I had already done), and the call dropped, and they never called me back. I would love to give it a better review, but less then a year later it is as good as a brick."
"Alcatel",5,"Flagship features at budget price"
"Alcatel",1,"This phone is HORRIBLY slow. It crashes at least once a week. Android device manager doesn't locate it."
"Alcatel",5,"I cannot compare this Smartphone to any other product because this is the only smart phone I've ever had.I bought it a year ago because it was unlocked and I could use my Tracfone Account and because of its many features so that I could use it for virtual reality, gaming and 4G LTE phone.I am writing this review after year of owning this phone and I have to say I am still totally happy with it. I have to stifle the impulse to say I am amazed at the quality and usefulness of this device.I bought it with Android 5.0 1 and recently it updated - 6.01. I didn't know it would do that! It was a bonus.My only problem is the 16 gigabytes. The Android operating system does not use the SD card efficiently, and so I had problems with filling your memory with too many apps and data. This is not a problem with the phone but more a problem with the operating system. Although if the phone has more memory that would have been a solution for me.This phone has been a joy for me and I would recommend to anyone!"
"Alcatel",4,"Love it it's amazing the only negative so far is if you try and do too much at once it will freeze but that's expected"
"Alcatel",4,"Didn't get my SIM removal tool but used an earring. Other than that it's a great phone."
"Alcatel",5,"Solid phone after 24 hours. It gets the job done with no software hiccups. It looks better in hand than in photos."
"Alcatel",5,"Love this phone. Excellent battery life. Really good front camera. Great operating system.I would change a little the rear camera. It's good but take too long to stabalize and not take blurry photos.In general I would really recommend it for the price."
"Alcatel",1,"After using the phone for about 9 months, the phone started to have shut off and started problem. Since it is under warranty, I sent it back and have it fixed. After 2 months, my phone was freezing on me. I need to send in and have it fixed again before the warranty expires. When I searched the web, it is a common problem of this phone. I will not recommend this phone."
"Alcatel",2,"I’ll cut to the chase – the reason I’m giving this phone 2 stars is because I consistently am having problems with calls where the call is going fine initially then all of the sudden I can hear the other person but they cannot hear me. It happens very often and frequently at my house. I have a Lumia that will take the SIM card and work – when I put the SIM in that phone and use it I have absolutely ZERO issues with calls. I’ve tried contacting Alcatel support by emailing their support (have been waiting a week without response) and I’ve also tried calling. When I call I sit on hold for about 15 minutes (did it from work where my phone shows the time of the call) before I give up and hang up. I’m shopping for a new phone now because of it which sucks because it means I pretty much threw away ~$180.00."
"Alcatel",5,"way better than my Samsung phone"
"Alcatel",5,"Awesome phone. My first smart phone and it's been nothing but great. Not sure how I loved without a smart phone before. Easy to navigate and use. Very intuitive."
"Alcatel",5,"I love this phone!!!"
"Alcatel",4,"The first one I got I had to send back because the LED notifications light was stuck on, even when I turn it off in the settings. Amazon sent a replacement, so all is well. I really like this phone. It operates fast enough to where I don't notice any delay, I really like the display, and I really like the minimum changes that they made to Android. I have had a few other phones in the last couple years, and I always prefer stock Android to other heavily modded UIs. I don't know why other companies think they can improve on something I am sure Google spent a lot of time developing...Pros- UI- The reversible speaker and home screen. I prefer having the headphone jack at the bottom when listening to music.- ScreenCons- My only complaint is that the double tap on feature doesn't work consistently. I think this has to do with the lock screen being engaged or not, or possibly how long the device has been asleep. I hope they fix it in the next few"
"Alcatel",5,"phone is great, and awesome bang for the buck. i knew the camera wasn't great from reading reviews, but in actuality it is worse than i thought. very grainy in anything but full sunlight and even then the auto focus works about 1 out of 5 times. video shooting is a little better. if you plan on taking a lot of photos pass on the phone, otherwise it's a great phone.oh, plan on taking a lot of screen shots. volume down + power = screen shot, and when trying to turn the screen off with one hand using the power button, the volume button is placed perfectly to end up taking a screen shot!UPDATE: Alcatel really supports this phone, they have done 3 software updates so far, and the camera is now performing much better. Vary happy that they are putting in effort to support the handset"
"Alcatel",2,"First cell I got and the two-tap on/off feature didn't work. I bought new one and am returning that defective one for refund. Are the boxes supposed to be sealed with plastic wrap because the second phone I got wasn't wrapped in plastic,... Forgot if the first one was. Great speaker and screen. I first bought an Asus zenfone 2 but returned that because the speaker and screen were incredibly bad. Idol 3 totally beats in those respects. Will update over time.Update 7-11-15.I returned first idol 3 and got replacement because double tap didn't work. And now on the replacement, double tap still barely works. It taps off but doesn't always tap back on. This is the reason i returned the first phone. I can't be only one having this issue. Other than that, good phone for now.***update 9-13-15***After months of use, I'm returning for galaxy s4. Thanks amazon for letting me. The idol, as much as I wanted to like and keep, is too slow and laggy and is sometimes unresponsive. Double tap on and off decides on its own when it wants to work, I hit call button twice sometimes because it doesn't respond the first time I try and the swype to text on the phone doesn't work well; it's as if my finger gets caught up/stuck on the screen and it doesn't make the word or forms incorrect word.Its just too slow and unresponsive for me. When I clear the screens with button on bottom right, the slowness shows as the framerate is horribly choppy. Plus the battery is built in. My new s4 has a removeable battery.The things I liked were speakers in front and screen, but the slowness and unresponsive nature of device made me switch."
"Alcatel",5,"It is great!!!"
"Alcatel",5,"Loved it!Sadly mine was defective, and had to go back. Great feel, screen, battery. Would buy again!!!"
"Alcatel",5,"Ok so a lot of people have the following needs for a phone: using email, web browsing, listening to music, texting/making calls, casual game playing. A lot of those people buy $700 phones to just meet those needs. The alcatel idol 3 is a fraction of that cost without any compromises in those areas. It looks feels and sounds like a classy flagship. It doesnt have the tech horse power of a 700 dollar phone, meaning if you do a lot of multitasking and high-end gaming then this probably isnt your best choice. But iv seen a lot of people mention minor lag and i can say: in terms of basic normal use there is no lag what so ever. If youre looking for something that can dazzle on a budget for the average user, this will deliver. I do wonder about the durability in the long run. The screen sits on top of the device in a way that makes me think its probably not the hardest thing to break. If youre a person that likes to go case-less, i would probably consider going with a case here. But so far i have no reasons to complain. This is a cool phone, and when you factor in the price, its a really cool phone."
"Alcatel",4,"I won't rehash what's already been said about this phone. Overall I think it's a good package for the price. Three problems I have which may warrant its return are the fact that I can't get a LTE Signal on StraightTalk (AT&T Network - could be SIM card related; still investigating), can't get it to pair with my 2012 Ford F-150 Sync System (non-touch screen version) and can't get the swipe function on the keyboard to work. A vivid, bright screen, decent speakers and low price can't make up for basic functionality I rely on everyday. I'll mess around with it some more but will likely return if I can't get these features to work. I'm coming from a Google/LG Nexus 4 that took a bath in a lake and I'm missing that phone already. I do find the Idol 3 to have more lag than my Nexus 4, which was running KitKat, not Lollipop.Update: Turned out that the Bluetooth pairing problem was on the Sync end. Following a master reset of Sync the phone paired effortlessly for both phone and media audio. Haven't tried text to speech yet though. I downloaded the Google Keyboard app and swipe function has been restored. Apparently it is a well documented issue that the stock keyboard app doesn't support swipe gestures. I've upped the review to 4-stars. A little more processing performance & less lag would garner a 5 star rating."
"Alcatel",5,"No issues"
"Alcatel",5,"Awsome budget phone just a little laggy but overall great"
"Alcatel",5,"1. screen is large and bright2. voice/sound is clear3. battery lasts a long time."
"Alcatel",5,"So far I am loving this phone. Can't find anything bad to say."
"Alcatel",5,"Great price and phone works great!!"
"Alcatel",2,"No Chinese support!! This is a phone made from Chinese brand!! Why???? this should be inlcuded on lroduct description!!! ...Otherwise very nice phone."
"Alcatel",3,"This is a decent budget phone however the screen is very easy to break. Once it breaks it will keep randomly tapping places on your screen. The description talks about a two year warranty so hopefully that will be honored."
"Alcatel",2,"I am not sure I am keeping it. The camera is great but the functionality is just awkward. The phone turn off by itself. I am using map my run to record my runs and the phone just turned off and this happened all the time I use it to record my workout. The good thing about this phone is probably the camera and the charge. It hold the charge pretty good, with all the apps on it and video call,I manage to stay away from the charger for 2 full days. I kept it for a week now but i am returning it.Just to update my rating, so i live in an apt on 10th floor and I can't get a fair signal, when outside I get the 4G LTE signal ,then at my work I get H+ what ever that is and of course I have no service in the basement. From different places, the signal jump and the Bluetooth is on and off in my car and sometimes I am on the phone and all is just blank, nothing I can still see the signal strength either H+ or 4G LTE.I default storage for picture and video to SD card and that is not working, I have to manually do that and clear the phone memory which is already used with all the apps. Definitely, the phone is going back I am not sure which phone to buy on budget."
"Alcatel",5,"excellent"
"Alcatel",5,"worked great for me in St Lucia. with a World Travel SIM card."
"Alcatel",5,"Item as described."
"Alcatel",2,"It's affordable and looks great which is what I needed.However it freezes up a lot and I'm on my second one.If you need something affordable, get it.I must warn you though I have to return my second one because it's going crazy and Amazon almost didn't let me return it because it is out of the return window. It's cute and it works okay but the bad kind of outweighs the good. If you can avoid it and purchase a Samsung or something then I would suggest doing that. I paid 220 for it and now it's 250...no."
"Alcatel",2,"After less than 2 month of use, i'm having dead spots right in the middle of the screen."
"Alcatel",5,"So first phone I received had some problems, but they were very cooperative at getting me a new one and I got it very fast. This phone has blown me away with what you get with the price. The audio is amazing its up there with the HTC one m8 in my opinion. Only complaint I have is that the original one I recieveced had very nice jbl headphones, and the second one had much cheaper headphones. That doesn't concern the phone but that was quite the disappointment. Had the phone for several months now and I still hold it in the highest regard. Blows the HTC one I had before this, out of the water in every way. And now its 30$ cheaper then when I got it. Even more of a steal."
"Alcatel",5,"This thing is awesome. The battery life is great, i get 4-5 hours of screen on time with half brightness which is great because the speakers cannot be beaten at this price point. They sure beat my old HTC One M7 boom sound speakers. I bought this phone and a case along with a 64 gig Sandisk memory card all under 280 dollars. I like to watch a lot of media so the beautiful big screen and dual front facing speakers is was sold me. The camera is not the best in the world, but more than enough for social media. You can take some real nice shots with it. All in all its a great phone!"
"Alcatel",5,"So far, so good!"
"Alcatel",5,"The size is perfect for average guy. It's large enough for typing w/ 2 thumbs, and small enough for use w/ one hand.The phone is light. So it doesn't bounce around in pants pocket.The battery life is good for a lite user. With cell data mostly off, I typically get 3-4 days.The case design allows secure fit for the soft shell, while exposing the forward facing speakers. Make sure to get a shell, or it might not survive a drop.The only downside is the SD card. It is in the same tray as the Sim card. When I take it out to transfer large files, sometimes it takes a few tries to get both cards aligned when inserting."
"Alcatel",5,"Alcatel Onetouch Idol 3 5.5 has certainly done right this time. The phone can't compete with the top flagship phones today, but for its price, you can't really complain. Phone is nicely designed and it is almost as thin as a iphone 6+. Phone has a beautiful display and loud speakers that you can compete with the flagship phones today. That's where the difference ends. It has a slower snapdragon 615 cpu 2gigs of memory, no removable battery, nfc and wireless/quick charge. One design quirk that I don't like is the placement of the power and volume rocker. Most phones has power button to the right and volume rockers to the left, this is just the opposite. Not to mention that the power button is so high up in the phone. The phone looks nice but not very well protected so you should definitely get a case for it. Software is Lollipop 5.0.2 rather than 5.1.1 that other flagship offers. Although I can't complain about the almost stock android experience which works fine for me. You definitely need a micro sd card if you want to put movies and mp3's as I only have 7 gigs free without having any media files stored internally. I hope that Alcatel can offer software updates like what the other flagship phones does.Should you get this phone, yes, but I would wait for Alcatel phone goes on sale as I brought mine for less than $200.Pro's- Has a beautiful 1080p display.- Very nice stereo speakers- FM tuner- Band 12 LTE for t-mobile phones- Nice, nice and thin design while maintaining a 2915 mah battery.Cons- Placement of power and volume rockers- Slower Snapdragon 615 cpu with 2 gigs of memory.- No NFC, wireless and quick charging- Android 5.0.2 rather than 5.1.1"
"Alcatel",4,"korea KT 3G data speed not good...."
"Alcatel",5,"well love the phone just wish some one would come up with a battery case for it, maybe one with wireless charging. it seems like a no brainer for all these phablets."
"Alcatel",4,"working fine. It is totally surprise.. Never thought such kind of performance ... Only issues with low light picture.."
"Alcatel",5,"What are u waiting for its ether between this or the moto g"
"Alcatel",5,"Coming from a nexus 5, this was definitely a good upgrade. The screen is just amazing, the best screen I've seen on a phone. It's vibrant and bright (even in bright sunlight). I really hope the next version has more RAM and a better camera. The current camera is good but nothing to write home about. It's definitely better than the nexus 5 (2013) and the moto g and it's not fair to compare it to flagship phones. The speakers are ridiculously good (stereo too!!). It comes with JBL headsets, which are way better than the other standard headsets you get these days (if you're lucky to get one that is). The screen size is great. The next model should definitely have quick charge, a bigger battery (even though the current one lasts almost 12 hours on medium-high use and at 70% brightness, this includes watching videos, listening to music a lot and reading articles every hour). The SD card is a huge advantage, seriously this phone is a winner. Also, the most important part, it's pretty much stock Android!!! Which is really the star of the show here. Would recommend this to anyone interested in a good phone."
"Alcatel",5,"Excelent cell and Good price"
"Alcatel",4,"i like the phone weight and speakers its one of the best available in this price ranger"
"Alcatel",5,"Great phone for price! Nice big 5.5 inch full HD display.Nearly stock android. Dual front speakers is a plus!"
"Alcatel",5,"Good Price and Good phone!"
"Alcatel",5,"Pluses:Price: about $100 (can't believe this much phone for the money)Display: 1080P while it's not AMOLED, really pretty for the $Sound: stereo speakers rock. Easily the best sound I've ever heard from a phone. While it's not loud enough for a large party, it is great for at home listening.Camera: 13MP camera takes good pictures. Low light is not excellent but, again, for the price, very nice.Expandable memory: Has a double slot for Sim and micro SD card. Even my Moto X didn't do that.Battery: Makes it through the whole day with moderately heavy use. You can kill it if you try hard enough but I usually have half a charge left after a long day.Minuses: There appears to be no way to stop ""full battery"" notifications. If you have it by your bed at night, it is annoying to be notified of a full battery at 3AM.Speed: While adequate, there is some lag with multiple applications open. To me, just mildly irritating but this might be a deal breaker for power users."
"Alcatel",5,"Luv luv luv my phone"
"Alcatel",5,"Using at&t go phone sim...operates 6.01 marshmellow ...more than enough phone. I', in the boonies and gets reception."
"Alcatel",4,"The screen is very bright and sharp but not as colorful as a Super AMOLED screen. The speakers are very loud and clear. compared to others. There is processor lag when overloaded with tasks. I don't mind not having a fingerprint sensor because this is a mid range phone after all. Camera is pretty good. I prefer polished aluminum but the design of this plastic phone is very beautiful. Good durability in my opinion when properly cased AND screen protected of coarse. Has survived many drops from my kiddos. The user interface is almost stock Android, very easy to navigate. This is a perfect starter phone for a younger adolescent,older adult or daily user on the go."
"Alcatel",5,"Great phone, great price. I shopped around for a budget-priced phone with up to date specs. I spent days on this, and decided on this phone because it was $100 less than I was willing to spend but it still had everything I needed. My only concern at purchase was I thought battery life would be an issue coming off a phone with a 5000 MaH battery I had with the BLU Studio Energy 2. What I do is go into settings and turn on battery saver immediately after taking the phone off the charger. That way I get about 18 hours of fairly active use, calling, texting, streaming video, listening to audio. Then I put on charger and am ready for the next day. It has a 2950 MaH battery but lasts more like a 4000 MaH one on battery saver mode. Phone is super fast with octa-core processor, even running on battery saver - I can't really tell the difference in performance, but it's limiting the background processes that drain the juice out of most phones. Phone ships with Android 5.1, but it quickly upgrades to the newer Android Marshmallow 6.0 software upon initial bootup. Also, phone has an 8MP selfie camera, 5MP is standard on many phones which is ice. The front camera is decent at 13MP, on par with a Samsung S6. Nice display and beautiful video. At 5.5"" it's the right size and the build quality is impressive. Good sound from the JBL twin speakers, you can actually hear. Call quality seems to be good (I'm on Cricket), and the speakerphone comes in loud and clear. It even comes with NFC built-in if that's important to you. Overall, it's a 5-star phone at a 3-star price point and it has my highest recommendation."
"Alcatel",5,"Phone came in perfect conditions, fast shipping, it's a game changer, best phone for his price, specs, screen, batery.Just one thign it's that lag in his original Android 5.0, update after purchased to marshmallow y voila u have a awesome flashkiller"
"Alcatel",2,"I just got it today. I installed all of my apps and tested it out.Pros:CheapStylishSound qualityVideosCons:Not as fast as I thought it would beTerrible mic/recordingTerrible with popular apps such as snapchat/instagramCamera quality goes significantly down if you zoom inOnce in awhile it will stop detecting the sim cardI have been using this phone since June 2015. Now I am going to back to the flagship phone...learned my lesson."
"Alcatel",5,"I will start by saying that I buy the majority of my electronics and phones from Amazon because I'm too lazy to do research for the best possible price. With that being said I literally stumbled upon the Idol 3 pre-order page and said what the heck. 199.99 what could I lose. Well last week when I received it I was stunned by what I got. This phone specs may not be jaw dropping but the way it's all put together is amazing. The signal reception is great. The camera is great. The app load times is great. Overall you cannot go wrong by giving Alcatel a try on this one. Sure they make budget phones but this in my opinion is far from a budget phone. I have a weekly rotation of phones I use but this has been one of my daily drivers for 2 weeks."
"Alcatel",2,"Pro's1. very well built.2. speakers better then expected, JBL earbuds that came with the phone are great.3. chargers very quickly.4. camera is good, not poor, not great, just good, will be testing some more, will re-post here soon.5. very little to no lag for me, every user is different. I text, make calls, email, pictures of my kids, no games. again every user experience will vary. again NO LAG!!! for me.6. the price THE PRICE. $249.00.7. better then my oneplus one, experience. leaps and bounds.8. bright notification light9. very light10. the screen is really really bright, hands on of the brightest screens i have ever used. example my iphone 6 plus at 50%, my nokia 930 at 70%, my note 3 at 55%, my lg g3 at 75%, the phone i have at 25% again 25%11. the price lol $249!!! again $249!!purchase this phone and see and experience for yourselves, and remember you can always send it back if you are not satisfied.. that's the beauty of purchasing from amazon.will come back in one to two weeks, will see if my rating of 5 stars stays or changes.Update 6/10/2015Okay LTE speeds on AT&T are great at least in my area.Camera I would compare to the nexus 5, with nexus 5 slightly better.Lag, yes when lots of apps are running. Not to bad for a mid range phone.Screen very good, though it does kill the battery life pretty quick, and I have it at 30%.brightness.Battery life lasting about a day and a half with moderate use, social media, texting, emails, calls. Build quality doesn't worry me to much right now. No creeks. For 250 definitely a worthy backup, but flagship? no.update6/15/2015battery life just kept on getting worse, turned off location GPS, sync, and all apps in the background, standby time kept on taking a hit. biggest culprit was the screen it self. one full charge would only last me a about 20 hours, not even a whole day.and proximity sensor stopped working. just glad it happened with in the return period."
"Alcatel",2,"I think that some of them defective and I just got one of the defective onesVery slowBad signalScreen colors look fadedBluetooth week signalNot always switch between landscapes to portraitThe good about the one I have is the speakersAnd the battery lifeYou can't exchange only Send it back and get ur money back which in my case its 199 when new one cost 249"
"Alcatel",3,"Update December 30th, 2015:* I had to downgrade my rating to a 3 star because after 6 months of usage the phone is noticeably showing wear and tear of being a cheap phone. I had no illusion that the phone would be masterfully constructed at the price point. At this point I can feel that the phone creaks if bent a little bit, and I can see that my screen cover's glue has come off at one edge. To top this off the camera has failed me recently, and I'm in the process of submitting a warranty claim. If that goes well and this are better, then I'll consider bumping the star rating back up to 4 stars....Original Review follows, and all of these things are still true for me. I do really love what this phone got right, its just too bad its not constructed better...Here are a few thing that should make you want this phone:* The Camera app - Alcatel seems to have made their own camera app, and do not use the Android stock app (which if you want you could install from the app store). But this app I feel like is superior to the android one. It does virtually no hunting for focus, and takes photos immediately when you press the shutter button. I feel like this gives the camera a distinctly Apple Iphone feel to it, and have been pleasantly surprised. The Google Camera app does not function as smoothly, and am glad to have an alternative with the Alcatel. Others have commented on the actual camera photo quality itself, which I have not tested, but honestly for my use I'm glad that the app just functions fast.* The phone is pretty much stock android. I put the Google Now Launcher on my phone and the experience is almost exactly the same as my old Nexus 4. There are a few pre-loaded apps, but you can easily remove them. The ones that you can't remove are system apps like the android gallery, and the Mix application which is a music player. Both can be ignored for your applications of choice.With that said, other reviews have done a good job of describing the phone and its pros and cons. I just wanted to add the only reason I can't give it a 5, is that while it is awesome for the price, it still has its drawbacks. It does so many things great, and they got many features totally right. But after using it for 4 or 5 days, I begin to notice the areas where they had to cut corners to get it to the price it is at. These things have been mentioned in other reviews already. With that said. Its amazing how much they do for the price, but they haven't quite hidden the reasons you might want a more expensive phone, in my opinion. If you're already in the market for spending this much, instead of buying something much more expensive, then I can say you should definitely just buy it and try it out."
"Alcatel",5,"Nice smartphone"
"Alcatel",5,"for 250 this phone is pretty good i wanted to buy an unlocked phone that i can use with any gsm carrier i feel i made the right choice with this, coming from an iphone 6 plus you can tell its a little slower when browsing the web but the rest is fine with me i also love that i can extend my memory with an sd card, i am also happy this has lte im paying $35 A MONTH now for unl talk n text and 2gb of LTE cant beat that"
"Alcatel",4,"I moved from a Note II (T-Mobile) to this Idol 3. I got tired of carrying around a phone that had extra weight and size due to a stylus I never used. I got in on the original pre-order price of $200 and decided to give it a try. I have had the phone a little over a week and would like to run down some of my thoughts.- I like the screen, it is clear and bright and I don’t find myself missing my AMOLED from my Note II.- The screen is very visible in direct sunlight, way better than my Note II, wife’s S3 or G2.- I do not mind the left side power button (I’m left handed) but it takes some getting used to.- Regarding the above I am aware the phone has a double tap to wake/sleep function however I have found it very inconsistent. My wife’s G2 is much more consistent, I would say hers works 95% of the time and this about 50% (to wake, to sleep is much more consistent). I sent an email to Alcatel and they claim they are aware of this issue and plan on addressing it in an update.- It is very light and easy to use with my “medium” sized guy hands.- Case selection is somewhat limited.- It works well with T-Mobile, I get LTE where I did with my Note II and have no issue with wifi, Bluetooth or GPS. I do miss the stock T-Mobile voicemail app (the play store one is buggy).- The camera is quick to focus and takes pretty good photos. Video is good as well. I consider it as good as the one I had on my Note II (I liked that camera).- I like that it is not cluttered with bloat wear. My T-Mobile branded phone was loaded with all kinds of app’s I could not remove. I think this lends to the phone’s efficient use of resources.- Battery life has been good so far, I get through a day. I am a bit apprehensive about the lack of a replaceable battery. I always like the idea of being able to replace/swap mine on my Note II.6/12/15 Update -- The lowest setting for volume for the notifications is way to loud. There are plenty of apps to ""boost"" volume but I can not find a good one for a work around here.- I have not been get 5ish hours of screen on time as many reviewers state. I usually get to about 4 with about 10% battery left. I am not a heavy gamer. Just email, reading web pages and texting. A smattering of clash of clans here and there."
"Alcatel",5,"What can I say?Great phone. Loud speakers, good camera, stock google lollipop!Great battery life!Bright screen, and processor barely shows its budget price.If you want a phone for 250, this is the best option for ya. Best all around phone at this price."
"Alcatel",3,"Great phone but it came with a couple of dead pixels right in the center of the screen. I've never run into dead pixels on a phone before. Returned and waiting for another."
"Alcatel",5,"This phone is a great phone that never seems to have a problem. It is very conformable in my hand. i have had it freeze 1 time but it was only for a couple of seconds and during a software update."
"Alcatel",5,"Quite a fantastic phone for a reasonable price!"
"Alcatel",3,"This phone was OK at best. The amount of lag in its build of android was pretty bad. Security patches hadn't been released for it since June of 2016. Luckily I only needed it to last me a month so I could replace it. Sadly, even at that requirement it took just the right spill on Halloween and the screen cracked. So much for making it a play phone for my son."
"Alcatel",5,"nice features"
"Alcatel",5,"Very good"
"Alcatel",1,"I purchased this phone only recently here on Amazon and paid $99 - but it is now listed @ $240. And so you might think I would be delighted that I got such a 'good' deal, right? WRONG. I am extremely disappointed with this phone, despite my previous research and finding many good reviews on it.I have an LG41C with no special bells and whistles, though it pretty much has everything I really need. But after almost two years, it's got a couple of glitches that can't be resolved so I thought I would ""upgrade"" to another brand and a larger size. What a mistake!This Alcatel takes 45 + seconds to start fully (my LG takes 20), it takes only adequate photos (my LG takes GREAT pics), the battery runs almost out after only a few hours of little to no usage and with power save on - plus I haven't even talked on this phone yet! (my LG runs hours longer and I occasionally talk on it), and this Alcatel takes HOURS to fully charge (my LG takes an hour at most and that's if it's under 10%). AND while it's charging (power off) it makes a low buzzing sound about every 15 seconds and there is NO way to stop it.In addtion to all that - I cannot open photos on messaging and despite confirming that all the settings are correct. I tried everything possible and then called Alcatel and was actually told that the messaging that is built into this phone is not the best and you can't receive MMS! What? My LG has always opened photos via its built-in messaging, as long as mobile data is enabled. So the Alcatel rep told me to use another messaging app in order to open photos. Unacceptable.And not only all that, it will NOT sound a notification upon receipt of text messages. Again, I have worked with all the appropriate settings (I'm not a novice) over and over and it simply will not work.Also, there are no emojis available on the keypad when you're using Instagram. Huh?I've no doubt there are multiple other problems with this phone that I've never even encountered yet - but in the two weeks that I've used it, these are quite enough problems.And now . . . this is the worst:In the past couple of days, this Alcatel gets VERY HOT during charging (my LG NEVER gets hot when charging, not even in the slightest) - and this heating issue alone is why I am going to send it back because I fear it is potentially dangerous. A phone simply should NOT get this hot while charging.Everyone has their own opinion and can make their own decision - but I would NOT recommend this phone to anyone and I am appalled that this $99 phone (not even worth that) is NOW listed at such a ridiculous price of $240."
"Alcatel",3,"Screen is not scratch resistant..used it for a month and already screen got numerous scratches.."
"Alcatel",5,"OK not the best not the worst"
"Alcatel",2,"Freezes often and loads apps very slowly."
"Alcatel",5,"This is an amazing phone for the price. We have two kids and want them both to have a phone for when they leave the house. They are also both huge gamers when allowed and this phone keeps up with them! The screen is beautiful and the sound is incredible. My daughter is a music lover so she's always streaming music from hers and I can hear it from all over the house when she has it turned up - with her door closed. I love that this phone offers everything a high end phone does for a fraction of the price. My husband actually is thinking of getting rid of his current phone to get one of these and he's a phone nerd. It comes with the phone, wall plug in and cable and some very nice jbl headphones that sound amazing! Cases and screen protectors are not hard to find for this phone which is nice. The last phone they had we couldn't find anything. I would recommend this phone to anyone looking for a great device at a low cost. Shipping was fast and it was packaged nice."
"Alcatel",1,"I wouldn't recommend this phone. Very poor battery life. Not very compatible with Ultra mobile. Lots of glitches. Should have known better just gonna stick with my nexus5 very fast and reliable. Don't waste your moneyon this phone."
"Alcatel",5,"This is a very good phone though there are things to improve.The dual front-facing stereo speakers are super awesome which is very hard to find on other phones. The display is very amazing as well.My idol 3 5.5' is extremely good when playing videos. I love watching movie trailers and YouTube videos on it.My standard of choosing smartphones:1. At least 2GB RAM, CPU really doesn't matter to me2. 1080p or higher display resolution3. Display is larger than 5.0 inches4. Dual frontal stereo speakers5. Good product quality6. At least a 3000mAh bettary7. Expandable storage or a 64GB storage with a reasonable price8. Quick charger availableWhat I don't like about my idol 3:1. The JBL earbuds are those deep in-ear type which I don't like at all. It feels very uncomfortable to me to put anything deep inside of my ears. I know those deep in-ear headphones are very popular right now, but I really don't like them. This is not a big issue since I have earbuds from Apple and Motorola and I usually use my AKG and Sony headbands to listen to music.2. There is a lag sometimes while using the phone. This is not a big problem except when playing music which really bothers me. I hope it is a software issue, but I didn't have that problem with my Moto X 2 Gen.Considering the price, idol 3 5.5' really is a very good choice!"
"Alcatel",1,"If you get this phone, be very very careful with it.I purchased this phone right when it came out in the U.S., pre-ordering it on Amazon. Overall, I found it to be a great deal. The screen and battery life were great, the processor snappy, and the camera good for the price range.Unfortunately, after 6 months, I pulled my Alcatel Idol 3 out of my pocket and the screen was cracked. It had not been struck by anything, as you can see from the photo below. The crack comes from the edge, and there is no physical damage there. When I called Alcatel and they told me the warranty does not cover 'physical damage' and that a cracked screen counts as 'physical damage' no matter what.Maybe my phone was defective an Alcatel simply didn't want to cover my warranty. Otherwise, I gotta say, ONLY BUY THIS PHONE IF YOU PLAN TO BE VERY GENTLE WITH IT!!! (I had mine in a protective case).I ended up with a Moto G 3. It isn't quite as good as the Alcatel Idol 3 as far as screen goes, but what is the use of a phone that is slightly better if it is liable to break and Alcatel won't cover it? It is not worth the $200+ dollar risk.Again, hopefully for others, my phone was just defective."
"Alcatel",5,"Awesome."
"Alcatel",1,"Touch screen stopped responding on the bottom 1/4 inch of the screen. This sucks as it is where all of the navigation buttons are. This phone is almost bran new, never dropped. Tried factory reset - no luck. Phone is now useless after 60 or so days."
"Alcatel",5,"Excelent!"
"Alcatel",5,"My daughter loved it."
"Alcatel",5,"Now, this is a nice phone. Nice, clear screen. At 5.5 inches, it is definitely larger than my previous Moto G 2013, so it took a little getting used to. Hands are small so not all that easy for one handed use with my case. Love the speakers up front. Makes watching my shows on Netfilx that much more enjoyable. The UI is a little laggy at times, but that is compared to almost stock android on the Moto G. Compared to a friend's Samsung with TouchWiz, I get just a few less hangs up. The camera works for me (again, coming from that Moto G), but I have used much better (that Note 4 cam, wow!). I am truly impressed and would recommend it easily."
"Alcatel",3,"It's a good for the price tag. I really liked the battery life and all other aspect. The screen design makes it difficult to recommend this phone. Thin phone + 5.5 display is prone to CRACK!!! My idol3 screen cracked in regular usage and I'm no longer able to use the phone."
"Alcatel",1,"I am never one to write negative reviews but if I could give this piece of garbage a negative star rating I would. Please do not trust any of these reviews people. This garbage phone cant even handle the snapchat app. It repeatedly crashed and restarted because it couldn't even process a snapchat video and the audio from any video recording is laughably bad. Returned this and got a refurbished G3 for cheaper which blows this phone AWAY IN EVERY POSSIBLE CATEGORY AND FUNCTIONALITY. STAY AWAY FROM THIS GARBAGE!!!!!!!!!"
"Alcatel",5,"Great phone, but only have had it for 2 weeks. No complaints, working great with whatever I throw at it. I like it a lot so far."
"Alcatel",4,"Great phone! Worth every penny!Update.....After having the phone six months, it stopped working randomly one day. I tried plugging it into a charger and the only thing it would do was power cycle itself continuously. I reached out to Alcatel via e mail to no avail.I decided to send one last e mail threatening a report to the Better Business Bureau and I magically received 4 e mails in response from4 different people. Huh.....Long story short, they paid to ship the phone back to them to get fixed and it turns out they couldn't, so they have me a new one at no cost.It took a bit but they made right in the end."
"Alcatel",1,"Good on paper only. Bad software and bad support. Do not buy this ""smart"" phone if you value listening to music.Initially google voice did not work. Then now bluetooth music stutters. Headphones music hiccups occasionally.Support for this phone is substandard. They will ask you to ship your phone and wait for a refurb or repaired phone for 2 weeks."
"Alcatel",5,"Great phone. Excellent relationship quality:price"
"Alcatel",5,"Love it best budget phone to have around"
"Alcatel",5,"Awesome phone great for a $250 phone"
"Alcatel",5,"Good phone. Speaker is made for R&B Though. Metalheads beware"
"Alcatel",5,"Wow just WOW"
"Alcatel",5,"I purchased this after reading great reviews and I couldn't be more satisfied for the price. This phone's sound is unbelievable, and the screen is every bit as good as my Galaxy S4. Very lightweight for the large size. Love that I can add/change memory card via a pop-out tray on the side. One potential drawback for heavy phone users is nonremovable batter, but great for average phone use, music, podcasts and video. Good camera with plenty of options, too. Unlike some lower-priced phones, has latest version of Lollipop."
"Alcatel",5,"The best audio, the most vivid colors, fast enough, altough average camera (i didn't expect much about this last point because of the comments i read before i bought it)."
"Alcatel",5,"Perfect out of the box. I like the little device that ejects the sim card. Great camera. All the best to offer in an Android phone."
"Alcatel",3,"the item i received was in good shape, but a fake earpod were provided inside the box. keep that in mind"
"Alcatel",3,"Let me first list the best things about this phone:- Excellent speakers and superb screen, it is a joy to watch music videos and movies on this phone- Lot of value for the money- Thin, really good looking phoneThe bad/not so good points:- Way too slippery and without gorilla glass I am sure my screen would have shattered with regular use, ended up buying a wallet case and now I have a bulky phone- Not the best processing power, I face occasional lags especially after Marshmallow update. I wouldn't have mentioned this as a negative point considering the phone price point but I have a Blu phone that cost less than this phone and that phone is much faster.In short if you are looking for a phone with good stereo speakers and nice display but don't mind putting a screen protector and a bulky case for the phone, this would be a good fit. But if you are looking to use the phone without any protective case then this may not be the right phone since I am pretty sure the phone screen will break with regular use."
"Alcatel",3,"I've had this phone for a couple of days now; I wanted something with a bigger screen, but without having to spend the eight or nine hundred bucks it would have cost to stay in the iPhone family. My overall cost for this phone and a 64 GB microSD card was about 1/4 the cost of an iPhone 6S Plus.Getting the phone set up was mostly simple—I checked for and installed the Android system updates while charging the phone, then put in the microSD and SIM cards. (The SIM card was kind of a pain, since an adapter was necessary, but once I discovered that the adapter I ordered did include a thin strip of tape to make sure the SIM card doesn't fall out (which was not mentioned anywhere on the package), all went smoothly.)The parts I like, so far:• the expandable storage/memory. I may replace the 64 GB card with a 128 GB card at some point, but it'll be more than enough for now. I'm just happy to no longer be limited to the phone's built-in storage.• the large screen and full HD (1080 x 1920) resolution. Text is very readable, even at the ""normal"" setting, and there's plenty of room for whatever I'm looking at. Images generally look sharp and smooth, without jagginess.• the ""double tap"" feature. Double tap to wake the phone, then double tap to put it to sleep again. Very convenient—especially given the phone's reversible feature. Caveat: it does not work with the lock screen. In that instance, the power button has to be used to put the phone back to sleep.• the reversible feature. I'm surprised more phones don't do this. When the feature is enabled, the display orients itself to the way you are holding the phone. Not only that, but the earpiece and microphones switch as well, so the phone is always right side up, even when holding it upside down.• the battery life. So far, the battery life seems very good. The phone did charge a little bit between the time I transferred some photos to my computer and the time I unplugged the USB cable; otherwise, the battery is currently at 39% since its first full charge two nights ago.• the ""sweep"" feature (or whatever it is called), which enables you to close all open apps at once. Very convenient.• the phone is light. Despite being significantly larger than my old iPhone 5 (the display on this phone by itself is bigger than the iPhone 5 in a case), the Idol 3 is lighter than the iPhone 5. I don't think it's a huge difference, but it's definitely enough to notice.• the stereo speakers. The speakers sound good—and they sound just as good whether the phone is facing up or down (even in the simple case I bought for it).• the unlocked phone is upgradable to Marshmallow 6.0.1. (My carrier offers the Idol 3, but there's no indication of the Marshmallow upgrade being available from them anytime soon. Otherwise, I would have gone through them.)There are a couple of things I'm not so keen on at the moment:• the placement of the buttons. Though on opposite sides, the power and volume buttons are placed at about the same level; I have already taken several inadvertent screenshots while trying to put the phone to sleep from the lock screen.• the camera. It may be a matter of getting used to it, but the camera does not appear to live up to the quality of the display. Colors seem a bit washed out, especially with the front camera. Also, the front camera offers only automatic exposure, whereas the back camera offers full manual. UPDATE (8/20/16): The manual mode is useless. You can adjust ISO, shutter speed, and focus (!), but all you'll get is a black image—yup, no picture whatsoever. Only the automatic exposure mode will work. In addition, the panoramic mode does a poor job; you WILL end up with jagged edges at the least, and probably even sections where the image is not stitched together properly. In any event, in all but the best lighting conditions, your images will be noisy, with some blockiness apparent, and plenty of chroma noise. If you already have a phone that takes decent photos, you'll want to hang onto it; either that, or use a real camera.• if you use a PIN to unlock your phone, Android requires you to press a ""check"" key after the number. Not a huge deal, but iOS unlocks the phone as soon as you've pressed that last digit, so I sometimes forget, and the phone goes back to sleep.• unlike the iPhone, this phone doesn't read the SIM card until after the rather lengthy splash screen animation has finished. So, whereas the iPhone will show the name of the carrier and signal strength as soon as you've unlocked the phone, the Idol 3 shows ""No SIM Card"", and then ""No SIM Card – [carrier]"" before the name of the carrier appears. This always gives me pause, particularly since I have a nano SIM and had to use an adapter. Also unlike the iPhone, the display does not show the name of the carrier all the time—but that can be easily verified in the Quick Setting panel. (I mean, I know who my carrier is; I just like to know that the telephony function of the phone is working properly.)As for the quality of phone calls, I haven't used it long enough, but the first call I made sounded okay. At this point, I would probably give the iPhone a slight edge in sound quality.I haven't tried the earbuds yet, but then I rarely use my phone to listen to music, so this isn't much of a concern for me.(A note about the packaging: because they've hidden it under the lid covering the compartments of the box that contain the USB cable, charger, and earbuds, the tool used to open the card holder is very easy to miss. I had already used the one that came with the SIM card adapter I bought at the same time as the phone when I finally noticed it was there.)Apart from a few hiccups that go with getting used to a new OS, I am liking the Idol 3 so far. It's a light phone with a great display, good sound, and good battery life, and I didn't have to spend an exorbitant amount of money to get it."
"Alcatel",5,"Phone came on time. The package was not damaged what-so-ever. The phone is an remarkable. The design is elegant, the hardware can manage and overcome everything that the phone has to offer (Android Marshmallow running as smooth as on a flagship). The Screen is bright and pretty - all colors stand out and the HD display proves its amazing.Under $200, this is an amazing smartphone, and one would expect it to cost at least under $400. No problems yet, I have been using it for a week, and the phone performs well over 5 stars!"
"Alcatel",4,"the phone is good, it updated to android 6 as soon as i activated it with my carrier. the only downside is the camera which is kinda crappy."
"Alcatel",5,"I cannot compare this Smartphone to any other product because this is the only smart phone I've ever had.I bought it a year ago because it was unlocked and I could use my Tracfone Account and because of its many features so that I could use it for virtual reality, gaming and 4G LTE phone.I am writing this review after year of owning this phone and I have to say I am still totally happy with it. I have to stifle the impulse to say I am amazed at the quality and usefulness of this device.I bought it with Android 5.0 1 and recently it updated - 6.01. I didn't know it would do that! It was a bonus.My only problem is the 16 gigabytes. The Android operating system does not use the SD card efficiently, and so I had problems with filling your memory with too many apps and data. This is not a problem with the phone but more a problem with the operating system. Although if the phone has more memory that would have been a solution for me.This phone has been a joy for me and I would recommend to anyone!"
"Alcatel",4,"Love it it's amazing the only negative so far is if you try and do too much at once it will freeze but that's expected"
"Alcatel",4,"Didn't get my SIM removal tool but used an earring. Other than that it's a great phone."
"Alcatel",5,"Solid phone after 24 hours. It gets the job done with no software hiccups. It looks better in hand than in photos."
"Alcatel",5,"awesome phone. better than i expected. great screen. great speakers and headphones"
"Alcatel",5,"I says to myself, if I spend $600 plus for a phone, I would always worry about dropping it, leaving it somewhere, spilling coffee on it, etc. For $249.00 bucks I got a beautiful bright high quality screen, very good stereo speakers, great build quality,a reversible display,a decent camera, great battery life, Android 5.0.2 and expandable memory! I mean we talking $249.00 bucks! What is the logic in listening to speakers on the back or side of a phone? Who in their right mind would even consider saying anything negative about spending $249.00 bucks for a phone that does more than 90% of the phones on the market for less than half the price! Still hard to believe I got all this for $249.00 bucks! Watching videos with the stereo speakers is the main feature that sets this phone apart from the rest of the phones on the market. Best purchase I every made!"
"Alcatel",5,"Great phone for price. Alcatel surprised me"
"Alcatel",5,"Had this phone for one week. It is amazing. But please understand this is my first smart phone, but I've been studying them for years. I just could not accept the usual contract and fees. Ugh. I'm glad I waited. Great price. Fabulous GSM service. Allowed me to walk into ATT store, get a free SIM card and $45.00 a month, unlimited text and talk, 1.5GB data. Plenty for me. Added a 64 GB SD card. Phone now has 80GB of storage. And despite what some have said, the processor never bogged down for all the things I am doing. I call it the poor man's iPhone 6+. And the screen is as bright as any 700.00 dollar phone. I'd recommend it."
"Alcatel",5,"Love the new phone. The camera is great!"
"Alcatel",5,"Bought this phone for my wife and she loves it."
"Alcatel",1,"Do not buy this phone unless you want a phone that last 3 months the glue they used to attach the screen has weared off in 3 months so the screen is litlery pealing off my phone at this moment do not buy"
"Alcatel",5,"I can never seem to settle on a phone. I splurge on the latest new device, only to regret it for some reason or another. Sold my Moto G because the camera was terrible, sold my Note 4 because I think having a $700 phone is ridiculous.Wanted LTE band 12 (T-Mobile is building out their network coverage in rural areas especially with this frequency not supported yet by many phones), a big screen, dual band WiFi, and a price under $300.Initially passed over this phone and Alcatel altogether because it seemed like a very low end brand. This device has changed my opinion of the company. I also looked at the zte zmax and huawei p8 lite, but this Idol 3 seemed to be the best combination of affordability and features.Very customizable and near stock Android lollipop. Great screen, great speakers, decent build quality, decent main camera (seems about as good as my old S4 which was fine), above average front facing camera. Too bad it doesnt have a replaceable battery, but not a huge deal. Doesnt seem like an octa core processor, lagging at times, although not enough to annoy.I usually install custom software on my phones, but after using this phone for a while, turning off double tap to wake, and uninstalling almost all of the preinstalled apps, I like it the way it is.Because it was cheap for a smartphone, I won't be devastated if it gets dropped or cracked. Turn off double tap to wake, uninstall unwanted apps, install a different launcher if you want, install Google keyboard, be careful installing the sim card, dont expect it to behave like a $700 Note 4, and enjoy!"
"Alcatel",4,"For the money I think this is a pretty good phone. Screen is clear but not as good as I expected. Battery life is good. Speakers are very good and surprisingly loud and clear if needed. The one thing that really bugged me was the call quality. Not sure how I sounded to others but on my end voice quality sounded hollow and tinny and whatever I was listening to kept fading in and out. Pretty sure it was the phone because my cheaper back-up phone doesn't have those issues. I eventually decided to return the phone for a refund. I think a better choice, in the same price range, would be the Huawei Ascend Mate 2. Bigger screen and killer battery life. For something cheaper go with BLU."
"Alcatel",5,"I have been using this phone for over a month now. This phone is not a crap filled phone. It is perfect. Battery last long time. Screen is crisp and bright. Does not feel like a cheap phone in the hand. Front dual speakers are excellent and the JBL headphones are a super bonus. Phone is very responsive. My only negative issue is the tap on tap off feature that is a little quirky, but turn this feature off and its a great phone for a great price!!!"
"Alcatel",3,"I had for a couple of weeks with no problem. but then one day the just stop working it wont even let get into the homepage. I had to return it back. this that bs."
"Alcatel",1,"If you read through these reviews, you will notice that most are from people who have just purchased the phone. At first flush, the OneTouch Idol 3 is an amazing phone. It's a beautiful phone, and it's internal components are first-rate. I never had better speeds on the T-Mobile network. It seems like a great phone, and the price cannot be beat for what you get.However, this is a one star review for a reason. The phone has one dramatic flaw is only noticeable after a few months of ownership. And it's a flaw that renders the phone unusable. To keep the price down, Alcatel did not use Gorilla Glass for the big and beautiful screen. It's probably how they kept the price of this phone so low. This and this alone is a reason to look elsewhere for your next phone. All it takes is a small drop or accidentally sitting on the phone to crack the glass. And it doesn't just crack, it shatters like a window pane.The glass will shatter even if you have the phone in a hard case, which is what happened to me (twice, with two different phones). Sadly, this is a known issue and Alcatel will not replace your phone, even under warranty."
"Alcatel",4,"Not bad given the price .. But if u r coming from a high end device to this .. U will surely feel the performance hit .. This phones performance is very sluggish .."
"Alcatel",5,"Great device ... It's better than I expected !!!Great performance at low price ... u won't get that ultra mega performance like new flagships .. But u will get %80 of their performance at a fraction of their price !! It's a good deal :)"
"Alcatel",1,"Software and screen were lovely until the phone started to not display anything but colored lines. I wanted to like this phone and am really annoyed it broke within 48 hrs. No drops no wetness. I would get a replacement but I'm not a believer in the brand anymore"
"Alcatel",2,"Sending it back. Would not boot into Android after downloading the update that I was prompted to do."
"Alcatel",5,"Great display and sound, beautiful look"
"Alcatel",5,"This phone is great! I hadn't had any real problems out of it except for when it did not wake up at one time. I tapped, I pressed the power button and I even called it, mind you this was after the most recent update. I ended up having to do a hard reset on it, so far no further problems. The only thing that I don't like is that you don't have access to emojis on social media but other than its a very good phone definitely worth $250 bucks.UPDATE!!!!!!!Well I have had this phone for a while now and I loved it, the only problems Ive had with this phone are ones that Ive caused myself, as far as the phone messing up on its own, no problems. The worst thing about this phone is the screen is not durable at all, one tap against a chair and it cracks and the screen does not work, cant unlock it, cant do anything, my galaxy s3 is way more durable than this. I recommend getting a tempered glass protector for it and the most durable case you can, but generally as long as you have the tempered glass you can just about use any case you would like. Ive searched all over for a phone that might compare to this, tired of Samsung products and their UI and notification sounds, to poor for anything else that I might genuinely like, ran across the HONOR 5X but it doesnt have a reversible interface and it hasnt been released yet, I'm not patient enough to wait a couple months for reviews so I figure I will just order this again, Win WIn."
"Alcatel",5,"love it."
"Alcatel",4,"Great performance, never run into any lagging. Nice and thin and fits well in my pocket (I was used to a 4"" phone!). Great screen and battery life. Dropped one star because the camera isn't all that great, particularly in low light."
"Alcatel",5,"Amazing Phone at a very affordable price. Highly recommend!"
"Alcatel",5,"A great Android phone. A quality purchase at a very good price."
"Alcatel",3,"I'm just giving 3 stars for now as I still don't know if the phone works good or not.The phone arrived on time but when I put in my Metro PCS SIM card it won't recognize it.I checked on the website and it clearly states that phone is compatible with AT&T,T-Mobile,Metro PCS and most GSM carriers.I will go to the Metro PCS store tomorrow to see if there's a way get it to work.UPDATED REVIEW!!!!!,I went to Metro PCS to get a newer SIM card and this time it worked,had to pay an extra $15 but the phone is running and is working properly.I think the price is ok for a phone like this.The phone is thin and it looks like is well constructed,the only weird thing is that the power button is on the upper left side but I can live with that.The screen isn't too bright but I can also live with that and for a phone with a 5.5 screen is not bulky or too big,I just love the size and I'm happy with my phone.WELL I'M GIVING THE PHONE 4 STARS!!!!!!"
"Alcatel",5,"Feels like my m7 just a tiny bit slower, but with all the same features and better camera."
"Alcatel",3,"It's a great phone with annoying issues.What I like about the phone:Has the best display on a budget phone and can go head to head with any flagship phone.Has great speakers and audio experience. This phone sounds better than a lot of the flagships out there. The speaker and headset port produce some great sound. This phone easily competes with all the flagships in the audio category and beats if not all than most.GPS, alcatel got it right, it's so hard to find an android phone with flawless gps performance. This phone locks on in quickly and is pretty accurate, the moto g is pretty good in this regard as well. My galaxy s6 ($600 phone) has issues with gps performance.Battery: You can easily make it through the day again this beats my s6 but not as good as a note 4. For the price it beats a lot of flagships in the battery category.What I don't like (mostly software issues)Cell reception: It's worse than my old galaxy s4, s6, and note. I can easily get lte on my other phones and this phone barely gets HDSPA. Sometimes drops to edge. The download speed is slower. But what annoys me the most is when I'm in a good area and the phone sticks on hdspa and doesn't switch to lte. I noticed that this happens much more often when my radio is set to lte/wcdma/gsm more than lte/wcdma. So I have to manually switch it by going into the test settings through dial codes.Brightness: For some reason randomly the phone will dim all the way randomly, even with auto brightness turned off, me being outside, and the display set to full brightness. Which can make following directions or reading something outside very annoying.Background audio: Sometimes when I watched a youtube video put it on pause and turned off the display. Get a notification and the youtube video starts playing with the screen still off. It's annoying, and another software bug. Youtube isn't the only application to do this, for me most applications do this.Double tap: Turn it off, too many butt dials with the feature turned on.So great hardware, but there are some software issues, I'm checking for updates every day. I really want to keep this device. But my old cheaper moto g didn't have any of these issues. I think alcatel has a great device but for some reason way too many software bugs that needed to be ironed out before launch."
"Alcatel",3,"I just got a Alcatel Idol 3 It didn't bring the sd card remover call Amazon they overnighted me new phone..Great job on Amazon's behalf..Now the phone doesn't play all kinds of music files as other cell phones in its catagory you would have to find or buy some program to change files to play your music. I found it to be slow,on ATT and the tap to wake doesn't work all the time sometime when you make a long distance call and try to hit speaker phone the phone goes black or you loss the call. I will try to keep several more days to see if an update is going to solve some of the issues if not Iam going back to the LG G4. I realize that you get what you pay for but not at the risk of losing calls from fam. I have tried the sam s5,Htc M one 9, Micro's 618 windows and and so far the LG G4 is the best even though speaker is not that great everthing else is.."
"Alcatel",4,"The first one I got I had to send back because the LED notifications light was stuck on, even when I turn it off in the settings. Amazon sent a replacement, so all is well. I really like this phone. It operates fast enough to where I don't notice any delay, I really like the display, and I really like the minimum changes that they made to Android. I have had a few other phones in the last couple years, and I always prefer stock Android to other heavily modded UIs. I don't know why other companies think they can improve on something I am sure Google spent a lot of time developing...Pros- UI- The reversible speaker and home screen. I prefer having the headphone jack at the bottom when listening to music.- ScreenCons- My only complaint is that the double tap on feature doesn't work consistently. I think this has to do with the lock screen being engaged or not, or possibly how long the device has been asleep. I hope they fix it in the next few"
"Alcatel",5,"phone is great, and awesome bang for the buck. i knew the camera wasn't great from reading reviews, but in actuality it is worse than i thought. very grainy in anything but full sunlight and even then the auto focus works about 1 out of 5 times. video shooting is a little better. if you plan on taking a lot of photos pass on the phone, otherwise it's a great phone.oh, plan on taking a lot of screen shots. volume down + power = screen shot, and when trying to turn the screen off with one hand using the power button, the volume button is placed perfectly to end up taking a screen shot!UPDATE: Alcatel really supports this phone, they have done 3 software updates so far, and the camera is now performing much better. Vary happy that they are putting in effort to support the handset"
"Alcatel",2,"First cell I got and the two-tap on/off feature didn't work. I bought new one and am returning that defective one for refund. Are the boxes supposed to be sealed with plastic wrap because the second phone I got wasn't wrapped in plastic,... Forgot if the first one was. Great speaker and screen. I first bought an Asus zenfone 2 but returned that because the speaker and screen were incredibly bad. Idol 3 totally beats in those respects. Will update over time.Update 7-11-15.I returned first idol 3 and got replacement because double tap didn't work. And now on the replacement, double tap still barely works. It taps off but doesn't always tap back on. This is the reason i returned the first phone. I can't be only one having this issue. Other than that, good phone for now.***update 9-13-15***After months of use, I'm returning for galaxy s4. Thanks amazon for letting me. The idol, as much as I wanted to like and keep, is too slow and laggy and is sometimes unresponsive. Double tap on and off decides on its own when it wants to work, I hit call button twice sometimes because it doesn't respond the first time I try and the swype to text on the phone doesn't work well; it's as if my finger gets caught up/stuck on the screen and it doesn't make the word or forms incorrect word.Its just too slow and unresponsive for me. When I clear the screens with button on bottom right, the slowness shows as the framerate is horribly choppy. Plus the battery is built in. My new s4 has a removeable battery.The things I liked were speakers in front and screen, but the slowness and unresponsive nature of device made me switch."
"Alcatel",5,"It is great!!!"
"Alcatel",3,"The phone is really good although the phone battery really sucks if you are heavy user like me. But if you don't play games it's good it will last for a day. The phone is a little bit slippery so I suggest get a case. The camera is good as long you don't have shakey hands. Try to download a better camera app. Or edit your pics for improvement of the color. Watching videos and listen to music is really great. The only thing I don't like it takes too much time to charge. But besides that I can say it's a great phone. But don't expect too much. But still it's one of the best phone in this price range."
"Alcatel",5,"Second one for the family cheap and reasonable."
"Alcatel",4,"I just started using the phone this afternoon. When I picked up the phone, it felt surprisingly light, and my first thought was that it felt cheap. However, the phone looks actually pretty elegant and unassuming. So far I haven't had any problem with it yet."
"Alcatel",5,"I sent these phones to Ghana where I am told they work are working very well indeed."
"Alcatel",5,"Great phone, no issues"
"Alcatel",1,"This phone worked fantastic for about 6 months. Now it's constantly having issues functioning and seems to be progressively getting worse. Little to no updates from the company. Sorry but I definitely won't ever purchase another phone made my this company."
"Alcatel",5,"A great phone for the money. If you don't have to have the latest and greatest then check this phone out. Only missing 3gb(it has 2) ram as compared to other top flight phones."
"Alcatel",5,"So far, a great phone. I did a lot of research when deciding on a new phone in this price range. I listen to a lot of music on the run and the tipping point in favor of the Idol 3, for me, was the front facing stereo speakers.I've had the phone for a few days now, and I'm very impressed with it. The user interface is pretty much stock Lollipop, which I really appreciate. There is very little bloatware/shovelware taking up memory and what there is can be easily removed. The camera is average and takes decent pictures under the right conditions. Bluetooth paired up with all my devices, even the more finicky devices that have given me fits in the past. Call quality is really good and the voices are clear on both ends. Signal reception has been the same as my old phone and I have had no issues connecting to the network. WIFI connections are as expected and I have had no issues.I dropped in a 128Gb micro SD card and it is working as expected. I haven't had a chance to test out the NFC connection, but It's nice to have this capability.The real shocker is the sound quality. The front facing stereo speakers are really impressive. They are loud and you can crank it up with no distortion. Everyone I've demo'ed this for has had the same reaction, ""Whoa, that is impressive"". Are you going to replace your home sound system? Of course not, But you get some pretty big sound from some pretty small speakers. The other surprise was from the included ear buds. I wasn't expecting much, but they sound pretty good for being included in the box. They have flat, no tangle cables and include different size ear pieces. They are a little flat sounding in the mid range, but not objectionably so. They won't replace my more expensive ear buds, but if these were the only ones I had, I'm not sure I would be that quick to replace them. I definitely won't be throwing these out.All in all I am very happy with this phone. It has great features and the sounds is incredible. On top of all that it functions well as a phone. In my opinion, this is a good value for the money."
"Alcatel",3,"I""m giving this phone a 3 because there seems to be (for me) a fundamental flaw in the ergonomics of the phone. The way the switches are set up they are never in the right place. Also, I seem to be constantly grabbing the phone and hitting the switches at the same time, which seems to try and shut the phone down, or take a screenshot of the phone, neither of which I like. It took me a while to figure out that when I was trying to shoot a photo I was gripping the phone in a manner that I hit the buttons and it kept shutting down.I've had similar android phones and never had this issue.The icons are cartoon-y (I put an icon pack in to create shortcuts so I didn't have to look at them) and the phone seems rather slow to respond (for example, when you change screens or shut down the open apps). The phone seems to work ok, when I'm not having trouble manipulating it, and the setup was relatively simple and straightforward (coming from another unlocked android).I would not buy the phone again, but will keep it for now as I don't want the hassle of getting another phone. My old one stopped working so this purchase, while researched, was made a bit more quickly than I might of liked."
"Alcatel",5,"I'm very pleased with the product, It met my expectations."
"Alcatel",5,"This is a good phone for under 300 dollars.I would recommend this phone to anyone who don't want to spend a lot of money and want great performing phone.SG"
"Alcatel",3,"Had both ASUS ZenPone 2 and ALCATEL IDOL 3 for two of my family members. Both phones look great. Both handle 4g LTE well.Side by side comparison of the two:1) the IDOL3 got better and more premium sound for enjoying the movies/games than ZenPone 2.2) However, ZenPhone 2 got much faster responses in all apps comparing to IDOL 3. If you need to do multitasking and use business apps, I will choose ZenPhone 2, but not IDOL 3.3) Regarding the talk quality, ZenPhone 2 is better than IDOL 3!4) ZenPhone 2 is heavier than IDOL 3 and solidly build. In contrast, IDOL 3 is much lighter and more like a jewelry and prone to break.Both are good phones.Personally, I favor ASUS ZenPhone 2 than IDOL3 for its Two Sim capability/Faster responses/Easily handling the multitasking for my daily business usage. However, if you only need a phone for entrainment, than IDOL 3 is a better choice than ZenPhone 2 for its much better speaker sounds (but not for the talking quality). As a T mobile user in both phones, I found Zenfone 2 had a better talking quality than IDOL 3."
"Alcatel",4,"Live the phone. Good reception not much bloatware . sluggish occasionally. Performance is great when not multitasking a lot. Camera is good.looks great I put a green slick wrap on mine. I'm happy with mine I upgraded slightly from an huawei ascend mate 2 because I'm tired of jellybean. Great for listening to music."
"Alcatel",5,"I lucked out and was able to buy the Idol 3 for $199 shortly before midnight on Amazon’s Prime Day blow-out. I gotta say, Alcatel did an exceptional design job on the Idol 3. I believe it’s the best value smartphone on the market.Pros:- Superb screen. Easy to use in bright sunlight, which makes picture taking a breeze on a sunny day.- JBL sound, through both the speakers and the headset, is outstanding. The included JBL headphones are excellent with clear mids & highs and distortion-free tight bass.- The build quality on this phone is exceptional. Feels good in your hands, with no hint of cheapness, flimsiness, or low quality material Buttons presses are firm and manufacturing seams are aligned and tight. It’s also remarkably light and thin.- Before I got the phone I thought the reversible user interface (UI) was something that, although slick, I doubted I’d use very much. On the contrary, being able to reverse the UI comes in pretty handy and I use it quite a lot. For instance, sometimes it’s convenient to have headphones plugged into the top of the phone, and other times it’s better for me to have the cord coming out of the bottom (like on my dashboard car mount). With the reversible screen that’s not an issue.- I love the the double-tap feature. Super convenient, particularly in the car. However, it can occasionally be inconsistent. (see “Cons” below).- Volume & Power button placement: A lot of reviewers dislike the placement of the vol and power buttons because they’re located high on the phone’s sides. However, I actually prefer this button placement because: a) as I’m holding or carrying the phone, I’m not constantly hitting the buttons, and, b) in my car, it allows me to put the phone in my dashboard car mount such that the mount’s clamp is not pressing the buttons.- Call quality: Call quality is good. I hear no distortion or tinny-ness.- Overall processor performance: I’m not a big-time power user or gamer, so the Idol 3 performs reliably and predictably for me. Occasionally I do experience a slight stutter, but it’s so minor that it’s no big deal. Navigation around the UI is generally smooth and hiccup-free.- Camera: Picture quality stacks up nicely with other phones, some which cost a lot more. For all but the most demanding needs, the Idol 3 will deliver crisp, focused shots with good color balance. I have not used it much in low light, so I can’t comment on that aspect.- GPS locks on quickly, and Wi-Fi connects reliably.- Battery life: the Idol 3’s battery life is a dream compared to my old HTC Inspire, which I had to recharge throughout a typical workday. I’m easily getting thru my workday with charge to spare. The battery charges quickly too, due to the 2amp wall charger.Cons:- An occasional UI stutter, as mentioned above.- The volume sliders can only be set to 8 incremental, discrete intervals; I wish the volume sliders were continuously variable (like the brightness slider).- The Idol 3’s vibration mode is very weak. If the phone is set to vibrate mode and it’s laying on my desk, I often cannot detect when a vibrating call or text is coming in.- If you have the double-tap feature enabled, you sometimes have to repeatedly double-tap in order to wake the screen up, particularly when it’s been asleep for an extended period.- This is big phone and will take a bit of getting used to if you have smaller hands. Although, I must say it’s nicely balanced. I have med/large hands and didn’t find the Idol 3 particularly slippery or hard to grip.- The user manual is not very comprehensive. Tech support is located in Guadalajara, Mexico. I called tech support to address a few questions I had; the support I received was of average competence, … not terrible but not great.In Conclusion:The overall performance of the Idol 3 at the $249 price point is outstanding. It’s half the price of, say, an LG G4, and side-by-side, stacks up nicely. The phone does everything I ask of it and then some. Call quality is good, the speakers kick some serious butt, the screen resolution and brightness are superb, the camera works great for me, and battery life is excellent. Unless you just have to have top-tier specs, this is the best “bang for the buck” smartphone on the market."
"Alcatel",5,"Good"
"Alcatel",5,"Very much satisfied, I will give the seller more then 5 stars."
"Alcatel",5,"Excellent phone, poor documentation."
"Alcatel",5,"Awesome phone. Had to return it due to signal issues. I will probably buy it again after some updates get released."
"Alcatel",5,"After about a week of use, I have very little to complain about with this phone. The very bright and sharp display is easy to read in sunlight, the sound is as clear and loud as I've ever seen in a smartphone. Was worried that the 5.5"" screen would feel too big in my hand, but it actually fits well in my hand. The power button placement is a little high on the left side, but I've already gotten used to it. 4G LTE reception with Cricket Wireless has been solid, and I get a full day of battery life, even with a few hours of screen time. The phone feels thin and light but still feels solid. I'm still mastering the camera, finding that tapping the subject of your photo before taking does a great job of setting the proper exposure, especially in shots where there's something brighter than your subject elsewhere in the photo."
"Alcatel",4,"Amazing value. Great phone. Great reception. Excellent display. Good speakers. Updates are a bit flaky. First one messed up texting functionality and the third threw my phone into an endless reboot cycle. I ended up booting in safe mode, and eventually got the phone to boot again without having to wipe it. Sharing videos over email is still broken, which is very annoying. Maybe the next update will fix it. Only downside of this device is that it doesn't ship with stock Android, although it's pretty close (very few software enhancements and no bloatware)."
"Alcatel",5,"Beautiful, works great just advertised. Only problem was getting it set up by consumer cellular. It took four agents to finally get it right. Two agents and a supervisor told me it wouldn't work with their system. I'm so glad I persisted until I got a customer service rep that knew what to do. Great battery life. Since it is new I'll have to wait and seehow it works long term."
"Alcatel",2,"Sent back very laggy when using chrome"
"Alcatel",4,"excellent good phone all I would like to work more in the chamber for dark shots"
"Alcatel",1,"Pros:Speakers are loudest I've heardDisplay is bright and vividThe speed is pretty fast once you remove the minimal bloat, especially the antivirusVery lightweightBattery life was decentCons:Bad LTE receptionCamera wasn't very good, the flash is way too weak so low light is abysmalTap 2 wake is spotty, sometimes because it's slow to wake up. I'd rather just disable itUgly branding on the back. Sticker would solve thisNot many cases out thereOverall:I returned this thing. A phone that loses signal (0 bars!) between towers on the 405 freeway in LA? I'm not T-Mobile, and my cheap old LG F6 was a beast compared to this. My new LG G4 picks it up fine, too. I gave the Idol 3 a chance. Did Alcatel not even test this one bit in the field? What good is band 12 if I have trouble with band 4?!?!"
"Alcatel",4,"I'll admit it, I've got a phone problem. I tire of phones quickly and also get irritated by them. I've used nearly every flagship device on the market. This device keeps pace with any flagship that's a generation old and blows away mid range device it's designed to compete with.The camera is good, voice calls are good, display is excellent even in direct light, and it's responsive even when multi tasking.You may not like the fixed battery or the almost stock Android. Samsung, HTC, and LG all have ""skins"" that make for a nicer user experience.I will update my review with real battery life numbers. 2 days in the battery seems like plenty to get you through a day.Before you fork over $30 per month for the next 2 years, or worse yet sign a contract, give this phone a shot."
"Alcatel",4,"Great smart phone. Gets a bit sluggish from time to time, but I still like it. It's big, thin and the battery last all day. A bang for the buck!"
"Alcatel",5,"I have had the phone for a week now and here is my honest opinion. As you see, that I have given the phone 5 stars. This rating is for comparison to other phones in it's price range. I am not going to try and compare this phone with IPhone or Samsung. I have T-Mobile and I am on a no-contract employee plan that requires me to buy my phones outright. So price is a BIG deal. IMO the phone is great! Here are my honest thoughts:- Screen Size and looks is great! Very readable in the sun. Well above it's $250 price tag- The ONLY lag I ever experience is when I am sweeping running apps. And that is hardly a lag. It is very fluid and responsive.- No Dropped Calls- My LTE T-Mobile data has been 12.5 mbps- Front facings speakers are amazing and sound great. BUT they are louder than I want them to be at the lowest setting. I have Triplets Babies and when they are asleep, I can't have headphones in and the audio on the lowest setting is still too loud.- The Camera is Great! No issues or complaints.- The double tap to turn it on is unreliable and works less than 50% of the time. Double tapping to turn off works just fine.- BUT I am right handed and I have no issues with where the on/off button is. I don't know why others have complained.- I love the I can talk into either end of the phone. Especially when using the google search. It hears me every time!- The GPS is great and on-time! The front facing speakers were great to hear the turn by turn directions.- The head phones sound great!- The reversible setting is awesome and such a duh idea.- This may be an Android problem but is really annoying… but any group messaging that I have gets a date of Jan 17, 1970 and so they just sit at the bottom of my messages log. It’s VERY Annoying and I can’t figure out how to fix that. Anyone else have this problem?- Battery Life is about a day in a half. I use my phone mostly with Calls, Texts, Twitter, Facebook, Email, Camera, Internet. (Occasionally the GPS and Netflix, no gaming.)- In all, the phone is not ""perfect"". But just as close as it's going to be at this price. Definitely worth 5 stars and I recommend it every time!Now I just need a case. Not a bulky one. Any recommendations?"
"Alcatel",5,"At this price I think that Idole 3 can be considered one of the best smartphones on the market.It is a good device and very easy to handle.PRO: LTE frequencies working with AT&T and other US carriers, Android Lollipop, excellent and brilliant screen, very good cameras (front camera is 8 mp!), excellent stereo speakers, good battery.CON: processor MSM8939 is not fast: avoid multitasking! audio during calls could have a little more clarity."
"Alcatel",5,"Fantastic screen, good performance, good battery life. Overall: A+"
"Alcatel",4,"yes but I wish it was a 2k or 4k screen and the speakers was a little louder but other than that I love the phone for the price $249can't beat that or less it was $199but is OK"
"Alcatel",5,"Pluses:Price: about $100 (can't believe this much phone for the money)Display: 1080P while it's not AMOLED, really pretty for the $Sound: stereo speakers rock. Easily the best sound I've ever heard from a phone. While it's not loud enough for a large party, it is great for at home listening.Camera: 13MP camera takes good pictures. Low light is not excellent but, again, for the price, very nice.Expandable memory: Has a double slot for Sim and micro SD card. Even my Moto X didn't do that.Battery: Makes it through the whole day with moderately heavy use. You can kill it if you try hard enough but I usually have half a charge left after a long day.Minuses: There appears to be no way to stop ""full battery"" notifications. If you have it by your bed at night, it is annoying to be notified of a full battery at 3AM.Speed: While adequate, there is some lag with multiple applications open. To me, just mildly irritating but this might be a deal breaker for power users."
"Alcatel",5,"Luv luv luv my phone"
"Alcatel",5,"Using at&t go phone sim...operates 6.01 marshmellow ...more than enough phone. I', in the boonies and gets reception."
"Alcatel",4,"The screen is very bright and sharp but not as colorful as a Super AMOLED screen. The speakers are very loud and clear. compared to others. There is processor lag when overloaded with tasks. I don't mind not having a fingerprint sensor because this is a mid range phone after all. Camera is pretty good. I prefer polished aluminum but the design of this plastic phone is very beautiful. Good durability in my opinion when properly cased AND screen protected of coarse. Has survived many drops from my kiddos. The user interface is almost stock Android, very easy to navigate. This is a perfect starter phone for a younger adolescent,older adult or daily user on the go."
"Alcatel",5,"Great phone, great price. I shopped around for a budget-priced phone with up to date specs. I spent days on this, and decided on this phone because it was $100 less than I was willing to spend but it still had everything I needed. My only concern at purchase was I thought battery life would be an issue coming off a phone with a 5000 MaH battery I had with the BLU Studio Energy 2. What I do is go into settings and turn on battery saver immediately after taking the phone off the charger. That way I get about 18 hours of fairly active use, calling, texting, streaming video, listening to audio. Then I put on charger and am ready for the next day. It has a 2950 MaH battery but lasts more like a 4000 MaH one on battery saver mode. Phone is super fast with octa-core processor, even running on battery saver - I can't really tell the difference in performance, but it's limiting the background processes that drain the juice out of most phones. Phone ships with Android 5.1, but it quickly upgrades to the newer Android Marshmallow 6.0 software upon initial bootup. Also, phone has an 8MP selfie camera, 5MP is standard on many phones which is ice. The front camera is decent at 13MP, on par with a Samsung S6. Nice display and beautiful video. At 5.5"" it's the right size and the build quality is impressive. Good sound from the JBL twin speakers, you can actually hear. Call quality seems to be good (I'm on Cricket), and the speakerphone comes in loud and clear. It even comes with NFC built-in if that's important to you. Overall, it's a 5-star phone at a 3-star price point and it has my highest recommendation."
"Alcatel",5,"Phone came in perfect conditions, fast shipping, it's a game changer, best phone for his price, specs, screen, batery.Just one thign it's that lag in his original Android 5.0, update after purchased to marshmallow y voila u have a awesome flashkiller"
"Alcatel",5,"This is the cheapest phone I've ever bought and one of the best I've ever had. Having used it constantly everyday for almost a month now I knew I had to review it.Let's start with the physical: The phone is thin with a sleek design comparable to some flagships out there. It is ultra lightweight to the point that I don't feel it in my purse; sometimes I actually rummage through my bag to make sure it's still there. The screen is big and pictures are clear and crisp. Same sound-wise, I haven't had any dropped calls or had people on the other end telling me they can't hear me so it's definitely a jump up from my last android which was more than double the price.Now the technical: To start with I purchased a 32gb SDHC card to take advantage of the expandable storage so I didn't have to skimp out on any apps I used, and as a long time T-Mobile customer I was able to get the SIM card for free. I immediately put the cards in and voila I had a working phone. [Disclaimer: There are no features from T-Mobile that I do not have access to, unless there are features out there that I am not aware of].So the important stuff, I am in love with the eye scanner (HOW COOL IS THAT) which can be used as a lock screen mechanism. It makes me feel like a secret spy agent! Unlike fingerprint readers which seem outdated now, I'm able to impress my friends and family with an eye scanner. I also very much enjoy the camera which pulls up with two presses of the power button, it beats tapping on a screen that isn't always responsive in a moment's notice. I can capture vital images quickly and accurately in a moving vehicle or when I'm at a concert, which is simply awesome especially for the price tag. Lastly, the fast charging nature of this phone puts me in awe. I use the phone for hours on end and yes the battery drains like a normal phone does, but then all I have to do is plug it in and my phone gets charged in no time! I can also keep playing my games, video chatting and having multiple apps and webpages open with no lag and without pausing to let the phone charge, and a regular car charger gets my phone charged even when I have Waze or Google Maps on.Overall I highly recommend this phone, if it somehow died I would buy another one without hesitation. This phone is comparable to flagships in terms of design and basic features one looks for in a phone. And for the price it truly is unbeatable without being inferior."
"Alcatel",5,"good"
"Alcatel",5,"Surprisingly good quality phone considering the low price compared to other phones. Have had it for over a week and dropped it twice and did not break or scratch. Has a decent amount of space with options to upgrade. Able to play all my games without any lag and plenty of room on the screen to see everything."
"Alcatel",5,"Quality is amazing for the price .. Audio is nice, camera quality is pretty decent, charges very quickly and lasts for the day.. Well (It depends on how much you use it.) But to be honest, this is by far the best 100 bucks I've ever spent 😁Advise: Get a screen protecter, preferably glass and you're fine."
"Alcatel",5,"I am an iPhone freak. I was looking to add another phone(a moderately priced one as it'll only serve as my iPhone's 'assistant') with a different OS from apple's iOS. A phone with the android OS was my preferred choice. I gave up on my search because I didn't get what I needed in a moderately priced android phone till I saw a friend with the 4.7 inch version of the idol 3. I browsed through and was like 'whaaat, Alcatel did this'? The phone fast, has a good camera, has good speakers and good battery life, because after about 30 minutes of watching videos, the battery didn't drain as it would've on my iPhone 6. I bought one of the 4.7 for my personal use due to its cute size and 4 of the 5.5 to sell. In my country, bigger screen phones sells faster, plus the 5.5 is the better of the two in terms of performance. It's been about a year now and none of the buyers has called to complain about anything. A special someone needs an android OS phone and the only phone that came to mind was the idol 3, my reason for buying again. We had an issue before I received the phone. I am waiting till the issue is resolved before presenting the phone. She'll love it(because she's always praised mine every time she's played with it), and even more because this screen size bigger than mine."
"Alcatel",1,"haven't ever experienced terrible phone like this.it does not touch well. I have to click more than one time.one day i found that all the app data gone. I had to log in all the apps, and change the settings in each app.it works slow just like snapdragon 400 series"
"Alcatel",5,"I was really surprised on how well it works"
"Alcatel",4,"I hate smartphones. Only the need for an unlocked device persuaded me to sup with the devil. I long for a simple flip-phone. OK this phartsmone seems to be very acceptable. Once I figured out how to answer a phone call I was very happy. What I cannot shake is the feeling that all these icon things are sucking my PAYG airtime into a black hole. So I keep it turned off - that defeats the gremlins! Should you buy this phone? I'd say it does the job that you would expect of a more expensive unit and it's worth the money. I transitioned from the USA to South Africa and it's fine. I'm not fond of micro-sims for SA because the USB modems for my laptop take full size sims and I don't want to access the internet from a phone, dammit. I hate it. But you'll like it because you are not old and crotchety like me."
"Alcatel",5,"Fast shipping,good phone"
"Alcatel",5,"Mobile is excellent and I bought it for my wife and she liked it a lot.."
"Alcatel",4,"Is an acceptable phone considering it costs about 140 dollarsOctacoreNice speakers (JBL)Acceptable screen.Android 6I havethis phone about a month, and restart only once. I don't know what will happen in the future, but is enough phone for me."
"Alcatel",1,"This phone failed 34 days after my order. I have no recourse to return based on the 30 day policy. There is not even a clear ability to communicate to Amazon about this.This is an unfortunate customer service issueWould not purchase again"
"Alcatel",5,"Marvelous screen, camera, speaker sound."
"Alcatel",4,"I have been using it for only a couple of weeks and it is working quite nicely. A great improvement from my previous Alcatel phone. I only wish there were a phone with the same specifications in a smaller size, like a 5"" or less. I was torn between this one and the ALCATEL OneTouch Idol 3 Global Unlocked 4G LTE Smartphone, 4.7 HD. However, this one is much better in all aspects except size. So, it is a compromise for me.If it weren't for that I would probably be closer to 5 stars."
"Alcatel",4,"Very good value for the price, couldn't for more for a $100 phone."
"Alcatel",2,"Bought for $132 phone design is horrible. SD and sim card slot breaks after taking it out one time. Go look at videos for installing a sim on this phone its a joke. The battery is not removable. The screen shows every finger mark. Its slow and the camera is not good either. The only thing good is that it has a full HD resolution (1080), and a large screen. The customer service for Alcatel is disgusting. The guy I was chatting to just simply ignored me, and when I tried to connect to someone who would help me it just kept redirecting me to the same guy. This phone is worth no more than $100. Overall disappointed."
"Alcatel",5,"Its a good Phone for the price, I am absolutly happy with it"
"Alcatel",1,"Asked for refund product not working"
"Alcatel",5,"What can you say, it is made in China and that means GOOD REAL GOOD to me.I have several others and they are all excellent.I travel to China on vacation and I use a China Mobile Simm, no problems. GREAT PHONE.Uses AT&T and is really 4G LTE and it works great and in China is also excellent!!!!!!!"
"Alcatel",5,"Love It"
"Alcatel",1,"if u have no ther option, then u better stay with no phone. Days 1 thru 3 were good. Then everything went downhill. The phone lags, it stutters, it freezes to the point where it begins to get hot and it locks up. The phone did feel ok in the hand. oh yeah and the speakers were good."
"Alcatel",5,"Can't beat this phone for the price! I replaced my Samsung Galaxy S5 and haven't looked back.My only complaint is the lack of removable battery, but luckily that hasn't been an issue yet."
"Alcatel",5,"Great deal for price. Thin, great battery life, sharp and bright screen. This not a low end phone as price would suggest. You can get half a dozen of these for the price of an Iphone. My wife has had one for a year with no issues so I replaced my Fire phone with one to get the larger screen. Fire phone still has the best interface. Wish Amazon had keep up development on it"
"Alcatel",5,"This is the second one I purchased, one for each parent. Since the price had dropped significantly it was a steal. At under $200 this phone is a solid buy. So far it's up to Marshmallow, and has a great screen, great performance, and amazing dual front facing speakers. Battery like is solid and the added benefit of expandable storage with a very stock interface (after adding the Google launcher) are an added bonus. The only issue with this phone is the camera. It's slow, and in medium to low light blurring does occur. I expect this from a phone at this price, but if you have decent light and steady hands you can take average photos."
"Alcatel",3,"Update December 30th, 2015:* I had to downgrade my rating to a 3 star because after 6 months of usage the phone is noticeably showing wear and tear of being a cheap phone. I had no illusion that the phone would be masterfully constructed at the price point. At this point I can feel that the phone creaks if bent a little bit, and I can see that my screen cover's glue has come off at one edge. To top this off the camera has failed me recently, and I'm in the process of submitting a warranty claim. If that goes well and this are better, then I'll consider bumping the star rating back up to 4 stars....Original Review follows, and all of these things are still true for me. I do really love what this phone got right, its just too bad its not constructed better...Here are a few thing that should make you want this phone:* The Camera app - Alcatel seems to have made their own camera app, and do not use the Android stock app (which if you want you could install from the app store). But this app I feel like is superior to the android one. It does virtually no hunting for focus, and takes photos immediately when you press the shutter button. I feel like this gives the camera a distinctly Apple Iphone feel to it, and have been pleasantly surprised. The Google Camera app does not function as smoothly, and am glad to have an alternative with the Alcatel. Others have commented on the actual camera photo quality itself, which I have not tested, but honestly for my use I'm glad that the app just functions fast.* The phone is pretty much stock android. I put the Google Now Launcher on my phone and the experience is almost exactly the same as my old Nexus 4. There are a few pre-loaded apps, but you can easily remove them. The ones that you can't remove are system apps like the android gallery, and the Mix application which is a music player. Both can be ignored for your applications of choice.With that said, other reviews have done a good job of describing the phone and its pros and cons. I just wanted to add the only reason I can't give it a 5, is that while it is awesome for the price, it still has its drawbacks. It does so many things great, and they got many features totally right. But after using it for 4 or 5 days, I begin to notice the areas where they had to cut corners to get it to the price it is at. These things have been mentioned in other reviews already. With that said. Its amazing how much they do for the price, but they haven't quite hidden the reasons you might want a more expensive phone, in my opinion. If you're already in the market for spending this much, instead of buying something much more expensive, then I can say you should definitely just buy it and try it out."
"Alcatel",5,"Nice smartphone"
"Alcatel",5,"for 250 this phone is pretty good i wanted to buy an unlocked phone that i can use with any gsm carrier i feel i made the right choice with this, coming from an iphone 6 plus you can tell its a little slower when browsing the web but the rest is fine with me i also love that i can extend my memory with an sd card, i am also happy this has lte im paying $35 A MONTH now for unl talk n text and 2gb of LTE cant beat that"
"Alcatel",4,"I moved from a Note II (T-Mobile) to this Idol 3. I got tired of carrying around a phone that had extra weight and size due to a stylus I never used. I got in on the original pre-order price of $200 and decided to give it a try. I have had the phone a little over a week and would like to run down some of my thoughts.- I like the screen, it is clear and bright and I don’t find myself missing my AMOLED from my Note II.- The screen is very visible in direct sunlight, way better than my Note II, wife’s S3 or G2.- I do not mind the left side power button (I’m left handed) but it takes some getting used to.- Regarding the above I am aware the phone has a double tap to wake/sleep function however I have found it very inconsistent. My wife’s G2 is much more consistent, I would say hers works 95% of the time and this about 50% (to wake, to sleep is much more consistent). I sent an email to Alcatel and they claim they are aware of this issue and plan on addressing it in an update.- It is very light and easy to use with my “medium” sized guy hands.- Case selection is somewhat limited.- It works well with T-Mobile, I get LTE where I did with my Note II and have no issue with wifi, Bluetooth or GPS. I do miss the stock T-Mobile voicemail app (the play store one is buggy).- The camera is quick to focus and takes pretty good photos. Video is good as well. I consider it as good as the one I had on my Note II (I liked that camera).- I like that it is not cluttered with bloat wear. My T-Mobile branded phone was loaded with all kinds of app’s I could not remove. I think this lends to the phone’s efficient use of resources.- Battery life has been good so far, I get through a day. I am a bit apprehensive about the lack of a replaceable battery. I always like the idea of being able to replace/swap mine on my Note II.6/12/15 Update -- The lowest setting for volume for the notifications is way to loud. There are plenty of apps to ""boost"" volume but I can not find a good one for a work around here.- I have not been get 5ish hours of screen on time as many reviewers state. I usually get to about 4 with about 10% battery left. I am not a heavy gamer. Just email, reading web pages and texting. A smattering of clash of clans here and there."
"Alcatel",5,"What can I say?Great phone. Loud speakers, good camera, stock google lollipop!Great battery life!Bright screen, and processor barely shows its budget price.If you want a phone for 250, this is the best option for ya. Best all around phone at this price."
"Alcatel",3,"Great phone but it came with a couple of dead pixels right in the center of the screen. I've never run into dead pixels on a phone before. Returned and waiting for another."
"Alcatel",5,"Got tired of having a contract and over paying for service with a lagy phone that I feel is over priced. This phone has delivered for me exactly what I need, keeps it simple with the OS and features, 2GB are enough for me and my multitasking, it came with an update right out of the box but I have yet to do it. Double tap to wake works, Thou spoty at times, but it works. Great front facing speakers that are loud and clear and the supplied headphones are just perfect. Camera is pretty good, for $250 you get more than what you pay for and the battery life is better than I was expecting, can't go wrong and I have bragged please type to people about this phone."
"Alcatel",1,"Originally I gave this phone a stellar review. However, this phone is a case of you get what you pay for. It stopped charging at 5 week. I just missed the amazon return policy window."
"Alcatel",5,"I decided to buy this phone on a whim after reading several early reviews. I'm glad I did. No, it's not perfect, but you have to consider what you get for your money. Other reviewers have gone into great detail about pros and cons so I won't repeat here. There are a few quirks, but in my opinion, the pros far outweigh the cons. I thought there was a problem with my external SD card when I couldn't access files on the card. It turned out my card was formatted in exFat. Once I formatted it to Fat32, all was well. When I was setting up my phone I somehow lost 2 screen panels and ended up with only one. I had to factory reset and that cured the problem. Also, sometimes the screen digitizer can be a little balky. The speakers are quite good as are the included earbuds. Maybe not as good as HTC's, but still good. The screen is very good for a phone at this price point. The camera was also a pleasant surprise. No, it won't beat the Galaxy S6 or iphone6, but you won't be disappointed either. I found no lag others have mentioned, but then again, I don't play games or launch multiple apps at once. For what I do, it was as smooth as butter. You will get through a day on the battery unless you are a heavy user. Unless you're a true perfectionist, I can't imagine anyone being disappointed with this phone when they consider it cost $250 for a no-contract, unlocked phone."
"Alcatel",5,"This phone is really good I recommended to anybody this is a gret phone for the prise"
"Alcatel",5,"Guys excellent phone than moto g play all with jbl speakers and headphones just buy first and than see the magic good budgeted phone just for 99 dollars"
"Alcatel",5,"I bought this phone for 99dollars .for 99 dollars its a decent phone . If it costs more than 99 dollars I would send it back . I picked it up for a back up phone. I decided to give it a test drive. This phone isn't very powerful . I am going to give a review on what's important to me. 1. Signal. It's allover the place fading in from full bars to no bars of LTE . I discovered if I put it in hspa it's fairly stable . In areas that have a great LTE Signal It's fantastic. 2. Call quality. It's middle of the road not great , not horrible. The moto g4 plus is way better , but the g4 has VOLTE . The idol 3 doesnt.3, battery , it's a little better than okay . If I don't use it , it will last . If I do use it it is just like every other phone .4. Responsiveness. I have a galaxy s7 edge . I am used to touchwiz lag . This phone lags as much as my Samsung . I did change the settings in developer options. 5. Screen ..not bad its fairly bright. 6. Storage it's been updated to 6.1,1. It now has adaptive storage . Buy a good SD card if you are going to use it as adaptive storage.7. Size for 5.5 it feels pretty small and very light. I put a glass screen protector on and my favorite slim case. It feels and looks pretty nice.8. Emails and text they work well. I think if t-mobile didn't force Alcatel to disable band 12 (or if Alcatel paid for band 12 license this review would be better. All in all if you can grab it for 99$ do it. But for more go with the honor 5x or moto g4 . For some reason I like this phone .its over a year old now and still a decent performer ."
"Alcatel",5,"I have never owned a smartphone because I am always near a computer or a family member with a smartphone. On a recent trip, I was amazed at how useful their phones were during our travel (Uber, Lyfte, AirBNB, Airline information, Maps) and decided I would get ready for my contract renewal in a few months, by getting a cheap smartphone and loading it up, via WIFI connection at home. Read the reviews and this one was priced at $99. Why not? It's been a week, and it has been eye-opening. It's replacing my clip on MP3 player, cause it plays MP4s as well. The sound is incredible. I have a 64 GB microSD with all my music, that I hot swap into the phone's dual slide. The slide has space for a microSD and a SIM card. I enjoy the built-in radio, Skyping, and using Viber on my WIFI. I've got apps to read Word and Excel documents, my G-mail updates...it goes on and on. It does take around 20 seconds to boot to a visible screen once you press the on button, and I think that may fool many into thinking the phone isn't working, as they repeating hit the on/off button. Just push on, and have patience. The OS also rebooted several times over the first few days, but after a week, that has finally stopped. Camera takes good pictures but not great. It's been fun, and I haven't even activated my phone yet. Once I do, and probably with Cricket, which uses AT&T towers, everything should be ready and I won't have a learning curve."
"Alcatel",3,"This phone is very slow. Want to navigate somewhere? Well, it might take 3 minutes to load your directions. It also sends and receives group messages from 1970. Very inconvenient because they come in at the bottom your message inbox. It also broke after 6 months. I would not buy this item again! In fact, I despite the money lost I am relived that it broke."
"Alcatel",5,"I just love it and it was a big deal!!! :D"
"Alcatel",5,"this was a great deal at $99. Most reviews don't mention the fact that it as facial recognition and iris scanner as an option to unlock it too. That's something iPhone 7 doesn't even have. I use mine with a magnetic holder in my car with no case necessary since the magnet sticks to where the battery is. Not many other phones do that. The reversible feature is cool too. All the reviews on youtube say it's a great deal at $249. There is no other 5.5"", HD, microSD expandable android phone out there nearly this good at anywhere near this price."
"Alcatel",4,"Very good product! An improvement over my 2 year old moto g no doubt. My one and only issue so far is that sometimes it doesn't respond right away opening an app"
"Alcatel",4,"Take a step back and think about this thing. It has an identical screen to, and RAM of, an Iphone 6 Plus, for a sixth the price. Pop in an SD for more storage. Similar or better form factor too, with nice stereo speakers and better earbuds than an Iphone. Performance is smooth, and it updated immediately to Marshmallow. What's not to like?I guess one thing. Reports around the web indicate the screen may crack under light pressure/drops. So get a case and screen protector. Because this is an older model phone, both can be found cheap at the usual suspects."
"Alcatel",5,"Shipping pretty fast . They left it by my garage, not on my front door or mailbox , which confused me on where it was when I received the notification saying it was on my porch . But overall , it's in perfect shape and it works amazingly . Thank you"
"Alcatel",5,"Gracias, excelente."
"Alcatel",1,"Slow and dead at 14 months. I liked the bright screen and the sound but it no longer works."
"Alcatel",4,"Good sized phone with no connection issues. The price is not too high for anyone looking for something with an HD screen."
"Alcatel",5,"I have had this phone for almost a week. Not one problem. Other than a few lags here and there. A great phone for a unheard of price. I paid $150 for this phone and it runs and feels like a $800 flagship phone. Only down side is I wish it had 4 Gigabyte's of RAM and not the 2 Gigabyte's."
"Alcatel",1,"Phone suffered a screen crack riding in my pocket for 5 minutes while driving 2 months after being purchased. Not very durable. I would not buy it again."
"Alcatel",5,"Very good phone"
"Alcatel",5,"Great phone, great service, and fast. Really great music and headphones."
"Alcatel",5,"Amazing phone for the price. If you're looking for a good Android device and don't want to throw down a chunk, this is well worth it."
"Alcatel",5,"i have had this phone for 2 months now and I do not regret buying it. It is super amazing."
"Alcatel",4,"Haven't gotten around to thinking about dislikes yet"
"Alcatel",5,"Great phone, really loved the quality of the build. feels a quality product very good value for Money."
"Alcatel",5,"Best Phone I've owned so far, it is just amazing. i Love it. it is just as described. The sound quality is amazing, the Speed, the Camera, the gaming capabilities, watching videos on this device gives you the best experience, everything about this phone is awesome.For only $250.00 this is the best phone there is."
"Alcatel",5,"I'm glad I waited when it dropped in price to purchase this and yes I love it cause I'm hard of hearing and the speakers are loud for me, unlike other devices I've had. I would recommend this for anyone who's hard of hearing.I was deciding between this and the Asus ZenFone2 and went by reviews both had good reviews, but I went with the Idol.The camera is good, but I use a different camera app with it for more effects.The battery life is great and it charges quickly more than an Android tablet I have.The screen is nice and clear, the ease of access is good and Alcatel does do the update, for it when it lets you know for an OTA.The only non-issues I have that's there's not enough accessories being the fact it's been out for a few months. Been looking for a Qi charging receiver, tho Alcatel has one, but no one has made a review for it on here. B 3 bottom right is what I'm searching for.I really don't do reviews, but this I thought I would do."
"Alcatel",5,"For the price, the only device that can compare to this for the price is the zenfone 2. The zf2 has a more powerful processor, GPU and 2x the ram for $50 more. Even though I'm usually all about specifications on my devices, I don't play graphically intense games on my phone. (that's what a PC or console is for in my opinion) So I'll take the better screen, slimmer profile, almost completely stock version of Android and the dual JBL audio front facing speakers any day over the slight difference in performance.I've seen some reviews of people receiving units with a few annoying problems but I'm assuming those are either factory defects or refurbished units because I've had nothing but good experiences so far with mine.If I had to find something negative to say about this phone, I'd say the power button placement doesn't make sense at all even for a lefty. But the factory software does allow for double tap to wake and the display does rotate 180° in portrait which takes care of the button placement for the most part. The second thing is that I've noticed a few stutters here and there, and considering I came from a note 3 with the SD800, these slight stutters happen so infrequently that it doesn't bother me and I didn't really pay attention to them till I read about it in some reviews. Either way, I'm pretty sure this is because of the software optimization because other SD615 devices run smother. Hopefully an update to 5.1 or even marshmallow will cure this. If not, bootloader is already unlocked, root is her and there's already twrp available. Custom ROMs should be available soon too."
"Alcatel",5,"Got this when my Nexus 5 died and was amazed at the progress made in android phones since I got the N5 a year ago. For less than half the price of my N5 I got a phone with comparable screen, better battery (being able to charge my phone 1/day is a game changer), better speakers, better camera. Granted the Idol doesn't have the benchmarks of the N5 (or the ZenPhone2) but I haven't noticed it at all in everyday use.If you want a great unlocked phone (with all the GSM LTE bands) and don't want to pay $600, get this phone."
"Alcatel",2,"Terrible call quality, multiple people told me during calls on speakerphone that I sounded far away and that they couldn't hear me well. Maybe it's due to the speakers during calls. I promptly returned. I wonder if the 4.7 inch version also has this same problem"
"Alcatel",3,"Great phone while it worked right but still Luke other Alcatel phones the power button failed to work"
"Alcatel",5,"So first phone I received had some problems, but they were very cooperative at getting me a new one and I got it very fast. This phone has blown me away with what you get with the price. The audio is amazing its up there with the HTC one m8 in my opinion. Only complaint I have is that the original one I recieveced had very nice jbl headphones, and the second one had much cheaper headphones. That doesn't concern the phone but that was quite the disappointment. Had the phone for several months now and I still hold it in the highest regard. Blows the HTC one I had before this, out of the water in every way. And now its 30$ cheaper then when I got it. Even more of a steal."
"Alcatel",5,"This thing is awesome. The battery life is great, i get 4-5 hours of screen on time with half brightness which is great because the speakers cannot be beaten at this price point. They sure beat my old HTC One M7 boom sound speakers. I bought this phone and a case along with a 64 gig Sandisk memory card all under 280 dollars. I like to watch a lot of media so the beautiful big screen and dual front facing speakers is was sold me. The camera is not the best in the world, but more than enough for social media. You can take some real nice shots with it. All in all its a great phone!"
"Alcatel",5,"So far, so good!"
"Alcatel",5,"The size is perfect for average guy. It's large enough for typing w/ 2 thumbs, and small enough for use w/ one hand.The phone is light. So it doesn't bounce around in pants pocket.The battery life is good for a lite user. With cell data mostly off, I typically get 3-4 days.The case design allows secure fit for the soft shell, while exposing the forward facing speakers. Make sure to get a shell, or it might not survive a drop.The only downside is the SD card. It is in the same tray as the Sim card. When I take it out to transfer large files, sometimes it takes a few tries to get both cards aligned when inserting."
"Alcatel",5,"First things first, this is not a perfect phone, but it is pretty damn close and factoring the price I got it for $99, this has been one of the better phones I have used recently. So long story short, broke my Nexus 6 and didn’t want to spend a lot of money on a new phone. I tried out a Sony Ultra C5, I didn’t like the screen at all, otherwise nice phone, so I sold it. Then I tried an LG G3 and it was a great phone but the GPS and camera were terrible. Finally I saw this phone on sale for $99 and figured why not?Well it was a great decision. This phone has been updated to Android 6.01 and everything runs well on it for the most part. This is not a fast phone, but it is a fast enough phone. I am able to browser this Internet, play emulators, and watch movies with ease. Again, it isn’t perfect but for $100, or around that price, it is an amazing value!Highlights:- Fast enough CPU/GPU (with occasional freezes/stuttering, but doesn't get too hot)- Expandable storage- Wonderful front facing speakers that can fill a small room with sound- Decent 1080p IPS LCD screen- Near stock android skin- Excellent all day (with moderate usage) battery life- Fantastic 8mp rear facing camera- Great audio quality with headphones- Surprisingly good call quality- Built in music app is fun and useful- NO BLOATWARELowlights:- Front facing camera is only average with poor low light performance- Multi Media messages like group texts, email texts, and photo texts don’t work on stock messaging app- CPU/GPU does stutter occasionally- Phone is a bit ungainly and slippery in hand for one-hand usagePro-tipsTo fix the MMS bug I mentioned about texts under lowlights, use a third party program off the Google Play Store such as Textra. Additionally, I disabled the “enhanced 4G LTE” setting on the phone and that seemed to help.As for the display, it is great for the price, but it tends to run a little on the “cooler” side in terms of color. You can adjust your color hue under settings. I personally bumped it up one on the color warmth and it looks significantly better. Furthermore, the phone display is extremely bright so things may look a little washed out. To fix this, find an area that is well lit (one that represents where you spend most of your day), and then slide the brightness all the way down, then slowly increase it until you find the colors have the right look about them. Personally, I have mine set to about 35-40% brightness. You can always flip the brightness to “auto” when you go into an extremely bright or dark area."
"Alcatel",2,"buy mobile to you, but I do not work 3G band is only 2G and LTE, also does not come with the onetouch stream."
"Alcatel",5,"I paid $99 here on Amazon and honestly not sure how anyone is staying in business for these specs at that price. The only thing really lacking is a gyroscope but for the price I can't really complain that it's missing. This is loaded with android 6.0.1, everything seems really snappy. This is the first phone I've used with soft keys and it's not bad. The front facing speakers are surprisingly good. However compared to my last phone the audio stream over blutooth is not as loud, meaning in my car I have to turn the dial up in order to have the same volume. I'd advise turning off the JBL special effects otherwise you'll end up with muddled music that is overly bassy, Although maybe you'll like it. The key is that you can atleast toggle this feature on or off depending on your taste.Pros:Nice screen sizePleasant designFront facing speakers sound really great (but will sound distorted at max volume)Speaker and microphone on both sides so you can answer/talk no matter which orientation you have the phone.Micro SD storageLong lasting batteryScreen will work in any orientation (nice for when you want to have the charging cable on the top vs bottom while in the car)Con:No gyroscope"
"Alcatel",3,"Hi.The description of the product say: Is global unlocked and can use in 4LTE but it doesnt work, If you can help me I'll really appreciate that.Anything else is ok.ALCATEL OneTouch Idol 3 Global Unlocked 4G LTE Smartphone, 5.5 HD IPS Display, 16GB (GSM - US Warranty)"
"Alcatel",5,"A great phone but I spend way too much on other accessories which had me throwing it away in the trash."
"Alcatel",5,"Really good phone for the price ($99.99) the phone works well and I am very satisfied with my purchase. The phone has 13mp back camera and it can shoot 1080p HD videos. My service provider is Metro PCS and they were able to activate my phone without any trouble. However I paid a $25 activation fee because I had to purchase a new sim card. Overall i am happy with the phone and i hope it will last a while."
"Alcatel",5,"I'm using this phone 3 weeks now and so far have no complains. I'm not a power user which menas mostly web browsing, Viber, messaging, phone calls etc. My sone downloaded some quite demanding games on it and all were running with no issues. The device is always on WiFi or LTE and I can get a 1.5 days from it easily (4.5 hours SOT).There are some intermittent lags I notice but not really significant. Most of the times the phone is very responsive.I like very much how it looks and it's screen size and quality.My previous phone was Nokia Lumia 830 which had very good rear camera but do not feel this phone is a step back.Overall for 160$ on Amazon this was a very good deal. Hopefully it'll carry at least an year and more."
"Alcatel",5,"Needed a new phone since I broke the screen on my new galaxy 5 in the first 2 months I owned it. I read the reviews and ordered the Idol 3 since it was cheaper than replacing the screen and digitized on the Samsung. I just hoped for the best, and can honestly say I was very pleasantly surprised. The phone looks, feels and operates like a quality product. I like it and its features better than the Samsung. I have had it about a week and could not be more satisfied. We'll see how it goes, but as of now I highly recommend this phone."
"Alcatel",1,"It didn't work. Had a mind of its own. I need to send it back! This was my 2nd one.It did the same thing. I've sworn off Alcatel for good."
"Alcatel",5,"Nice phone for what I paid (99). I'd much rather pay this price whenever my phone breaks then paying 600-800 for another phone!Overall good buy. Works well, has nice features."
"Alcatel",4,"Just recieved the Idol 3 phone by Alcatel. I was a little sceptical about reading a lot of negative reviews about the camera on this phone, but I also own the Alcatel Pop One Touch, which takes very nice pictures usually without even using the flash! So, the first I did was to compare my old phone camera with the new one. I took the same pictures side by side, and this is what I found. Out of the box the new cameras exposure settings needed to be adjusted. If you click on the upper left of the camera screen, (there are three short lines), then choose settings--you will see exposure settings, click on the number 1 setting-- (Not -1). This will lighten up the screen for better picture taking. Under normal circumstances, you will not need a flash even inside your home! This will greatly improve your all around camera quality!! Hope it helps!! Great phone!"
"Alcatel",5,"This phone is amazing . I have a galaxy s4 purchased new when it came out 5 years ago . This phone is right there with it except its bigger and 10 times brighter and vibrant compared to my s4 phone. When My s4 finally dies out this will be waiting to replace it .the only thing they need to mark is where the sim card removal tool is it took me 20 minitues trying to find it"
"Alcatel",4,"Super phone. Poor battery."
"Alcatel",5,"This is a great phone for those of us who want a VERY nice, large screen, excellent battery life and don't need the fastest phone on the market. Yeah, it's slower than the Sammie S6 I got from work, but it isn't a long, painful wait for it to complete a task, just a slight hesitation. Unless you are a serious power user I doubt you'll have a problem with performance. The battery life is better than the S6. And it works as well as the Samsung as an actual phone (yes, I actually make calls on my phone... I'm old).The rear camera is fine... far better than my photography, that's for sure. I don't do selfies, so I don't know how well the front camera works (as indicated above, I'm old).The sound is MUCH better than the Samsung, both from the speaker and headphones, and the music program is easy to use and plays FLAC files.It is light enough that even with an armored case it isn't too heavy, and I quickly got used to the size. It is easier to carry on my belt, but it fits in my pocket. The S6 seems too small to me now, and I will almost certainly get another 5.5"" phone next time..I would have no hesitation buying another Alcatel phone when this one is ready to retire in another year or two. Or maybe three if it keeps working, since it certainly is meeting my phone, e-mail, snapshot and web surfing needs very well."
"Alcatel",3,"Decent phone, shame it died one day after the one year warranty ended. It was while I was playing kingdom hearts unchained x. Symptoms were: phone got hot, touch screen became unresponsive on and off, the next day blue screen, rebooted, another blue screen, then phone completely died.Dual front facing speakers that get nice and loud so that's a huge plus, mine came with jbl earbuds which is awesome considering how most phones don't even include them anymore. But, the placement of the auxiliary port is located at the top of the phone and this is weird because the mini usb port is located on the bottom. If you used one of those magnetic air vent phone holders for you car, things will get messy as there's no clear orientation to have good cable management when you want to plug the auxiliary cable to your phone while charging. However, the reversible design is nice so that you can make the auxiliary cable be located on the bottom relatively by putting the phone upside down.Coming from a samsung galaxy s3, the idol 3's screen is much more vibrant. Also the phone is about 7mm thin which is just 1mm thicker than the thinnest phone out there. Also you should plan on getting a case for the phone, the back of this phone is really slippery with zero grip which is awful for such a thin phone. So if you get sweaty hands due to the heat emitted from this phone, the chance of it falling is quite high. Another plus was that alcatel did provide a software update to Android Marshmallow, which no one thought they would do considering the idol 4 was coming out, the idol 3 was made by a chinese company which don't really provide software support, and that the idol 3 was a budget phone. The stock os doesn't really come with a lot of bloat, although surprisingly, the clock app that comes with the phone is actually made by avg, the same guys that make the antivirus, which no one would have found out until one day play store decided to update the clock app. The updated clock app was terrible because it went away from the google's material design to some awkward interface. The average rating was around 2 stars before avg reverted back to the original clock app. The biggest con I would have to mention is the very slow flash storage, this is really noticeable when you load files or install apps in the play store.Oh well, time to get a new phone and this is just a lesson to always back up your texts and photos as well as get an extended warranty if you plan on using the phone for a very long time. Especially on devices like these where there is no removable back cover. I set the expected usage to a year anyways when I bought the phone considering it was only 250 when I bought it. The phone did get cheaper, but that's to be expected as time goes on.-----update 9/13/16---------Wow, so they still honored the warranty when my phone died. Fantastic service; they went above and beyond. They shipped the phone back with 2 day ups air too."
"Alcatel",1,"I received a paper stapler . not buy cell.The order gives me the option to open a claim as I do please ."
"Alcatel",4,"I Love the Simplicity of this phone and even though its kind of big but it feels good in hand ....Performance is Awesome after upgrading it to marshmallow....Both rear and front cameras are performing well and it did capture good pics in good light conditions but its kind of ok when u don't have adequate lights.... The Call quality is good and audio quality is great but got disappointed when it didn't arrive with the JBL headset (that's why the 4 Star)....overall i am satisfied with the purchase and i would recommend to everyone who wants to have a good smart phone for the daily use........"
"Alcatel",5,"Had this phone for 6 months now with no issues. Works just as well and better than any $700 phone I have had. Seriously folks, it's a phone. We call, we text and we surf the web, why pay $700 for the newest Samsung. It's crazy. Will never buy another high priced phone again."
"Alcatel",5,"I wanted a phone to last all day and I'm not disappointed. It easily lasts all day with various uses and everything about it runs smoothly."

"Alcatel",5,"OK so I got this and it was nice but I couldn't use it because I wanted straight talk and it was gmi or CDMA or GSM one of the two and was not compatible with my cell towers. I live in a rural area with limited Internet and cell phone service. I would buy from a local store. Especially your local Walmart if you want straight talk like me."
"Alcatel",3,"I bought this as a backup phone. It works well for what it is, a cheep smartphone. It wont play much for games or videos but music internet and social media it works decently enough. The battery both dies and charges fast and there is not much in the way of space on the phone but all in all I am ok with my purchase and would recomend anyone looking for a cheep backup or starter phone to give this a try."

"Alcatel",5,"Excellent product. I recommend very happy."
"Alcatel",3,"for the price is what you get, I would like to have the old school designs, with some modern functions, but now every cellphone seems to be very generic product on that segment, the screen is not so responsive, and it feels very very slow. for that segment of price I recommend a windows phone with abetter touchscreen."

"Alcatel",4,"Good phone. Responsive. Works well with Tracfone SIM card installed. Does not have unneeded propriatary apps from other cell phone providers (like an unlocked ATT&T GSM phone I had used that was a Huawei Fusion.But note carefully: It does NOT have 8 GB of internal storage! The description on this page is OFF on two locations, 1) on the heading itself and 2) in the comparison chart.Amazon sent a replacement and it had the same amount of internal storage: 4 GB. So far I have used 2.1 GB of the 4 GB. Whenever I download a new app, I make sure it is stored (if possible) to the 32 GB SD card I have in it. So far, so good, but be aware.I have contacted Customer Service and they are supposed to change the product page to reflect the 4 GB truth."

"Alcatel",5,"I wish I could give it 4.75 stars, but 4 doesn't seem like enough, so I gave it 5. For $65 ($60 as I write this), I have exactly as much phone as I want and need. Sure, the screen could be better, and I miss having an ambient light sensor, but otherwise I'm very happy. It's small enough to fit in my front pants pocket while cycling, TCL's Android is nearly stock and I get two full days on a charge. I ""upgraded"" from a first-gen Moto E, and this adds LTE, a flash (most for the flashlight), and a camera with focus.). Not bad for about half the price two years later."

"Alcatel",4,"I have been using this phone for a couple of weeks now. I really don't need a pricey smartphone so this one is perfect for me.

"Alcatel",5,"Just what I was looking for. Lots of memory."
"Alcatel",4,"A few things are less than perfect like answering when it rings. You have to swipe to answer and it often doesn't take. It does what I need it to and is a great value for the money."
"Alcatel",3,"good"
"Alcatel",5,"I love this phone, especially given the modest cost. It performs well on Freedompop and does not slow down at all as I keep adding applications. Excellent button recognition, even with large fingers."
"Alcatel",5,"I needed a cheap phone to just be able to call, use whatsapp, listen to Spotify and use Runkeeper, and occasionally go online (no fancy app or game), and this phone is just perfect for that. No crash so far (I've had it for 6 months)."
"Alcatel",5,"Great little phone for the price, works great, I get 4G LTE and it works well on T-Mobile. So far I am loving it!"
"Alcatel",5,"I love it. It is marvelous, quickly, smart, and have everithing!"
"Alcatel",3,"The phone I received is model number 5017O-2AALUS1, which meets the description of the ""Global"" Pixie 3 4.5"" -- with one notable exception: It has 4.28GB of total memory, not 8GB.I'm including screen shots from ""Settings-Storage"" and ""Settings--About Phone"" which show the model number and actual memory of my phone. This was a disappointment since I need and expected 8GB. I have since tried without success to find a Pixi 3 4.5"" with 8GB of memory.While it is too limited to be my primary phone at home, I am keeping it to use while traveling in Europe. In addition to the 4G LTE frequencies used by AT&T, T-Mobile, and other GSM operators on this side of the pond, it has the primary European 4G LTE frequency. My home phone does not.On the whole, this is a suitable phone for beginners, those on a budget, and anyone who doesn't need enough memory to run a lot of apps. The screen resolution is less than on more expensive models, which means text and images appear larger. On a 4.5-inch screen, that's a nice benefit for people like me who are a tad hard of seeing."
"Alcatel",1,"Very disappointing overall unlocked phone says, but Venezuela did not work for me digitel 4g Lte, is a failure because in the comments and said that if work specifications."
"Alcatel",4,"I like this ALCATEL OneTouch Pixi 3 4.5-inch CELL PHONE!The 4.5"" size is not too big for my hand! I thought I'd never want anything bigger than my 3.5"" ipod, but I am able to hold this in one hand and touch the buttons without any difficulty.As a phone -- it works great -- I can hear clearly and so can the person on the other end. So far, no problems with sound at all.The camera works fine -- takes a good, clear photo. There are TWO cameras -- one front for FaceTime or Skype and one on the back for taking photos.The mobile operating system -- Android Lollipop 5.0 -- has so far allowed me to make calls without any problems.It's UNLOCKED. Global System for Mobile (GSM) for mobile communication means that I will be able to change the SIM card when I go to Europe. (At least I hope so -- I haven't tried this yet.) It also means I can change from AT&T to a different carrier if I wish to in the future. I can use pre-paid wireless plans, rather than sign up for a long-term contract -- I like these features!It holds a charge for days. I don't use this much, but I can leave it on for days before it needs to be charged. If I talked on it constantly, I assume it would need charging more often.Screen shows time and date, strength of mobile signal and wifi signal and battery charge percentage. On screen quick use icons: phone, music, calculator, camera, contact list, product code scanner. After you swipe icons: phone, messaging, menu, email, google, camera, gallery. Press Google and several icons for different apps appear. Press menu and 20 icons appear for different apps.Why do I like it and not love it -- it didn't come with a SIM. I tried to get a Tracfone SIM package at Walmart but they didn't have it. They could order it, though. I went to the at&t store where the sales associate put in the SIM and sold me a package that got progressively more expensive as we went along. First it was $25 -- okay, not too bad. Then another $30 for ""RTR"" (a month's worth of minutes?), then a 40-cent FEE, AND TAX $3.85. I got out of there for $59.25 for the SIM and one month of service! Add this to the cost of the phone and one hopes that this is a phone that will work well for years. (I realize I have to add more minutes and this will cost more.) One big benefit -- the sales rep installed the SIM, let me select from a list of potential phone numbers and then swiped through a series of installation menus. (Thank you Dyllan!)One caveat: I noticed that the sales rep had to scratch off the waxy surface on the SIM package. These ""shavings"" stick to the fingers and could easily get on the SIM card, which is quite small, and ""gum up"" the electronics when the card slips into its slot.This comes with earphones, a manual, charger plug and an in-depth online manual and online support. I couldn't find much online information about installing the SIM and depended on amazon's great Q&A feature and the advice of some very helpful and supportive people."
"Alcatel",5,"Good cell phone, is like the description, is unlocked for Digitel and Movistar in Venezuela"
"Alcatel",5," Let's get the specs out of the way. You can find specs online for this model, but I'll make it easy and list the biggies for you:Originally launched in August of 2015Phone Size: 5.55 x 2.81 x 0.39 inDisplay: 480x854 pixels (196 ppi density) This isn't super great but it's respectable, especially if this is your first smart phone!Lollypop OS, likely won’t be upgraded to Marshmallow (that is a guess – I don’t know that for sure but Marshmallow is getting pushed out now) Dual core processorMemory: Internal 8 GB, 1 GB RAM (4G model, which this is) also a micro SD slot up to 32GB but you must add that yourself, it is not included.Camera is a 5 megapixel. Has auto focus, Flash, Geo-taging. Video is 720p at 30 frames per second.. Selfie mode is 2 mp.Has Bluetooth capabilities, and GPS.Battery is a removable and is a 1400mAh battery.What to like about it? It's an inexpensive entry level phone. If you live in an area that gets good service from the providers they listed this would be an excellent option. If you live in an area where you can only get Verizon service (which this phone is not compatible with) then this would not be a good choice as a cell phone. Research what carrier people in your area use to see if it is one of the recommended ones.I found it to be pretty responsive, and it works just like my more expensive Note 4. Google Play store access, and most everything runs fine on this phone that I tested out.This phone has the advantage of the SD slot to add extra memory, which I did. In this way I can put all my movies and music on there and have them handy all the time. 32GB is fairly large and you can fit a lot on there.The battery is removable so if you wanted to buy an extra battery to ""swap out"" in emergencies if you didn't have a way to charge it - that is so handy. I do that with my other phone and I feel sorry for people without removable batteries. I travel a lot and so having that is a huge win.What not to like about it? For me the screen is way too small. But I am used to a HUGE phablet style phone. So for me the small screen seems like a downgrade. You may not feel that way though... it is subjective.Who is this phone good for? First time smart phone users for sure. For kids who you don't want to spend a lot of money to have a phone for, but still need a smart phone. Or budget conscious people. This phone is not very costly. These are the three main groups."
"Alcatel",5,"my brother love this phone i send this phone back in philippines and very well preformance"
"Alcatel",3,"Item arrived 1.5 weeks late! I requested -and paid- for a 2-day shipment and did not receive the item on time.Quality was good. As expected.Case is black, but its back side has some shining pieces...which may be OK for women but not for men. Item description unfortunately did not clarify this."
"Alcatel",5,"best"
"Alcatel",1,"Not a global 4G LTE band, don't suport (B3)I bought this phone because I thought it was really unlocked 4G LTE world is global and even 3G UMTS is only ( 2G) GSM Quad Band Unlocked"
"Alcatel",4,"good"
"Alcatel",5,"This is a good phone for the price, runs latest android and all needed apps very smoothly. Can do everything except take good selfies because the front camera isnt very good, but still usable in decent amount of light. Perfect for people who want to run a large selection of apps for a cheap price."
"Alcatel",5,"Very nice"
"Alcatel",2,"The phone instrument is too frail and the touch is not friendly. Have not had the phone more than a month but I am not happy with it."
"Alcatel",3,"Great compact, economical phone. The only downside is the internal storage space. I can't even fit Twitter on my new phone as it wants to install everything on the internal memory."
"Alcatel",4,"Good phone. Responsive. Works well with Tracfone SIM card installed. Does not have unneeded propriatary apps from other cell phone providers (like an unlocked ATT&T GSM phone I had used that was a Huawei Fusion.But note carefully: It does NOT have 8 GB of internal storage! The description on this page is OFF on two locations, 1) on the heading itself and 2) in the comparison chart.Amazon sent a replacement and it had the same amount of internal storage: 4 GB. So far I have used 2.1 GB of the 4 GB. Whenever I download a new app, I make sure it is stored (if possible) to the 32 GB SD card I have in it. So far, so good, but be aware.I have contacted Customer Service and they are supposed to change the product page to reflect the 4 GB truth."
"Alcatel",3,"THE PONE WAS WORKING GREAT, BUT AFTER 5 MONTHS I DON'T KNOW WHY THE BRIGHTNESS OF THE SCREEN SUDDENLY IS GOING CRAZY!! HOPE SOMEONE CAN HELP ME!!"
"Alcatel",5,"great basic phone for whatsapp instagram messenger twitter facebook etr"
"Alcatel",4,"No"
"Alcatel",5,"Perfect"
"Alcatel",5,"it was as expected"
"Alcatel",5,"It's nice. I'm using it with my government sim card. It makes a good replacement phone for the Obama phone."
"Alcatel",5,"I wish I could give it 4.75 stars, but 4 doesn't seem like enough, so I gave it 5. For $65 ($60 as I write this), I have exactly as much phone as I want and need. Sure, the screen could be better, and I miss having an ambient light sensor, but otherwise I'm very happy. It's small enough to fit in my front pants pocket while cycling, TCL's Android is nearly stock and I get two full days on a charge. I ""upgraded"" from a first-gen Moto E, and this adds LTE, a flash (most for the flashlight), and a camera with focus.). Not bad for about half the price two years later."
"Alcatel",4,"No problem with the cell. It works amazingly well"
"Alcatel",5,"For the price, this model from Alcatel is pretty good for those seeking budget phones w/ features."
"Alcatel",5,"Desided to keep this product after thankyou"
"Alcatel",2,"I bought this phone as a gift for my friend in Russia. My own phone (LG) cost me $100 and it's great! So the price and the features of ALCATEL OneTouch Pop 3 Global Unlocked 4G satisfied me too.First of all I didn't like both cameras. I'm into photography, I DO know how 5MP and 2MP pictures look like. So the front camera is not even remotely close to 2MP (probably 0.3 or MAX 1MP). The main camera is not that bad but pics come out A LITTLE BIT worse than 5MP. Even though I set both cameras to the highest quality.Well it's okay. Not a big deal... I guess.What has REALLY disappointed me is language settings!!! Yes, this phone has a keyboard in (I guess) any language. You can type in EN, Russian, German etc. BUT there are only FOUR languages available to set as the main language. The phone's menu can be in English, French, Spanish or Italian ONLY. Tha'ts it! I understand that English is an international language but not everyone speaks English! My friend in Russia doesn't! Even my own phone has a bunch of languages including Russian.The menu, apps, notifications are in EN.I spent all day searching for any apps or drivers that could help me to add more languages. Nothing! Btw there are no official drivers for this phone. When I hooked up it to my computer it showed me that it had its own drivers. I clicked ""install"" and NOTHING happened.I am still going to send it to my friend but if only we find out it is not GSM unlocked I will get it back to the US and return to Amazon. I just have a hard time to believe the features that the company has claimed.P.s. I am actually returning this product because I do not trust its description. I don't want to risk and spend more money."
"Alcatel",1,"The phone is messed up do mot ever turn the phone off or reboot because the phone goes only as far as where it says alcatel onetouch i can't use my phone this day 2 and still can't use it."
"Alcatel",5,"Its a good phone so far no problems incounterd reliable."
"Alcatel",4,"Price was very good,nice look and feel. Many apps run just as well as other top phones but at 1/4 the cost. If you buy one order a good screen protector and put it on first thing. Now that I had it a while comparing it to a flagship model isn't fair but how many can you buy for the price of a flagship ? about 4 to 6 depending on which you chose. Add a 2 year warranty and that beat my carriers protection policy hands down."
"Alcatel",5,"Great!"
"Alcatel",2,"Not sure if I just got a defective one, but it's slow, laggy, freezes, and heats up easily."
"Alcatel",5,"Very Pleased!"
"Alcatel",3,"The phone (ALCATEL OneTouch Pop 3 Global Unlocked 4G LTE Smartphone, 5.5 HD Display, 8GB (GSM - US Warranty)) stopped working this morning, won't turn on, I tried everything, nothing work. I took it to a mobile store and ask for help, they tried turn it on and nothing happened, after several attempts the phone finally turned on. I worry this happen again, Do I should return it and ask for a new one or a refund?"
"Alcatel",1,"I bought this phone for my mom a few weeks ago and after about a week of usage it stopped working. The phone is dead and will not turn on no matter what we try. And to make things even worse, the day it stopped working was the day after we could no longer return it.I see a 2 year warranty sticker on the packaging, does anyone have any information on how I can contact the seller here? I've looked all through the product listing and I don't see any contact information. We would like a new phone or our money back please and thank you."
"Alcatel",3,"This phone is a very nice size. Easy to start up just insert the SIM card and turn on. My problem is the phone is very slow. I bought this for my husband he likes it. It is a good phone for a beginner. I also bought a phone for myself and returned it after several weeks. I could not handle the slow processing speed. When I returned the phone the seller credited my account as soon as UPS scanned the package in. Excellent customer service."
"Alcatel",3,"Disappointed with the phone compared to there idol 3 model I ordered several days ago . The display is no were near as bright and vibrant and its slow when downloading and switching between different screens. It will serve its purpose which is to be used as my travel phone when I go out of the country and I dont wont to bring my good phone with me in-case it lost or stolen ."
"Alcatel",4,"It is of high quality comparable to Samsung galaxy note. Pretty good. I recomend everyone to use this phone.Thanks"
"Alcatel",4,"Super smarter-than-me phone, great for a newbie such as myself. I just wish the user's manual had print big enough to read. Even with my 2.5x reading glasses, I have to use a magnifying glass."
"Alcatel",1,"This phone was great for about the first week I had it. Now I have to restart it about 2x a day because it freezes so much. It has trouble connecting to the WIFI, and it runs really slow. It has about a gig of space left on it, and none of the apps I use are very heavy. Not to mention I close them all the time! Going to be looking for a new phone very soon. Will not buy again."
"Alcatel",3,"worth the price"
"TCL Mobile",5,"Serves its purpose really, simple cheap touchscreen"
"TCL Mobile",1,"Micro phone went out july 3 and I got the phone in May"
"TCL Mobile",5,"Serves its purpose really, simple cheap touchscreen"
"TCL Mobile",1,"Micro phone went out july 3 and I got the phone in May"
"Alcatel",1,"We ordered two of these and were excited when we received them - until they started making random calls."
"Alcatel",1,"I have had this phone for less than 24 hours and it reboots itself over and over. Will be returning today."
"Alcatel",5,"Very happy with this product! For now is working good. If have something i edit this review. Good Phone so far!!! Still working very good! 30/9/16"
"Alcatel",5,"please note the description of this phone, it clearly states the phone is unlocked, well the phone I received was LOCKED. I lost a week of service from straight talk because the phone did not work(like an unlocked phone should) this is/was so frustrating! How do you make this right?"
"Alcatel",5,"just great, best value for money."
"Alcatel",5,"Not too shabby"
"Alcatel",4,"Its basic and good. decent camera and speed is OK."
"Alcatel",4,"I was previously using both a BlackBerry Z10 and a 7"" Kindle Fire. I needed a new phone and the Kindle was dropped.. I figured that I would get the best of both worlds. This phone does what is advertised, it has a nice looking screen and I can tell the speed is faster than the Z10 and on par with the Kindle I was using. I think the stats on this device are certainly mid-level but I have had no issues using it overseas. The battery life is unremarkable and I'm sure there are better screens but so far so good. For the price you can't beat it especially for traveling overseas, it has too SIM card slots also. I almost wish I had gotten a 5 inch screen this is a little big..."
"Alcatel",5,"what accessories you get with the phone"
"Alcatel",5,"This is a great android phone for the price. I was surprised to learn that the phone has 2 sims slots and a slot for a micro SD card for more memory. My previous phone would immediately recognize external memory with my music.. However I have found that this phone does not immediately identify external memory, through the micro USB port. It may be a software issue? However, I can add up to a 128 GB micro SD card internally. I can load plenty of photos, music and other media.I prefer a 6 inch display but it is very difficult to find a case. There are various pouches available but an otterbox type case/cover has been almost impossible to find."
"Alcatel",5,"I have previously had brand name phones on contract my last one being Samsung Note Edge (5"" screen). Never again. This phone is excellent. The screen is clear and the 6"" size is awesome. volume is loud, GPS works great, call quality is clear. Photos are adequate with the 5MP camera, battery life is great. The home screen it comes with is nice but I installed Nova Settings app which is even better. I also installed the Swiftkey app to replace the stock Android keyboard. I am using it on Straight Talk AT&T and have a great signal.I had previously tried the Posh E600 and this is far better for about the same price or less."
"Alcatel",2,"First off I loved the phone! Then out of nowhere it shuts down and reboots out of nowhere!! It is seriously passing me off and going back to the windows 10 phone!!!!!"
"Alcatel",5,"Love my phone. I get bored with phones very quick and purchase a ""new"" phone off Amazon almost every 6 months, sometimes sooner but I am hoping this will be my last. Trying to find a 6"" phone with the latest updated software AND for a very good price takes allot of research. I almost purchased a 5.5"" phone but at the last minute I saw this Alcatel PIXI 4 so snapped it up. I was hesitant to show my phone around if it said PIXI on it but thank goodness it does not.. Phone performs well and sound is not bad (still prefer my Nexus 6 for sound quality). In have yet to figure out the SD card issue I seem to have with this phone unless it's happening with other android devices too. I am using Net10 on the Lte network and its running well. I am having wi fi issues but not sure if its phone related or my home network which has been an issue."
"Alcatel",4,"decent dual sim phone that gets the job done. The display is good but the the ZEN UI is not my cup of tea. Button layout are a bit to high up for me but it gets the job done as a backup phone. This does not work with Verizon or Sprint but works fine with ATT. I do recommend getting a case and tempered glass since the product feels cheap."
"Alcatel",5,"Simple which I like"
"Alcatel",5,"This was a Christmas present and the user is well satisfied with it. It was an upgrade from a much older phone. She finds it easier to text and to use."
"Alcatel",2,"This was an improvement upon the old one. I still have issue with this one too. My first one had a white screen, and after buying a new one (this one) i found out it cant hold a charge. So if i need to charge it i have to use my old one to charge the battery then swap them out. Maybe its just bad luck but honestly i would recommend buying a different brand or model."
"Alcatel",5,"Everything I expected it to be Thanks"
"Alcatel",1,"Terrible"
"Alcatel",3,"This phone comes in a kit. The kit is incomplete as the SIM card has been removed. In addition, the phone itself is refurbished. Returned for a refund."
"Alcatel",5,"GOOD ITEM"
"Alcatel",2,"not true to size"
"Alcatel",5,"Great phone for the nonsmart phone type of person. Easy to unlock and navigate."
"Alcatel",1,"Horribe customer service. Phone just ""exploded"" after one month, vendor asked if I dropped in or had in water (I dropped once, but having had bought this model several times before, this type of phone tends to last a year before breaking even if dropped). Furthermore, there are other vendors selling this ""new"" phone (which actually T-Mobile discontinued, so it is bordering on false advertising not to mention this fact) for half the price that this vendor sold it to me for-quite the rip off!"
"Alcatel",5,"Simple"
"Alcatel",4,"I like it, it does what I needed it to do. Takes great photos too."
"Alcatel",4,"Very nice product but mine has some issues. The battery keep un charging too fast. Even after charging it for hours"
"Alcatel",3,"I really liked the original Sparq cell phone because of the keypad that flips out. I hate texting so it works great for me. Although the keypad on this one looks nicer it is not as easy to use especially if you like to use punctuation. There's these annoying icons that keep appearing at the top of the screen when you use different things that I don't know how to remove. The battery life is not as good either although not terrible. The camera is terrible as well. It is an okay phone for a dumb phone but I think I will be looking for another one soon."
"Alcatel",3,"sometimes shut down or blanks out during a texting."
"Alcatel",3,"Some time after purchase (about 2 weeks), the screen turns off when I try to use the keyboard on it. It happens randomly."
"Alcatel",5,"Phone did not work long but I give 5 stars to the owner he worked with me and we solve the problem. I would do business again with him.I recommend doing business with him he stands by his product."
"Alcatel",2,"So I have two of these phones and they both continually shut off for no reason. My sons are getting pretty tired of it. It's not a bad phone for a teenager that doesn't need to have a smart phone with social media options, but it is very annoying to have it shut off ALL the time on its own. Think twice before buying this one."
"Alcatel",3,"Could be better"
"Alcatel",5,"Needed a simple phone for my mom. This phone fits the bill. Great price.it's not a touch screen phone, but that's fine."
"Alcatel",4,"Kids don't use data plans worked out great..."

"amar",2,"I took it to Haiti to give it to someone it doesn't work, I need to return it, please"
"amar",3,"Not bad so far I have not tried the phone feature. The pad is fast if you do not load all the crap to it. It also says it will use a USB device VIA the cable that was in the package with it. However upon trying it, it seems to have failed as a feature that actually works for this one I have. The You tube installed does not work properly it says try again and you can not uninstall this alone it is connected to google. When going into an account it stalls out in you tube."
"amar",2,"VERY BAD PRODUCTNo point of buying this product I may look good but it's a andriod.have a very bad camera. You also can't call on this tab."
"amar",1,"It would appear that the screws for the screen bezel were over tightened and the screen has been cracked. Shoddy workmanship or sub standard screen!"
"amar",5,"Yes I'm enjoying it more daily. Thanks again for such speedy corrections."
"amar",1,"Piece of junk. The pics from the camera are very fuzzy/can't see them clearly. The volume is very low on the audio. To hear you mist use the earphone."
"amar",4,"Works Good so far.."
"amar",2,"Good 4 3 days and then super slow & freezes.."
"amar",4,"Is very nice and presentable"
"amar",2,"fair"
"amar",5,"Excellent"
"amar",1,"I rate this a one (just for kicks) because I am very unhappy with the phone. It has a lot of issues with it. I can't even check my voicemail because the voicemail icon doesn't work. The phone constantly freezes and I have to continuosly turn it off and on. The picture quality of the camera sucks. I really would appreciate returning it for either my money back or a brand new replacement"
"amar",5,"it is very good"
"amar",1,"I need a refund its not competable wit my Simms card how do I get a refund"
"amar",5,"great"
"amar",2,"Un poco lenta. Y se apaga"
"amar",5,"Quality feel and product right out the box"
"Amazon",4,"Great phone. Super screen. Only negative is that it connects to Amazon store and my account so purchases are not controlled if you give it to your kid."
"Amazon",5,"Considering the high quality recharger, the okay earplugs (and, I think, free Prime for a year), the phone is almost free. Yet, this is a $600 smartphone.My wife & I live off our Kindles, so this phone works out of the same Amazon account & Cloud as our Kindles. My wife is having a good time figuring this new toy out (yes, the occasional woman can suffer from ""Men & Their Toys Syndrome""), and is especially pleased that it is replacing a DumbPhone (Patent Pending).She likes the 3-D, the daily picture wallpaper, the audiobooks, and the speed at which she can view & dispose of emails. Her texting has sped up thanks to the feature that gives you 5 or 6 choices of what the next word could be (as opposed to my old rotten Apple that picks what it assumes is the 1 most likely word & sometimes auto-corrects your correct word).On the one we got, hearing through the earpiece isn't great, while hearing through the speakers - e.g., music or audiobooks - IS great. The one we got also looks brand-new, so it couldn't have been used too much.The screen is a bit hypersensitive, so we're trying a protective film next to see if that helps.Despite reading here that some apps are not being properly updated by Amazon, we haven't experienced that personally.Amazing value as a phone, as a toy, as a utilitarian communication device, and as an Amazon shopping portal.

"JUNING",1,"Phone didn't even work"
"JUNING",1,"Phone does not hold charge. At all. Ordered replacement, replacement has the same problem. Phone looses charge in about 2 hours from 100% to 20% while NOT in use."
"JUNING",2,"Bought this for my husband. Very poor sound quality. It was difficult to hear who ever your talking to, and there was an echo. Returned."
"JUNING",5,"This phone works great and I am very very happy with my purchase. The phone is charging great right now as of 2:39pm. UPS bought my package right and The driver said ""I have another package for you"" Thank You Amazon!!! The price is reasonable for this phone as well. What I also like about this phone is the flashlight. The previous phone I had didn't have no flashlight as well as how smaller it was. It was a Samsung S730G and I am glad I have upgraded. The time frame was also great and I am hope that Amazon keeps up the great work! THANK YOU, THANK YOU AGAIN AMAZON AND AMAZON PRIME!!"
"JUNING",5," I am in love with my new phone! I just love everything about it!It comes with everything that I would need including a phone case (it was a protective clear case) and a pair of headphones and of course the charger for it. It was really easy and super fast to download any of the apps that I needed. I really liked how it already came with facebook downloaded on it, so I really appreciated that because that app is a must for me.The screen on this cellphone is really huge! I love how great of a picture that it gets! I really enjoy being able to watch my movies and tv episodes on my phone. It's so huge it's almost like watching it on my tablet!The sound is impeccable and very clear and it gets really loud.I really appreciated that I didn't have to go stand in a long line at the phone store to get it turned on and to have everything switched over.All I had to do was just take my sim card out of the old phone and insert it into this one and everything instantly transfers over and it instantly starts working. I am not a big tech savy person but I also don't have the time or patience to stand in the lines at the phone store, so for to be able to just put my sim card in and get it to work is really amazing and I have to say one of my favorite things about this phone because it really saved me time and money this way.It was super fast to be able to not only connect to WiFi, but it was very easy to connect to Bluetooth not to mention how fast it was to connect!This phone has many different options like ringtones and more and this fits my personality so well and has everything on it that I find important to live an every day life when it comes to technology.It's a very affordable phone and I love everything about it!I instantly noticed a big difference with this phone compared to my last one and I can now enjoy so much more on my phone and I love that about this!Disclaimer: I was able to purchase this product at a discount or for free in exchange of my honest and unbiased opinion"
"JUNING",5," First of all I would like to mention how slim and elegant this Android 5.1 Smartphone Unlocked 5.5"" from Juning. I got the gold color and I love it!. They also have a white and black color in the website. This has a 1.3 GHz Processor and 512MB RAM/8GB ROM.Below are some of the great features on this phone:Camera - It has a dual camera (both 2MP front and back camera). But the back camera is actually really good. I have attached here some of the photos that I just took using this phone. It also has a smile feature which is pretty cool. When this feature is turned on you will be able to take a picture automatically once a smile has been detected by the camera.Video - With the 5.5"" display you can have a great view of the videos and it is also pretty bright.Air Gesture - When air gesture is turned on you will be able to move the pictures/app by simply swiping your palm on the sensor in front of the phone. This feature can be found under settings - accessibility - gesture.Smart Wake - This feature would let your phone wake up while it is asleep by simply double tapping the screen. You can find this feature under settings - accessibility - gesture - smart wake.Mobile Anti-Theft - With this feature you will be able to remotely take control of your phone when you will lose it or it will get stolen. You just have to add an emergency contact number to this phone. There will be 3 things that you can do. First is to send a message from your emergency contact number a word that states ""#suoding#"" in order to remotely lock your phone so that nobody would be able to access it unless they know your PIN. Second is to send the word ""#xiaohue#"" to completely wipe out the data on your phone and lastly is to send the word ""#mima#"" to fetch back your PIN.Letter Gesture - This is my favorite feature of all because this serves as your quick access to apps/galleries. While your phone is asleep just simply type in the letter that you have set on the black screen. You can customized this with the apps/icons that you prefer. This can be found on settings - accessibility - gesture- letter gestures.The package incudes the following:1 x Cellphone1 x Battery1 x USB Cable1 x Charger1 x Earphone1 x Transparent silicon caseI highly recommend this inexpensive phone to everyone.I got this item at a discounted price in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.

"Odysseus",1,"the cellphone never works and never refound"
"Odysseus",1,"At first glance buying this phone was a smart solution. Everything looked perfect, but one day (after a month of using it) something happened with a battery, it got bigger just like bugled and quite visible gap appeared between the back panel. Moreover battery life is only a couple of hours. It is impossible to use this phone at all. Very dissapointed."
"Digital SNITCH",5,"Recovers exactly what it is suppose to."
"Digital SNITCH",1,"Old program and updates don't work."
"Digital SNITCH",1,"This crap DOES NOT WORK! They also do not tell you upfront the limitations of data that can be retrieved from phones or what types of phones are compatible."
"Digital SNITCH",3,"Only works on old android systems"
"Digital SNITCH",1,"Does that work!"
"star",1,"I bought this phone due to it being what i wanted without paying $500 for a phone. It says it comes with a 3100mAh battery no it dont it came with 2 2800mAh batteries. The camera is not what its supposed to be which is 8mp its only a 5mp camera. The S pen that it comes with isnt an S pen and dont even work on the phone unless u press hard. Everything about the phone is not what i assumed i was paying for. I bought 2 of these phones one for me and one for my husband and were purchesed at the same time but when the phones arrived i only got one phone and when i contacted the company they said they r sorry for the inconvenience do u still want the phone well yes i want the phone i paid for it. It comes from china so it takes anywhere from 11 to 21 days. I have been in daily contact with the company about these phones due to all the issues with the phone not being what i paid for"
"star",3,"Nice phone, but volume is really low and the screen came with a crack to the lower left side :l"
"star",1,"my play store doent work.charger very wiggly wont charge well onless i hold onto it.dont buy from wieze.not compatible with fmily mobile"
"star",5,"it does everything the note 2 do and even had a few surprises that caught me off guard love the look as well"
"star",2,"Picked this up as I'm travelling to the Philippines and wanted a phone I wasn't worried about being stolen.....Paired it with a Tmobile Simple Choice plan to have unlimted data and text roaming overseas.GoodScreen easy to read and bigEasy setup, pop the sim and goBadFeels cheapWon't get anything but 2G on TmobileBattery sucks on Edge (2G), at times barely gets 4 hours standbyGoogle Play is a hacked version with Chinese only, can't seem to install the real one, just errors out. In other words, you're not tying this to your account but can still get Skype, Facebook, etc apps through the chinese hacked one.Can't seem to calibrate the screen, senses touch a bit off so typing is no fun.Overall it will serve its purpose as a travel phone so I don't risk losing my Nexus 5. Other than that its not worth your money. I'll leave mine with a Homeless guy when I leave the PI.There must be several different models as mine has a Samsung rear cover and battery, front looks like Samsung with text over it, boot screen is Samsung, MTK reader shows its a fake, sim slots different than what is shown above on Amazon. Accepts Standard and Micro sim, have read standard is voice only....don't know."
"star",4,"The phone is very responsive. Works perfectly with both sims. Wi-fi works well. I am not comfortable with pictures though. Not sure it is 8 mp. Screen gets dark while making calls. Overall, a very good phone."
"star",3,"Very nice phone! Just wish the screen was bigger runs on 2g everything functional and cool gigAvailable with simple mobile net10,t mobile etc"
"star",4,"This was an emergency buy since my girlfriend broke her Samsung s2.Good:2 sim slotsMicro sd slotBig screenLow priceBad:Low screen resolutionLow pixels in cameraPoor flash lightRequired 3G configurationI had some trouble connecting to the 3g network, fixed by creating a new APN somewhere in the settings.works great in Telcel network after that.The screen resolution is nowhere to be compared with the hd screens of the Sanmsung phones, but for the money I can't complain."
"star",5,"I looooove this phone. I couldn't wait to open it up and start to play with it lol If you're looking for a great unlocked phone..try this one"
"star",2,"It's way too heavy, the camera sucks big time, it says is 8mp and its actually 2mp. The led never worked and the extra battery didnt either. the menu botton is too hard to use. Earphones were broken. Didnt like this cellphone at all. Please, re.check your choices before purchasing this."
"star",2,"Instead of getting the N7100, I got the N9002. Wrong phone. When I first got it, the charger wasn't working, because the phone was charging in reverse. I finally had to get a charger for the phone. Now, it seems like every minute, even when the phone is charged, it keeps shutting off and the only way to turn it back on is to remove the battery and plug in the charger. When I try to turn it on, the batter shows red. It's getting really annoying now. Sometimes on a call it shuts off."
"star",5,"Good! Love it"
"star",1,"Center of screen stopped working after a few weeks!?"
"star",5,"very good"
"star",4,"It's one of the best phone I ever bought"
"star",2,"I have to keep rebooting to keep signals but, if you want it to work with just wifi it's ok."
"star",4,"The phone is good, but when you are talking to someone,the volume level is very low, you can't hear the person very well unless you put it on speaker out which is not good, It need improvement."
"star",5,"I love my phone it work good and I also get it before the delivery time thanks guys nice job"
"star",3,"Nice phone but very slow and sometimes no Internet access. Had great options but couldn't use most of them."
"star",4,"I would give this phone five but at the moment I am threw tmobil and can only pick up 2g service so it runs slow but will cathch 3g when it can. As far as the phone its selef goes its great it is like a normal android except super sized. So far I like it they had it to me by 8:15 the next morning so good job on the shipping and it comes with a 1 year warranty so def. Worth the money."
"star",4,"Good phone..i just bought 2 of them..and i'm still waiting if something will happen in the future..but for now its still good and that price is good for a big phone like that with a case.."
"star",4,"nice phone for the price. arrived fast"
"star",2,"[UPDATE: I finally gave up on Chinese knockoffs and ordered a real Samsung S4 Active currently listed for 339 which is less money than I have in imitations. This particular phone would have worked for me [for a while] but I realized I could not live without a functional camera after surprising a Great Heron wading in the pond bordering my yard and catching a wonderful picture of some sort of 7' shadow against an indeterminable washed out background.][UPDATE-2 In the process of changing providers I found myself needing to use two SIM's at once so I brought this phone back into temporary service. The ring alert tells me which line is calling and prompts me to choose a SIM when I cam calling out so it functions well for me using dual SIM.Also, I bought an Extreme Rugged Impact Armor Hybrid Hard Case Cover with Belt Clip Holster and Kickstand for Samsung Galaxy Note 2 N7100 with a soft inner liner that fits almost perfect. The ear jack does not line up just right but that can be fixed with an exacto blade because the hard shell is out of the way enough. I bought mine from Sqdeal but after purchasing I saw the same case available from other sellers.][Update 3 - 10/27/2015 Dropping down from 3 stars to 2 after I started using it in WIFI mode to run perk/swagbucks applications. It died after a month or two and cannot boot up. Combined with the time I spent using this as a phone I got maybe 6 months use out of it altogether. I have tried several of the Chinese knockoffs and would advocate buying a genuine older or used Samsung to save money before buying another lookalike or clone]ORIGINAL Phone review [updates in brackets]:When the reviews mentioned poor camera quality I ignored them because my camera needs are so very low. Unfortunately the main camera on this unit does not live up to even the lowest of expectations. The problem is not the resolution, which is 5M and many times more than I need, but the white-balance and exposure fills the screen with large blotches that are either whited out or too dark, what's left of the color is tinted green, blue, or pink, with a hazy rainbow border depending on how the camera is tilted, and even a flat surface has all but the specific target square fuzzy and out of focus. Using the manual settings or installing ""A Better Camera"" from the Google store makes it a little better but the help this camera needs is beyond any that can be derived from software.Other than that I liked this phone. The GPS was good. While indoors I can pick up all 8-12 satellites available to me where previous smartphones have only been able to pick up 2-4 without going outside. [UPDATE: when my new Samsung S4 Active arrived it found 25 satellites from inside the house and was able to lock onto more than half of them almost instantly leaving all prior phones in the dust.]The screen resolution may be lower than a real Note 2 but it looks fine to me with a wide clear field of vision. On the brightest setting it was as visible to me in the sunlight as any phone I have owned, although I am told some high end phones these days are better than any I have ever owned. [UPDATE: When my real Samsung arrived I found out how much a camera is truly capable of staying visible in the sunlight. This phone under review seemed tolerable at the time but I was always searching for shade. The Samsung I only need to tip it a little and according to reviews my model is on the low end for screen visibility of top end phones.]I do not think any of these multi-band secondary market phones have great mobile data speed. The data speed on my Airvoice (AT&T MVNO) connection tested at ~365kbps for me which would certainly be frustrating to a youtube addiction but plenty fast to Google up an address on the road or check email. To minimize data needs I set apps to never sync or sync on WIFI only and have email set to download on demand with just the headers unless it is something that needs to be opened. Other than that I save my power browsing for WIFI which gets more ubiquitous every day.There is no battery charging indicator. The extra battery may come in handy some time and is easy to install but no free-standing charger so it needs to be in the phone to charge. Battery life seemed normal with the phone standing by but as soon as I started actively engaging doing searches and trying to get the camera working it seemed to draw down rather quickly.[EDIT: Subsequent to leaving this review I neglected to turn off the GPS while leaving the phone charging in the car. After about a half hour I returned to the vehicle and found the the phone had tripped the Android alert for overheating. It had only been a half hour and the temperature was only 70F outside so it was unexpected. I have installed a logging app to keep an eye on the phone and will update if it turns out to be an issue}The configuration of the SIM card mounting is slightly different than the photos and at first seemed to jam up but once I followed the diagram imprinted on the phone it slid right into place.The stylus comes in handy for blocking the hole made for it but does not seem to work on the screen well enough to give up on finger poking.The spare cover looked good to me at first but the added screen protector flap would get in the way putting it into the dash stand when using for GPS. There was a transparent screen protector shipped with the device which I managed to install with only a dozen bubbles or so.The phone feels good to me and I like the mechanical ""Home"" button. I would be willing to spend some money to upgrade the camera if possible but it would probably entail tearing into the circuit board."
"star",2,"This phone is the perfect size but the camera is terrible. It doesn't receive MMS messages, I have tried everything ! I wouldn't recommend this phone."
"star",2,"the power button went out five mins after haveing it was a nice phone if it had worked , just got a bad one i guess but they got my refund to me write away"
"star",5,"Phone is perfect downloaded all the apps that i wanted, the speed is awesome still getting use to it will buy another"
"star",3,"I've only just received this phone a day ago, so I am still fiddling with it. Some small issues so far, such as - I have been unable find an N7100 case that actually will fit properly, the mic and headphone jack openings do not match the device. The included stylus does not work properly with the screen and there is no way to re-calibrate it, screen seems to work better with my finger. And, while it is great to include the extra battery, there is no included external charger, so it is useless to swap them. Unless, of course, you manage to find a compatible charger sold separately. Last issue, even though my carrier offers 4g service, I have yet to get 3g reception (this phone is suppose to be capable of 3g) even in the heart of town near the carrier's tower.On the good side, the phone was not $500 - $800 as you would expect to pay for Samsung's Galaxy Note II. I love the quality and functionality of Samsung's Galaxy line, but simply cannot afford the prices. As such, I will learn to live with this knock-off's flaws."
"star",5,"I love this phone I use it for net10 50 a month unlimited its just like the real Samsung it's unbelievable 4 core processor faster"
"star",5,"I'm ready to receive my phone hope its great .After I reveiew what ppl said about this device .... sounds like a great big phone "
"Android",2,"didn't work you could find your way i find mine"
"Yezz",1,"Very poor quality. Has the oldest version of Android on them, Bought them to take on a deployment. These were the slowest and I could not use them. Threw them in the trash. Dont buy."
"Yezz",1,"Had to return as it did not include the battery as indicated on box and description."
"Yezz Wireless Ltd.",1,"Very poor quality. Has the oldest version of Android on them, Bought them to take on a deployment. These were the slowest and I could not use them. Threw them in the trash. Dont buy."
"Yezz Wireless Ltd.",1,"Had to return as it did not include the battery as indicated on box and description."
"Yezz",4,"good"
"Yezz",5,"Super nice related with the price!!! Love it"
"Yezz",4,"good"
"Yezz",5,"Super nice related with the price!!! Love it"
"Apple",5,"Was a gift for my husband and he loves it. Replaced a first gen droid so there was no place to go but up.The phone came in a plain white box with charging cable. It looked brand new and unused.So far it has performed as a new phone with no troubles whatsoever."
"Apple",5,"Great price, extremely fast shipping works as advertized!"
"Apple",4,"Moving from Android to Apple...my kids have this phone too and keep me straight on using it. Phone is superb and, while Apple has its moments, it is intuitive to use. Seller was VERY responsive...only reason not a 5 star is ""new"" phone had been opened for imei verification. Not sure that's industry standard. If it is, seller is 5 star."
"Apple",4,"It is compatible with Verizon. Not pink but PEACH, pretty beaten up...but not bad enough to return. A descent value for anyone who doesn't want to spend a fortune on a phone!"
"Apple",5,"I love this phone! Thank you so much."
"Apple",5,"norm!"
"Apple",5,"I got this for my husband and he absolutely loves it."
"Apple",1,"The discription reads that it is a Verizon Wireless phone. However, I did not receive a Verizon phone like promised and was unable to use it. It is also a phone of much lesser value if you try to sell it."
"Apple",4,"Basically in the condition described. However, with no SIM card it could not be used out of the box."
"Apple",5,"This phone is GREAT! While I didn't hear back from the seller - the service was QUICK! Thanks!"
"Apple",3,"By mistake, I bought a wrong iPhone. It can not work outside America. The refund was 100%."
"Apple",1,"Purchased from CellMania. First phone spent 4 hours at Verizon and could not get activated. Verizon determined the antenna was bad. Returned to CellMania and they sent a new phone after 5 days. Second phone would activate but had no service at home only in town (my son and daughters iphone 5c and iphone 5s have no service issues). Returned second phone and requested a refund. Refund was received next day. Unhappy with the phone quality and the wasted time trying to activate. Refund was quick. Back to my old iphone 4s spoiled by the whole process of trying to upgrade ""cheaply"""
"Apple",5,"Great."
"Apple",2,"Although the sender was very helpful the product was not compatible with my carrier"
"Apple",5,"Great phone, works perfectly. It has a fast operating system, and I have had it for about a month and never had an issue with it."
"Apple",1,"It was supposed to be a verizon compatible phone but it was a sprint phone."
"Apple",5,"Great"
"Apple",1,"phone was locked - cannot use"
"Apple",5,"Very satisfied with the quality. This was the first time I'd bought a used phone and I'm very satisfied. The return policy and pictures made me feel better about ordering and I'm likely to do this again in the future."
"Apple",1,"Purchased phone SIM card missing and there was no sound. Quality awful! Response was they sell a lot of phones and tested does not seem likely"
"Apple",1,"After reviewing the phone and trying everything ywsteady to switch over to this phone it would not work. I ordered a new sim as well. Long story short, boh were a waste of my time and money and the phone did not come with a charger. The phone itself is in great condition, but was a waste for me."
"Apple",2,"Home button has a mind of its own working sporadically not very happy"
"Apple",5,"very good"
"Apple",5,"Works great!"
"Apple",5,"Received iPhone in a timely manner. The phone works great!"
"Apple",5,"Phone was perfect!"
"Apple",5,"Awesome exactly as described. Works great, no troubles, received quickly. Thank you."
"Apple",5,"bought it for a friend. works great."
"Apple",5,"It works like new. Got here faster than expected"
"Apple",1,"The first phone I received did not work properly and did not come in the original box as stated. This phone was returned and a new device was shipped out promptly. However, the 2nd device did not work properly either. The charger does not work and again, it was not in the original box as stated. Neither phone came with original accessories, as stated.When the charger for the replacement phone is plugged in, a pop up clearly states that it is not an original or correct charger. It does nothing for this phone.I will not be purchasing from this seller again."
"Apple",1,"Received phone on time and it was ready to be connected to Verizon.UPDATED: 4 months after I got the phone the screen stopped working. No touch screen. It was obvious when I recieved it that the screen had been replaced, I'm guessing it was cheaply done. Do not recommend."
"Apple",2,"The home button doesn't work and with all the money I paid for the iPhone 5c it's kind of a rip off"
"Apple",5,"the phone got delivered so fast & the phone is working great! I love it!!"
"Apple",5,"Nice phone for the price. Great for a kids first phone. Enough GB and good features at a low price."
"Apple",5,"Great phone"
"Apple",5,"Love this phone. Like brand new..no problems. Very happy with my purchase."
"Apple",3,"Minor, very annoying glitch when texting. Not a like new purchase at all."
"Apple",1,"Broke within two weeks and couldn't turn it back on!! Also time zone was stuck on Austria!!!!"
"Apple",5,"I got the phone in a very timely manner! :) It was exactly in the shape they said it would be. ""A few wear and tear scratches, but looks very good."" They were right, the back had a few scratches, but nothing that my Otterbox would not cover over anyways! :) The screen was perfect, not one scratch on it! I am NOT a technology person, and I didn't understand the ""No SIM card"" thing. I had no clue that it was a needed thing for my phone. However, I took my phone to Verizon to get it activated and they just gave me one, no problem, no charge. It was simple.THANK YOU VERY MUCH, for the great service and the phone. It was a great price for the item that I needed and I will be sure to come back to this company again for a phone in my future!:)"
"Apple",5,"works great"
"Apple",5,"Honestly freaked me out a little because it did not come with a sim card but I should'nt have expected that anyways. The seller gave nice institutions on what to do about getting a sim card and activating the phone. My phone is now activated and i am very happy!"
"Apple",5,"This shipped so fast and my son was so excited to receive it earlier than expected. Great condition phone and well worth the money. Thanks for the quality product and fast shipping - it truly made his day!"
"Apple",5,"I am very pleased with my phone. It was in great shape and has been working perfectly. It was also affordable."
"Apple",1,"First off this is NOT a verizon phone. I put the verizon sim card in it and it did not get any cell service. I contacted verizon and they told me the serial number was not a real phone so what is it?? Ridiculous. Second. It charged one time. And did not charge agian. The phone would not take a charge. It said charging, but the battery just went down. Better get a refund."
"Apple",1,"This phone is advertised as Verizon.. it DOES NOT work with Verizon accounts! Huge waste of time and money and had to be returned. Don't waste your time."
"Apple",5,"Very nice phone for the price I paid. Sorry for taking so long to sent review."
"Apple",5,"Gizmo trader took great care of me and the phone was described to a T down to a scratch on the corner......very good company and even better products"
"Apple",3,"home button messes up a lot!"
"Apple",1,"Great seller took back quickly. Phone like many won't work it's a version problem"
"Apple",1,"I do not believe I was shipped an Apple product. The rep at the Verizon store could not register the phone on the Verizon system. After closer inspection, he felt that it was a knock-off. I agree as the home button was not correct and was off center and the body of the phone had pulled away from the screen on one end. So far I have spent over 2 hours dealing with this phone. I did process a return for a refund and will purchase another 5C from a different supplier."
"Apple",2,"Phone was broken when I got it."
"Apple",5,"Fake shrink wrap but like brand new as promised. Happywith the purchase."
"Apple",3,"Phone works great but the screen was/is cracked when I opened the package..."
"Apple",5,"This has been great so far and works like a charm!!! Much better than the last phone I bought!!!"
"Apple",1,"Please contact me, when I received the phone the camera was messed up and the screen keeps poping out. Please contact me ASAP"
"Apple",5,"Excellent"
"Apple",3,"Great phone, few probs. Love that it's up to date"
"Apple",5,"I was verrrry leary ordering this phone thinking that it probably would not work and so on. Thank god Amazon has a great return policy! Turns out, the phone looked brand new!!! Arrived fast and phone works flawlessly. The phone I ordered was unlocked and I was able to put in international SIM card and works great!"
"Apple",5,"Love the extra memory. Try as I might I can not fill up the 32GB of memory."
"Apple",3,"It glitches really bad when on the charger. And it just recently started glitching even when not on the charger."
"Apple",5,"Love my phone! Works great!"
"Apple",5,"This phone has been my trusty helper for almost 2 years. It served its purpose. Now after hundreds of falls it is time to replace it..."
"Apple",5,"Arrived much quicker than I expected. Phone was perfect, I love it. The charger died soon after arrival, but not an issue."
"Apple",5,"Love it"
"Apple",2,"The phone works fine but it is more scratched up than anticipated. Also, both the charging cable and the wall plug that were sent with the phone did not work at all.."
"Apple",5,"5 stars."
"Apple",5,"I love it"
"Apple",5,"Excellent phone. Arrived quickly. Brand new as advertized."
"Apple",5,"Love the phone, plus I received it in 2days without paying for the faster shipment"
"Apple",4,"It is a bit slower than my last 5C"
"Apple",5,"This works great! Exactly as described, like-new in case with all accessories and even included a Verizon sim-card. Activated quickly with no problems. I've now had for about 2 months and it works like a charm!"
"Apple",4,"Package came fast and works fine it exactly as described. I honestly thought for the price I get ripped off but I did not."
"Apple",5,"Great seller. Very good item description including photos of actual phone being purchased. Kudos! Keep up the great work."
"Apple",5,"Works great. Came on time."
"Apple",5,"Came exactly as described. Needed a back up phone...wasn't sure about purchasing used iPhone...but so far, so good. Works just like my iPhone 6...flawless."
"Apple",5,"LOOKED AND WORKS AS I HOPED FOR WITH A REFURBISHED PHONE. SELLER ANSWERED ALL MY QUESTIONS AND WE GOT THE PHONE QUICKLY THROUGH MAIL. I AM PLEASED AND HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS SELLER :)"
"Apple",5,"I am in love with this phone so much. Service is excellent. It came right away and I am extremely satisfied of my new product. This here is an excellent price as well. Go to your carriers or even another party and the cost of this is like $600 which is bad. Not only that you have to pay it monthly. This was excellent and if my friends or family members need it I will be sure to direct them here. Thank you so much Amazon for putting a big smile on my face."
"Apple",2,"Great exterior condition. Screen is streaked with pink lines."
"Apple",5,"perfect"
"Apple",4,"I was really excited about this phone that is why i was willing to pay extra for it. The only down side is when it is charging it malfunctions if you try to use it while charging. The sender put way too much tape on the case, but all & all pretty happy with my phone."
"Apple",1,"When I received it, it didn't come with SIM card and the speaker in the phone didn't work, so I couldn't hear anything. It also wouldn't make a call. The phone looked in new condition, but unfortunately didn't work. But I returned it with no questions asked and the process was very easy."
"Apple",5,"Phone came in on time I bought it used and was surprised when it got here because it looked like new,I'm happy with my purchase.."
"Apple",5,"Awesome discription, condition and seller! VERY PLEASED, THANK YOU!"
"Apple",5,"The 5c is everything I except and more I would remind the 5c over any of the apple phones so far"
"Apple",5,"looked brand new"
"Apple",1,"the phone never gets fully charged .... and take all day to charger"
"Apple",4,"Great condition!"
"Apple",2,"Wouldn't hold a charge and wouldn't connect to WiFi"
"Apple",5,"Love the phone."
"Apple",5,"The phone looks like it was brand new, everything works perfect, no dents, no scratches. The shipping was really fast, arrived before time (USPS). also it's great that it's unlocked, it works perfect with my Mexican carrier (telcel), and I'm pretty sure I won't have problems using it in the US with t-mobile."
"Apple",5,"Great product!!"
"Apple",5,"Brand new in original packaging iPhone 5c with Verizon sim card."
"Apple",2,"It worked great for about a month and now every time I call someone my phone will mute me with out even touching it. When I go to unmute the call it locks me out. The screen will go black for no reason and it won't lock. To make the screen not black anymore I have to hit the middle button even if I'm on the home page."
"Apple",4,"If your looking to purchase then you know about IPHONES, except for the color, which i'am not crazy about the phone came without any visible wear or operational issues appears like new.For the price i'll put up with the color. Couple of details: the phone does not come with a charger only the cable, chargers are cheap at amazon, the other is that while this a Verizon phone I went to Cricket, they are owned by AT&T so they use their towers and got 2.5 GB of data and unlimited voice and text for 35 bucks with auto pay, AT&T is not Verizon but its good enough for me. They will insert their sim card and its ready to go."
"Apple",4,"I bought this phone originally for myself and the phone itself it great but it didn't come with a new SIM card so I had to buy a kit. That was my only qualm with this phone. The color is cute and the size is perfect; I love the new chargers, I got this phone after having an iPhone 4 and the charger was always breaking on me so this was a nice change. As paranoid as I am about dropping iPhones ( since I had a iPhone 4) I did drop this a few times before I could get a case and was pleasantly surprised that the screen held up! One thing I dislike about Apple products is the headphones, they are way too big for my ears and don't have good connectivity so I never use them and I feel as if they're going to waste! I did pass this phone onto my mother for an upgrade but I was also surprised when my mother ( a 50 year old non- tech savvy woman) came to me and told me she loved it as well! She found some of the apps to be too much but after she got the hang of how everything worked she really enjoyed it. She very much loves to use the FaceTime option."
"Apple",4,"Came in great condition. No SIM included and the information booklet was missing, as well as a few dints. However this was as expected so overall I am stoked!"
"Apple",1,"The phone that I got doesnt work!"
"Apple",5,"Exactly as pictured, Great Price, and of course a great product!"
"Apple",3,"The case was more beat up than expected. We had to remove the screen and unplug and re-plug the 3 screen connections several times to get it to respond consistently, but other than that it's an iPhone and seems to work; now the screen is failing more often and it is past the 30 day warranty, we will likely need to replace it or the phone. Big bummer"
"Apple",5,"Product works well so far No problems. Battery life seems to go somewhat fast but in on my phone a lot. So far it's good"
"Apple",5,"Great product ! Got in two days !"
"Apple",5,"Phone was in the condition described. Works great, no issues at all."
"Apple",5,"Great phone. No problems with the phone. In great condition.It was nice doing business with you. Well worth what I paid"
"Apple",3,"This is fine but they should put in the description that there's no sim card .-."
"Apple",1,"Buttons were broken in less than a month"
"Apple",4,"It was exactly as seller described and works beautifully ! Could not be more leased with it , and a good price."
"Apple",4,"i ordered a white iPhone and got a blue one... so I think that's a little unprofessional but other then that i like it."
"Apple",1,"If I talk on the phone for more than 10 minutes it dies then sometimes it dies even if I'm not using it..sometimes it can have 95% and it will die...The only reason why I haven't sent it back yet is due to the fact that my job requires me to have a phone so going even two days without it will disturb my job...so all day it stays on the charger even if I'm at work if I'm sleeping when I'm in the car if I talk more than two minutes it has to be on the charge so it won't die...physically the phone it looks great as described no broken screen no cracks is just the battery....then when I emailed I was told it can take four weeks or longer to get a refund"
"Apple",1,"I purchased this phone from cellcow through Amazon. The phone was a piece of junk. It acts possessed, randomly switching screens and typing without my even touching it. Save your money!"
"Apple",5,"The phone came quicker than expected and it was in flawless condition. I am so pleased!"
"Apple",5,"Great doing business with this seller super good deal quality products thank you"
"Apple",5,"I bought this for my wife for her birthday and she loves it hasn't had any problems with the phone"
"Apple",5,"Product arrived quickly, as described. Defective charging cable replaced immediately when contacted."
"Apple",2,"This may seem really ridiculous but I ordered this last week and got it Saturday. Before I got it activated the other night the screen was messing up on me. I was having a lot of fun trying to put in my WiFi information. Anyway, I got it activated last night and everything was working fine. But now it's back to the way it was before it was activated. The screen was acting like it was possessed or a chipmunk on rd caffeine. It kept going to comments or my messages or previous pages on the Facebook app and it even did it on the Safari app when I decided to just use Facebook on that. Still acted up. I was really looking forward to trying out Apple but I'm really disappointed. Even with that 9.0.2 update or whatever it is, it's still doing it. The phone itself is great but that touchscreen thing, REALLY needs to be fixed. As well as on their future models. The only other positive thing I can say is that it finally showed my music than my previous phone did (not an iPhone). It would show less than half of it even though it was all right on the micro SD card I had in it.I will try Apple again someday when it gets better hopefully. If not, it's either just not meant for me, I got a lemon, or I should just curse the fact that I have big fingers. Lol."
"Apple",1,"I bought this for my daughters birthday gift. I am having to send it back the day after her birthday. The screen backlight is jacked up. The touch screen does not work. I cannot even slide to unlock the phone because the screen won't work. Totally pissed and disappointed this is total bulls*** that i paid almost $200 just to have to return it and not to mention the sadness of my child that I am returning her birthday gift, and now have to wait to send this one back..... get credit...... order another...... wait for it to come in.....Waste of time and money."
"Apple",5,"I love this iPhone! The color is distinctive and it's easy to use. Everything I need right at my fingertips."
"Apple",3,"The product was in good condition, definitely what I needed, but it did not come in the original box as stated and neither did it come with the head phones but all that can be over looked since the phone was my main focus of the purchase."
"Apple",1,"I was delivered a 16GB rather than the purchased 32GB iphone."
"Apple",1,"Phone had severe hardware problems"
"Apple",5,"The iphone 5c i got was in very good condition. And was unlocked and it works perfectly fine"
"Apple",5,"This phone came on time and as it was described."
"Apple",4,"The phone works great. It has minor scratches as it was used, but works fine. The battery life is short lived and needs charging daily, but overall it's good. My only major problem is that the charger that came with the phone doesn't work. I've asked them to replace it and they did for free, but the second one still doesn't work. Luckily I have my old charger that I've been using."
"Apple",5,"It is a good phone"
"Apple",5,"Received as advertised: Verizon Wireless Apple iPhone 5c. Took it to the Verizon store and had them insert a SIM card and it works great. No complaints."
"Apple",5,"Works perfectly! Would purchase again from this vendor!!"
"Apple",5,"awesome"
"Apple",1,"The phone types by itself and freezes."
"Apple",5,"Fast Shipping! Phone Looks Just As Promised."
"Apple",5,"I got a great product that came exactly as the description said. 100% satisfied"
"Apple",1,"Received phone on time and it was ready to be connected to Verizon.UPDATED: 4 months after I got the phone the screen stopped working. No touch screen. It was obvious when I recieved it that the screen had been replaced, I'm guessing it was cheaply done. Do not recommend."
"Apple",1,"While the packaging was in tact, the phone itself was internally damaged and completely nonfunctional. It refused to even power up and got stuck on the Apple logo screen. I tried several different ways of resolving the problem myself over the course of several hours and nothing worked. After contacting Apple, I was told that we had exhausted all the options and that there was a hardware problem with the phone. Never even got it turned on. Very disappointing- I had very high hopes. I would have ordered a replacement, but I didn't want to test my luck again."
"Apple",5,"I wrote the review for this phone on the place for the green silicone case. This is my second Iphone 5. It is more phone than I will ever need."
"Apple",4,"I have bought before this one had a few small issues such as the ""P"" button not working when upright, but It is still worth the cost to me and beats the heck out of ATT."
"Apple",5,"Great phone everything works well great seller"
"Apple",5,"Nice phone"
"Apple",5,"Very pleased with the phone, condition, and price."
"Apple",5,"What I expected"
"Apple",1,"Advertised as New, but was not! The speaker does not work. Therefore Siri does not work. Not sure if anything doesn't work yet."
"Apple",5,"Phone came on time. The phone was exactly as described in post. I am extremely happy with my choice of buying the iPhone 5c."
"Apple",5,"I purchased this phone after not reading thoroughly, from another vendor and ended up with an unlocked iPhone incompatible with my carrier/ provider. Although disappointing, it was totally my fault. Luckily, I was able to return that phone and purchase this one. It is very important to educate yourself and read all of the product description before purchasing something like this. Although The previous vendor I worked with was fantastic with the return and refund process, I could've save myself the hassle if I just paid attention. Moving on, this phone is fantastic. It is completely functional, and works better than a previous iPhone I had purchased brand-new. If you are buying this iPhone and have not previously owned an iPhone, you will need to purchase a Sim card to activate this phone. You can get them for a small charge at your local Carrier/Provider/Apple store, or you can just order one here and save yourself the hassle. Again make sure the Sim card is appropriate to your carrier/ provider.I see some top rated reviews here indicating not to trust the seller. I have to say that the seller was absolutely phenomenal, everything arrived in tiptop condition and in all original packaging, with Apple certified charger and earbuds. I really couldn't be happier with the purchase. Just remember, be specific about your carrier. Also remember, unlocked does not mean compatible with server. Any refurbished iPhone you purchase will be unlocked, but if you have a Verizon carrier get a Verizon compatible phone, same with AT&T, Sprint, or whatever the case may be. The same goes with the Sim card, make sure it is compatible with your carrier. I cannot emphasize this enough."
"Apple",5,"5 star's"
"Apple",4,"The apple Iphone 5c in blue, has been my go to phone for the past year. I absolutely love the lightweight feel, and the ease of carry.However without a case this phone is very easily broken. I am a major clutz and have dropped my phone on the daily since I received it, but as it's been in the case during those drops it has sustained only one major screen shatter- when it dropped out of my pocket from two stories above ground.If you are familiar with apple, and want a reliable phone that is an older model, this is the way to go. Also according to my seventeen year old brother, it is a great starting phone.I'd Highly recommend."
"Apple",5,"there was a scratch on the screen, but it's little and in the corner; otherwise I love this phone and it worked for Verizon."
"Apple",4,"There have been a few quirks now and again but a solid tool, especially for those of us who are curious about a lot of things and need to be looking things up."
"Apple",5,"It's been @ least 2 months since I've had my new iPhone! When I say this phone that I'm doing this review on, is soooooo amazing!!! It's get 5 starts in all areas I can think about! The phone came in a timetable manner and the seller was VERY nice, she was amazing with giving me information on where my package was and etc.! Not only that but the phone came very clean and absolutely NO cracks or even scratches. It looked brand new and the speed on the phone is outstanding, battery life lasts all day I would find myself charging my phone only twice a day if I was on it from morning to before I went to bed. Now the phone came with JUST the phone no charger or headphones but that was no problem for me. I brought a charger the same day and I already had a pair of headphones from a friend with an IPhone! But overall if your having second thought you shouldn't because this was the best order I've had in years!! Thanks and much love 💕😊"
"Apple",5,"Arrived quickly and as advertised!"
"Apple",5,"iphone came in original Apple packaging and in only two days with standard shipping. Works with Verizon just like the ad says. New condition, no scuffs or anything. Thanks!"
"Apple",5,"works fine."
"Apple",1,"Received garbage its defeated phones"
"Apple",5,"Great product!!"
"Apple",5,"Everything went as planned"
"Apple",5,"Just the thing for a fella who needs something durable, relatively simple and affordable."
"Apple",5,"Excellent"
"Apple",5,"Bought it a year ago still very impressed!!"
"Apple",3,"These things are extremely brittle. If you were to purchase one I would highly suggest investing in a heavy duty case. I literally have gone through 4 in the last year and I treat it very carefully.Otherwise a nice piece of technology."
"Apple",5,"I've had it for about a month. I had no problems activating it with Verizon and it works like a new phone!"
"Apple",4,"The iPhone 5c I received is great. The charger and USB cable that came with it have issues. By trial and error I determined the charger barely works. The USB cable has a very small break in it at the edge where it connects with the phone port. It's a disappointment that I have to replace these items immediately."
"Apple",2,"According to the local Verizon Wireless branch, the Apple iPhone 5c that I ordered and received was not compatible with Verizon as the description indicated.As a result of the incompatibility, I had to cancel my Verizon wireless contract and pay the contract fee. I purchased the Walmart SIM card kit and their TMobile plan.All in all the phone works great. The compatibility issue was painful and costly to resolve."
"Apple",1,"This phone was NOT compatible with the Verizon network. I had to get a new phone and pay just as much for it. TERRIBLE marketing, don't believe it when it says it is verizon compatible."
"Apple",5,"Great phone till motherboard fried."
"Apple",5,"So far so good it worKS"
"Apple",5,"Great phone!"
"Apple",5,"Works great"
"Apple",5,"Great phone and great service! Thank you! Had a faulty charging cable and got it replaced with extras right away! Could not be better...."
"Apple",3,"This phone is stuck in the year 1970 and when I try to change the year it just keeps skipping over all of them.. and then the screen wouldn't work when I plugged it in with the charger.. really hope this can be a quick fix otherwise I'll be very disappointed...waste of my money I guess."
"Apple",5,"Great product"
"Apple",5,"Fast shipping. Great buy."
"Apple",5,"IPhone was in great condition! Better than described and over 100.00 less than most sellers. Couldn't have asked for a better deal!"
"Apple",1,"Does not charge or turn on."
"Apple",5,"Perfect condition. Barely looks touched. No scrapes, scratches or Knicks. It came completely cleaned out and ready for me to use. Charges super fast. No technical issues"
"Apple",5,"Great"
"Apple",2,"Didnt work with my Verizon account"
"Apple",1,"No... The phone is already messing up and I need the code to send it back and have it replaced with another one. Not happy at all!!!!"
"Apple",5,"Picked this phone up and was pleasantly surprised, it arrived in original iPhone packaging, all accessories included and not a scratch. I'd swear this phone was brand new perfect in every way including operation. Brought it to Verizon where they installed a new SIM card and activated the phone with contacts from an older flip model. Total time in store was about 15 minutes without a single issue. Logs on to our home network and receives a great signal and clear voice. All apps work flawlessly, not a single complaint, very pleased, highly recommended."
"Apple",2,"Phone works but didn't include SIM card and the speaker is barely loud enough to hear. I have to use speaker phone for any conversation!"
"Apple",5,"Great phone replacement for our other phone. Shipped fast and for a used phone, it works perfectly and there weren't as many defects on the phone as described. It was better."
"Apple",1,"Update: I am not blaming the vendor, but I did purchase an internally damaged phone from Cellular Trendz.Over a year ago I bought a white iPhone 5c on here from ""WeSellCellular"" and the phone was great and at a great price. I needed another cheap 5c so I got a green one from Cellular Trendz. Everything was fine except the battery life lasted a few hours even without me touching the phone. I am tech savvy and I've done numerous iPhone repairs myself so I bought a reputable battery here on Amazon. I opened the phone and I noticed one of the water damage indicators was red. Red= water damaged, white = never been exposed to water. I checked the other internal water damage indicator and it was also red. One of the screws that holds the battery connector in place was missing, but, it gets worse. There are RICE GRAINS inside the phone!! Not one or two random unidentifiable crumbs but multiple rice grains lodged in crevices of the phone. This leads me to believe someone water damaged the phone, removed the battery, and stuck it in rice.Good for a backup phone or someone who really wants an iPhone while on a budget. However, with the latest iOS 9 update this phone is slower than ever! Try and get one with iOS 8.4 or prior, but for long-term use I would go for a newer model."
"Apple",2,"Delivery was great, but the phone didn't make it to the new year. Completely blacked out screen with no previous damage done. Bout to head to dinner and no screen, no way to call out, text nothing. Owned the phone apx 4months..."
"Apple",5,"My son loving his phone thanks you guys"
"Apple",5,"Honestly freaked me out a little because it did not come with a sim card but I should'nt have expected that anyways. The seller gave nice institutions on what to do about getting a sim card and activating the phone. My phone is now activated and i am very happy!"
"Apple",5,"it works as a phone"
"Apple",5,"Thanks! Bought for a friend. She loves it."
"Apple",4,"The condition of the phone was good and had no problem with it but my husband lost it the day after he got the phone lmao 😩😩😩"
"Apple",4,"Like my new little iPhone. Apple said the program was bad why I cannot log into iTunes account an get apps."
"Apple",5,"Ordered this as a replacement for my son's phone that he broke. Had some issues getting it set up, but it wasn't the phone's fault, we just needed a new sim card. Once we went the store and got the card, it worked perfectly. We're both thrilled with it. Me, as I didn't have to spend full price on a replacement phone, and his cuz he can Face Time his friends again."
"Apple",5,"Super fast shipping. Seems to work great so far. Thank you."
"Apple",4,"came in on time seems to be working fine so far"
"Apple",1,"Wifi on device died within three months of purchase."
"Apple",1,"Bought this phone a couple of weeks ago and the phone will not hold a charge. Have to take it to an Apple store to have it repaired. Very unhappy about this."
"Apple",5,"Received a great looking and working used phone. No scratches. Check the specific sellers reviews first."
"Apple",5,"GREAT"
"Apple",4,"I bought this for my mother to replace the iPhone 4 she had been toting around for years. This review is a reflection of how she feels about the phone. She does love the bigger screen and the fact that it moves faster overall- but the battery does die way quicker than the 4's did. Even after I did lots of energy-saving settings modifications, it still dies to quickly for her liking."
"Apple",1,"My son is disatisfied with his phone. It does not consistently work. He isn't able to text or answer calls part of the time. Not sure if it just needs a new screen."
"Apple",5,"good phone unlocked"
"Apple",5,"Purchased from Bobcat Wireless and received a great Refurbished phone. Came in generic packaging, but had an Apple charger. Setup was tricky at Verizon but the dude got it done. This phone is basically an iphone 5 in Color...which is what the C stands for. It does not have Fingerprint Sensor or some of the added camera specs of the 5s, but for normal, daytime pix, this phone is great. The exterior is a tough plastic exterior around aluminum. The size is nice. If you are like me and can't stand the thought of holding a tablet to your ear, you will like the size and feel of this phone. The color is great. I bought this for my son, but honestly, I had a hard time handing it over. The green phone is a tad lighter than standard Minecraft green. Fellow geeks will understand. I went with 32GB. I don't recommend going with anything less unless you have the restraint to use only a handful of apps. I wish this phone had offered the 64GB option. This phone is fast. It moves seamlessly from songs to apps, etc. Apparently you have to set Siri up on this phone. I'll deal with that another day. But, very satisfied with this seller and phone. The phone did work with Verizon, although unlocked. And, the iCloud and iTunes information from the previous owner was completely deleted."
"Apple",5,"Great phones, great price. what more can I say"
"Apple",5,"Very thankful for these fine sellers. Needed a new-to-me phone for cheap. Phone works well---no complaints here!"
"Apple",1,"Phone with many issue. For one thing, not all the letters work when texting. Randomly switches screens. I'm not a high tech person and tried to live with it...ended up being so frustrated I turned it off and filed claim. However claim was a few days past 30 day guarantee and GizmoTraders wouldn't exchange it. SHAME ON AMAZON TOO because they advertised 90 day A to Z guarantee on this product which of course led me to believe they would guarantee a good resolution for problems of defective merchandise but that was not the case! They said said claim filed after 30 days...OUT OF LUCK and see our fine print!"
"Apple",5,"This phone was labeled to be in ""good condition"" instead of excellent or like new- it seemed brand new! No scratches or anything. Very pleased with this purchase."
"Apple",1,"Phone I received was registered on the Sprint Network, Sent Back."
"Apple",5,"love didn't come with sim card though"
"Apple",1,"It was not the product that was advertised!!"
"Apple",5,"iPhone was advertised as ""it still looks very much like brand new"" and it was! It looked great and worked great. Came without a Verizon sim, but I took it to the Verizon store and they gave me a new sim and got this phone on their network, replacing my older 4S with no problem. Kudos to Verizon, but many thanks to alexis for getting me just what I wanted. Shipment was on time too!"
"Apple",5,"It was great. Sucks that it didn't come with a charger though."
"Apple",5,"I purchased the phone from ""WeSellCellular"" listed in Good condition. I am more than pleased!! It is for my sister who breaks her phones like crazy. I did not want to spend a lot of money and this seemed like a great price for 32GB! It is from Verizon but it's factory unlocked- worked great with a T-Mobile SIM card and a Cricket SIM card (both got LTE).It got here in only 3 days or so (ordered Sunday night arrived Wednesday). The condition is much better than I imagined! Personally, I would list this phone as Excellent or mint. It's perfect except for one tiny scratch near the power button.The screen is in PERFECT condition with no scratches. I put a TechArmor glass screen protector on it and also an Otterbox Commuter.It came with a charger and sync cable which work as they should.The phone came with iOS 8.1.1 which was perfect for jailbreaking.Clean IMEI, no iCloud lock."
"Apple",5,"Daughter loves it the blue is very pretty"
"Apple",1,"Phone was glitchy, screen becomes unresponsive in the middle and you can only touch the top and bottom of it until you turn it off and turn it back on. Happens at least 20x a day if you open your phone 30x"
"Apple",5,"very happy with new phone fair price excellent condition"
"Apple",2,"The phone arrived promptly as it was a Christmas present. However, the screen began to lift two days after Christmas and the phone froze up. Returned the item on January 6, 2015 and waiting patiently for a return."
"Apple",5,"Was a gift for my husband and he loves it. Replaced a first gen droid so there was no place to go but up.The phone came in a plain white box with charging cable. It looked brand new and unused.So far it has performed as a new phone with no troubles whatsoever."
"Apple",5,"5 plums out of 5"
"Apple",2,"worked a whole 3 days. Power button was faulty."
"Apple",5,"I absolutely LOVE the phone, however, it was advertised as a VERIZON phone but when I received it and tried using it through my Verizon account, I was told by the customer rep that the phone I bought was for AT&T - not Verizon!!! I was so bummed... Even though I am a long-time Verizon customer (10 years now), I decided to keep the phone and just try AT&Ts service for a little while - oh my, what a BIG MISTAKE. To make a long, very negative story short and sweet, I ended up buying a VERIZON iPhone just like this one (blue, too) and IMMEDIATELY took my service back to Verizon; they only charge me $45 a month without a contract anyway. BUT... when my bill came from AT&T (only 3 weeks into my new service), they wanted almost $67 from me after telling me it would only be $45 from the beginning!!!! - HA - I'm not stupid and I refuse to be lied to, so that's why I changed back to Verizon with the same type of phone - because both Verizon and the PHONE rock!"
"Apple",5,"I already had an Iphone 5C but it only had 8GB of storage. I needed much more. I ordered this phone, it came earlier than expected. It was fully functional and had no problems. It also looks brand new. I've owned this now for a few months and everything is working fine. It offers plenty of storage. It was a good deal for the price."
"Apple",5,"I am extremely impressed, the phone was what I needed and is what I expected."
"Apple",5,"very nice iphone"
"Apple",5,"Works well Verizon network. Happy I got it!"
"Apple",1,"After one month, a chip on the logic board failed which controlled recharging the battery. Not Repairable. Had to purchase a new phone. I could have exchanged the phone with Apple for Ver5, but chose to upgrade to 6S and get a new phone."
"Apple",5,"Works as promised Condition better than listed."
"Apple",2,"The standing joke about the Apple iPhone 5c is that the ""c"" stands for ""cheap,"" not ""color."" The phone came with a sim card that you'll have to take to the Verizon store to activate. It also comes with a SIM port key, earbuds, a charger and the fun standard Apple icon stickers. I chose to purchase the green one, which was a fun spring green! It took two weeks to arrive at my doorstep, but the product booted just fine and worked for about a month. The processing is much faster than the iPhone 4, but in comparison to my mom's iPhone 6, it might just be worth waiting for the next iPhone to come out in the next couple of months. The ear piece stopped working after 32 days. I returned to the seller for a refund, but they charged me a 50% restocking fee. When it worked, the phone was nice and fun because of the color, but working with this vendor isn't worth it."
"Apple",5,"Excellent"
"Apple",1,"Phone was sold under Verizon as the carrier. when I called Verizon to activate the device they said the IME # was not a Verizon phone and would not activate the phone."
"Apple",3,"The phone seems to work well so far. But it was not a Verizon phone as advertised. I had to go with the less reliable AT&T network to make use of the phone."
"Apple",1,"First of all, this product sat on the shelf too long before I bought it; thus, when I took it to both Apple and Verizon to buy insurance, I was told ""the manufacturer date is too old for us to insure"", i.e., beyond 60 days. Since I knew the people well at my local Verizon store, I finally convinced them to insure it. But now it won't hold the iCloud password: it is either an internal phone problem or an Apple problem. I'm probably going to trade this in for a Samsung. This was my first Apple purchase and I am very disappointed. You may save a few bucks by buying online, but you will be better off in the long-run by buying local where the seller will stand behind their product."
"Apple",5,"came in on time works great!"
"Apple",5,"I love it. It only takes about an hr to charge it and the battery is good through the whole day."
"Apple",5,"Love my phone"
"Apple",2,"The phone came with a bad speaker I could return but not replace took it to cell repair place cost me another fifty dollars needed the phone.."
"Apple",5,"Works great!!! No problems at all."
"Apple",1,"I did not receive a Verizon wireless,as stated in the title, but instead a T-mobile wireless."
"Apple",5,"Great condition, looks and works like brand new"
"Apple",5,"iPhone 5 c is awesome. Would buy again"
"Apple",5,"Fantastic price and immediate shipping, could not have asked for more"
"Apple",1,"I did not receive a ""Verizon Wireless"" phone, rather an unlocked iPhone. The difference being that Verizon uses CDMA and unlocked iPhones only work with GSM networks like AT&T. In short, the phone will never work on the Verizon network and was a huge waste of my time and money."
"Apple",5,"Excellent ! Used phone! No problem to active it Love it!"
"Apple",5,"This was a gift."
"Apple",5,"Not only was the phone a great price but even more than that was the person that sold it to me. I will never forget her kindness and caring. Probably one of the best experiences I have ever had on any online store"
"Apple",1,"Not sure I can even use this phone as it's been reported as lost or stolen. Not what I would call a reliable retailer."
"Apple",5,"I still have the phone and no issues at all. Would definitely buy from this seller again."
"Apple",5,"I bought a white Verizon 5c 16Gb from K&K Reality Enterprises. Fulfilled by Amazon. Exactly as advertised. Hardware was fine and functional, no significant scratches on phone (I think better than the 8/10 they advertised, but that's all subjective), and device had a clean IMEI and MEID from a couple different sources. Using it on ATT w/o difficulty.Hope this doesn't drive the price up, as I might buy another(!), but in the interest of honesty, I'm pleased."
"Apple",3,"the charger doesnt work"
"Apple",5,"The iphone works great!"
"Apple",5,"The phone was like new, and works perfect, thank YOU!!!!"
"Apple",4,"I received the phone on time. The phone works really good, but there is a scratch on the back but its not really a big deal for me. I would recommend this phone and the apple outlet store. 100% satisfied on this phone."
"Apple",4,"Great price for working product in good condition. They did leave out the fact that you need to buy new sim card with this phone, which may have been common sense but it still would have been nice to know. The charger cord that came with it also quit working within a couple of days."
"Apple",4,"This phone was received as if it was brand new and excellent working order."
"Apple",1,"The phones screen broke right away, and just keeps cracking. The refurbisher did not do a good job. Plus the battery dies constantly. Hope others take the time to provide feedback so the rip off doesn't continue."
"Apple",5,"I'm extremely happy with my purchase. It was a present for my son. The price was great. The pictures weren't entirely accurate. My experience is that the phone that arrived was in much better condition than the one in the pic. I called and asked them to ship it earlier, which they did."
"Apple",5,"quick delivery, product received as described, very nice experience"
"Apple",5,"Wonderful ,quality phone delivered as promised ! I am completely satisfied !"
"Apple",1,"The phone I received was defective. The wifi function of the phone did not work. Thankfully, I had full insurance on my broken iphone that I was attempting to replace. Verizon covered the cost of this phone and provided me with a new one. Never again will I purchase a refurbished phone through Amazon."
"Apple",1,"Phone did not work properly. The store I used was quick to fix. All in all I am still a satisfied customer."
"Apple",5,"Just as expected."
"Apple",5,"I love it 😊"
"Apple",5,"GREAT PRICE AND REALLY GREAT PHONE....GREAT SERVICE AND I AM HAPPY"
"Apple",5,"I am very happy with the phone!!"
"Apple",5,"The phone was great it just seemed a little small to me then I upgraded to the iPhone 6 Plus and fell in love"
"Apple",1,"It was jail broken and couldnot be fix"
"Apple",1,"The damn thing was broken when it came to me"
"Apple",3,"By mistake, I bought a wrong iPhone. It can not work outside America. The refund was 100%."
"Apple",1,"Worked for 2 months now the phone earpiece doesn't work - they can hear me but I can't hear them unless I put on speaker."
"Apple",5,"I got my phone really fast and it was everything I had expected and more"
"Apple",4,"Phone came on time and it looks good"
"Apple",1,"Very disappointed!!! Speaker doesn't work can't hear when I call anyone or someone calls me!"
"Apple",5,"Very good condition"
"Apple",1,"didn't work."
"Apple",4,"Came in great condition, the only down side was the wall charger that came with it fell apart after about 2 weeks of use. But the phone its self works great!"
"Apple",5,"Very good condition. There was no scratches on the device."
"Apple",5,"Works fine"
"Apple",2,"Phone was broken when I got it."
"Apple",5,"works great, much faster than the 4s"
"Apple",1,"This not working very well the lcd about 1 month is freeze and no more working"
"Apple",5,"It was sent to me promptly . I am very happy with my purchase"
"Apple",2,"Cosmetically it matched the description. It took 2 hours to get the phone activated at the Verizon store. I was worried it was not going to work. The phone keeps freezing and I have to keep resetting it to get text messages."
"Apple",5,"Item arrived as described. Would have been a nice bonus for the asking price if seller would have included a car charger."
"Apple",3,"Have had the phone a couple months. Daughter dropped it on a carpeted floor from only about 3 ft away - cracked the screen. I doubt we'll be replacing it with another i5 as we hear that is a problem with them."
"Apple",5,"Lovely little phone I got after my iPhone 6 was stolen. Comes in fun colors, and everything I could ask for in a phone. Only thing that's really lacking to me is the camera, especially in low light scenes, not bad enough to knock off a star though. Besides that little kink, this phone fills the need of a digital life companion, and for the price paid, I couldn't ask for anything better."
"Apple",1,"Received iphone5c an was locked needs password to open did not say this in description"
"Apple",5,"She loves it like a newborn baby"
"Apple",5,"It's an iphone, what more does one need to say!"
"Apple",5,"Exactly as promised"
"Apple",5,"I was looking for a used iPhone with more memory than my current phone, at a reasonable price. This was perfect for that purpose.This phone arrived today, and so far I have had no issues getting it set up and moving my stuff over. The phone came packaged with headphones, a charger cord & adapter, all of which seem to work fine.This phone does NOT come with an SIM card. I was able to quickly move the card from my old phone over. If you don't currently have a phone with a SIM card, you need to purchase that as well."
"Apple",1,"The speaker did not work. I had to trade it to Verizon for $43 because my 11 year old son had been waiting to activate it. We took it in to activate it and it didn't work so I had to buy one at Verizon so as not to disappoint my son on his birthday, He brought his grades up to earn it. I was out $60 and got a phone contract I did not want."
"Apple",5,"New condition, worked for Verizon, & my son loves it!"
"Apple",5,"All was great!"
"Apple",5,"Absolutely met expectations. I was worried after reading some of the bad reviews but did not have the same experience as those. My package even came with the SIM card I needed. I got this phone for my ten year old son and am not activating at this time. But he can play games/apps and text other people in our family that have iPhones. I didn't think I needed the card to just do those things but I did!!"
"Apple",1,"It is an unlocked phone and I can take it to any carrier. However, BEWARE. It's a dud phone. So sensitive, it goes into Mute, Speaker or FaceTime when I am on all calls. When business Conference calls mute me as I am communicating, disconnects as I am receiving important information, I am losing valuable time (read money) getting back on track of a conversation with my refurbished iPhone. *Sigh Then 3 weeks after that, my cell phone does not ring for calls nor dings for msgs. It will vibrate though. I checked all the settings and notifications. Truly a DUD."
"Apple",1,"Speaker phone doesn't work, doesn't hold charge. Took it to Verizon store and they couldn't help. Returning for refund. Disappointed."
"Apple",1,"The Phone wasnt unlocked and wouldnt accept the sim card."
"Apple",5,"Works great!"
"Apple",5,"Great refurb phone at a fraction of the cost of Verizon!"
"Apple",3,"So, the phone itself is 5 stars. I needed a Verizon compatible phone and that's what I got. I removed my SIM card from the old one and set this one up no problem. I gave it three stars because of everything else.It comes with headphones, a wall charger and cable, but they were all different brands. The wall charger was some off brand, the cable was belkin but what was weird is that the headphones were really nice, dreys beats, the kind that go IN your ear, but they were used (gross)."
"Apple",1,"The phone came with ascree"
"Apple",3,"I have a strange problem with this phone. When it's plugged into the wall, some on screen buttons stop working."
"Apple",1,"I usually don't complain if something isn't too bad messed up, but this phone came with a really bad crack in the screen and a slight crack in the bottom. The back is also badly scrapped up! It didn't even come with a charger!"
"Apple",1,"The screen shattered in the first week, I have never had a cellphone break this easily."
"Apple",1,"nice price for phone but the motherboard of the phone sticks and i cant text or do anything with the phone. i thought i wait it out to see what else can be done for the phone nothing"
"Apple",5,"Great product, was almost brand new, just has some of that clear sticky stuff you find in ads, came off super easy. My mom had no problem activating it with Verizon, and to top it off it came early on Mother's Day! Just a great product and exactly how the seller described it. When I need another phone for my mother, which will be in about 6-9 months most likely, I am defiantly coming back to this person! Just great!"
"Apple",5,"5 STARS!!!"
"Apple",5,"Excellent price for an excellent product which arrived quickly and was exactly as described!"
"Apple",5,"Phone came in on time I bought it used and was surprised when it got here because it looked like new,I'm happy with my purchase.."
"Apple",5,"Awesome discription, condition and seller! VERY PLEASED, THANK YOU!"
"Apple",5,"The 5c is everything I except and more I would remind the 5c over any of the apple phones so far"
"Apple",5,"looked brand new"
"Apple",1,"the phone never gets fully charged .... and take all day to charger"
"Apple",4,"Great condition!"
"Apple",2,"Wouldn't hold a charge and wouldn't connect to WiFi"
"Apple",5,"Love the phone."
"Apple",5,"The phone looks like it was brand new, everything works perfect, no dents, no scratches. The shipping was really fast, arrived before time (USPS). also it's great that it's unlocked, it works perfect with my Mexican carrier (telcel), and I'm pretty sure I won't have problems using it in the US with t-mobile."
"Apple",1,"Iphone didn't work"
"Apple",5,"This shipped so fast and my son was so excited to receive it earlier than expected. Great condition phone and well worth the money. Thanks for the quality product and fast shipping - it truly made his day!"
"Apple",5,"I am very pleased with my phone. It was in great shape and has been working perfectly. It was also affordable."
"Apple",1,"First off this is NOT a verizon phone. I put the verizon sim card in it and it did not get any cell service. I contacted verizon and they told me the serial number was not a real phone so what is it?? Ridiculous. Second. It charged one time. And did not charge agian. The phone would not take a charge. It said charging, but the battery just went down. Better get a refund."
"Apple",1,"This phone is advertised as Verizon.. it DOES NOT work with Verizon accounts! Huge waste of time and money and had to be returned. Don't waste your time."
"Apple",5,"Very nice phone for the price I paid. Sorry for taking so long to sent review."
"Apple",5,"Gizmo trader took great care of me and the phone was described to a T down to a scratch on the corner......very good company and even better products"
"Apple",3,"home button messes up a lot!"
"Apple",1,"Great seller took back quickly. Phone like many won't work it's a version problem"
"Apple",1,"I do not believe I was shipped an Apple product. The rep at the Verizon store could not register the phone on the Verizon system. After closer inspection, he felt that it was a knock-off. I agree as the home button was not correct and was off center and the body of the phone had pulled away from the screen on one end. So far I have spent over 2 hours dealing with this phone. I did process a return for a refund and will purchase another 5C from a different supplier."
"Apple",5,"Love it:"
"Apple",5,"Brand new in original packaging iPhone 5c with Verizon sim card."
"Apple",2,"It worked great for about a month and now every time I call someone my phone will mute me with out even touching it. When I go to unmute the call it locks me out. The screen will go black for no reason and it won't lock. To make the screen not black anymore I have to hit the middle button even if I'm on the home page."
"Apple",4,"If your looking to purchase then you know about IPHONES, except for the color, which i'am not crazy about the phone came without any visible wear or operational issues appears like new.For the price i'll put up with the color. Couple of details: the phone does not come with a charger only the cable, chargers are cheap at amazon, the other is that while this a Verizon phone I went to Cricket, they are owned by AT&T so they use their towers and got 2.5 GB of data and unlimited voice and text for 35 bucks with auto pay, AT&T is not Verizon but its good enough for me. They will insert their sim card and its ready to go."
"Apple",4,"I bought this phone originally for myself and the phone itself it great but it didn't come with a new SIM card so I had to buy a kit. That was my only qualm with this phone. The color is cute and the size is perfect; I love the new chargers, I got this phone after having an iPhone 4 and the charger was always breaking on me so this was a nice change. As paranoid as I am about dropping iPhones ( since I had a iPhone 4) I did drop this a few times before I could get a case and was pleasantly surprised that the screen held up! One thing I dislike about Apple products is the headphones, they are way too big for my ears and don't have good connectivity so I never use them and I feel as if they're going to waste! I did pass this phone onto my mother for an upgrade but I was also surprised when my mother ( a 50 year old non- tech savvy woman) came to me and told me she loved it as well! She found some of the apps to be too much but after she got the hang of how everything worked she really enjoyed it. She very much loves to use the FaceTime option."
"Apple",4,"Came in great condition. No SIM included and the information booklet was missing, as well as a few dints. However this was as expected so overall I am stoked!"
"Apple",1,"The phone that I got doesnt work!"
"Apple",5,"Exactly as pictured, Great Price, and of course a great product!"
"Apple",3,"The case was more beat up than expected. We had to remove the screen and unplug and re-plug the 3 screen connections several times to get it to respond consistently, but other than that it's an iPhone and seems to work; now the screen is failing more often and it is past the 30 day warranty, we will likely need to replace it or the phone. Big bummer"
"Apple",5,"Product works well so far No problems. Battery life seems to go somewhat fast but in on my phone a lot. So far it's good"
"Apple",5,"Phone was in great condition and was able to be activated when received."
"Apple",2,"The home button doesn't work and with all the money I paid for the iPhone 5c it's kind of a rip off"
"Apple",5,"the phone got delivered so fast & the phone is working great! I love it!!"
"Apple",5,"Nice phone for the price. Great for a kids first phone. Enough GB and good features at a low price."
"Apple",5,"Great phone"
"Apple",5,"Love this phone. Like brand new..no problems. Very happy with my purchase."
"Apple",3,"Minor, very annoying glitch when texting. Not a like new purchase at all."
"Apple",1,"Broke within two weeks and couldn't turn it back on!! Also time zone was stuck on Austria!!!!"
"Apple",5,"I got the phone in a very timely manner! :) It was exactly in the shape they said it would be. ""A few wear and tear scratches, but looks very good."" They were right, the back had a few scratches, but nothing that my Otterbox would not cover over anyways! :) The screen was perfect, not one scratch on it! I am NOT a technology person, and I didn't understand the ""No SIM card"" thing. I had no clue that it was a needed thing for my phone. However, I took my phone to Verizon to get it activated and they just gave me one, no problem, no charge. It was simple.THANK YOU VERY MUCH, for the great service and the phone. It was a great price for the item that I needed and I will be sure to come back to this company again for a phone in my future!:)"
"Apple",5,"works great"
"Apple",5,"thank you"
"Apple",4,"Good phone. Some minor scratches but a case on it and you never know."
"Apple",5,"its still working"
"Apple",5,"Exactly as described. Works great. Thank you for expediting shipping for me!"
"Apple",5,"Nice color couldn't keep I was index a contract with my phone. I wanted this phone my son had to go through his plan under contract ."
"Apple",5,"works great! was able to take it to veroson and have it activated. Daughter loves it as a replacement for her phone that was stolen. Company answered questions and we received it on time."
"Apple",3,"Ad stated in mint condition except minor damage on the corner. That was accurate, however, a few of the keys don't work and this was a graduation gift for my son. Very disappointed."
"Apple",2,"Shipping was fast but the iPhone didn't work properly, they replaced it, which was great but that iPhone didn't work properly either. The mic doesn't work on calls, Siri or dictation don't work either. Tried to return the second one but got a email back saying my return time was expired, Amazon said I had told June 12 and I tried to return it before then!! Spending $200 on a phone that doesn't work is a disappointment!!!!!"
"Apple",4,"Great phone love it"
"Apple",5,"Excellent!!! The seller was great to work with!"
"Apple",5,"Love my phone! Works great!"
"Apple",2,"Home button has a mind of its own working sporadically not very happy"
"Apple",5,"very good"
"Apple",5,"Works great!"
"Apple",5,"Received iPhone in a timely manner. The phone works great!"
"Apple",5,"Phone was perfect!"
"Apple",5,"Awesome exactly as described. Works great, no troubles, received quickly. Thank you."
"Apple",5,"bought it for a friend. works great."
"Apple",5,"It works like new. Got here faster than expected"
"Apple",1,"The first phone I received did not work properly and did not come in the original box as stated. This phone was returned and a new device was shipped out promptly. However, the 2nd device did not work properly either. The charger does not work and again, it was not in the original box as stated. Neither phone came with original accessories, as stated.When the charger for the replacement phone is plugged in, a pop up clearly states that it is not an original or correct charger. It does nothing for this phone.I will not be purchasing from this seller again."
"Apple",4,"good"
"Apple",5,"My daughter loves her phone. Thankyiu"
"Apple",1,"Purchased this unit as a gift. When it worked, it performed great. After two weeks it lost network connectivity. When I tried for warranty replacement, I found out that this was not actually a blue iPhone; the original seller had taken a pink iPhone and put a blue cover on it. From Apple's perspective (or possibly Verizon's), this is a hardware modification which voids the warranty. Lesson learned...think twice before buying a phone from this seller."
"Apple",2,"The phone was advertised as being in excellent condition. When I received it there were scratches on it, the screen pops up in one corner, and all the accessories were fake with a mispelled word on it. I was very disappointed with this product."
"Apple",5,"Looks and works like brand spankin' new. The lightning port was loose, and they sent me a replacement stat! A+"
"Apple",1,"This phone is not Verizon! I did not get what I was expecting. I received a phone that is useless to me!"
"Apple",5,"Phone is like new, everything works great!"
"Apple",1,"Phone was received messed up more glitches than I can count"
"Apple",5,"The phone works great my husband likes it just fine not the charger I thought was coming with it but it's fine too"
"Apple",5,"Exceeded my expectations. It was like new and arrived very fast."
"Apple",4,"Charges very quick. However the battery doesnt hold as good of a charge as i would have hoped."
"Apple",5,"Great price, extremely fast shipping works as advertized!"
"Apple",4,"Moving from Android to Apple...my kids have this phone too and keep me straight on using it. Phone is superb and, while Apple has its moments, it is intuitive to use. Seller was VERY responsive...only reason not a 5 star is ""new"" phone had been opened for imei verification. Not sure that's industry standard. If it is, seller is 5 star."
"Apple",4,"It is compatible with Verizon. Not pink but PEACH, pretty beaten up...but not bad enough to return. A descent value for anyone who doesn't want to spend a fortune on a phone!"
"Apple",5,"I love this phone! Thank you so much."
"Apple",5,"norm!"
"Apple",5,"I got this for my husband and he absolutely loves it."
"Apple",1,"The discription reads that it is a Verizon Wireless phone. However, I did not receive a Verizon phone like promised and was unable to use it. It is also a phone of much lesser value if you try to sell it."
"Apple",4,"Basically in the condition described. However, with no SIM card it could not be used out of the box."
"Apple",5,"This phone is GREAT! While I didn't hear back from the seller - the service was QUICK! Thanks!"
"Apple",5,"Shipping took a bit, but the phone is in excellent condition and has made my life extremely easier. Bbrewer2 was very polite and got back to me quickly."
"Apple",5,"Fake shrink wrap but like brand new as promised. Happywith the purchase."
"Apple",3,"Phone works great but the screen was/is cracked when I opened the package..."
"Apple",5,"This has been great so far and works like a charm!!! Much better than the last phone I bought!!!"
"Apple",1,"Please contact me, when I received the phone the camera was messed up and the screen keeps poping out. Please contact me ASAP"
"Apple",5,"Excellent"
"Apple",3,"Great phone, few probs. Love that it's up to date"
"Apple",5,"I was verrrry leary ordering this phone thinking that it probably would not work and so on. Thank god Amazon has a great return policy! Turns out, the phone looked brand new!!! Arrived fast and phone works flawlessly. The phone I ordered was unlocked and I was able to put in international SIM card and works great!"
"Apple",5,"Love the extra memory. Try as I might I can not fill up the 32GB of memory."
"Apple",3,"It glitches really bad when on the charger. And it just recently started glitching even when not on the charger."
"Apple",5,"This works great! Exactly as described, like-new in case with all accessories and even included a Verizon sim-card. Activated quickly with no problems. I've now had for about 2 months and it works like a charm!"
"Apple",1,"Purchased from CellMania. First phone spent 4 hours at Verizon and could not get activated. Verizon determined the antenna was bad. Returned to CellMania and they sent a new phone after 5 days. Second phone would activate but had no service at home only in town (my son and daughters iphone 5c and iphone 5s have no service issues). Returned second phone and requested a refund. Refund was received next day. Unhappy with the phone quality and the wasted time trying to activate. Refund was quick. Back to my old iphone 4s spoiled by the whole process of trying to upgrade ""cheaply"""
"Apple",5,"Great."
"Apple",2,"Although the sender was very helpful the product was not compatible with my carrier"
"Apple",5,"Great phone, works perfectly. It has a fast operating system, and I have had it for about a month and never had an issue with it."
"Apple",1,"It was supposed to be a verizon compatible phone but it was a sprint phone."
"Apple",5,"Great"
"Apple",1,"phone was locked - cannot use"
"Apple",5,"Very satisfied with the quality. This was the first time I'd bought a used phone and I'm very satisfied. The return policy and pictures made me feel better about ordering and I'm likely to do this again in the future."
"Apple",1,"Purchased phone SIM card missing and there was no sound. Quality awful! Response was they sell a lot of phones and tested does not seem likely"
"Apple",1,"the home butten was messed uo , the white part had bite marks teh screen was crooked"
"Apple",4,"Package came fast and works fine it exactly as described. I honestly thought for the price I get ripped off but I did not."
"Apple",5,"Great seller. Very good item description including photos of actual phone being purchased. Kudos! Keep up the great work."
"Apple",5,"Works great. Came on time."
"Apple",5,"Came exactly as described. Needed a back up phone...wasn't sure about purchasing used iPhone...but so far, so good. Works just like my iPhone 6...flawless."
"Apple",5,"LOOKED AND WORKS AS I HOPED FOR WITH A REFURBISHED PHONE. SELLER ANSWERED ALL MY QUESTIONS AND WE GOT THE PHONE QUICKLY THROUGH MAIL. I AM PLEASED AND HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS SELLER :)"
"Apple",5,"I am in love with this phone so much. Service is excellent. It came right away and I am extremely satisfied of my new product. This here is an excellent price as well. Go to your carriers or even another party and the cost of this is like $600 which is bad. Not only that you have to pay it monthly. This was excellent and if my friends or family members need it I will be sure to direct them here. Thank you so much Amazon for putting a big smile on my face."
"Apple",2,"Great exterior condition. Screen is streaked with pink lines."
"Apple",5,"perfect"
"Apple",4,"I was really excited about this phone that is why i was willing to pay extra for it. The only down side is when it is charging it malfunctions if you try to use it while charging. The sender put way too much tape on the case, but all & all pretty happy with my phone."
"Apple",5,"Great phone greAt condition had a great experience and will be ordering from them again if ever need a new phone thank you"
"Apple",5,"Awesome first phone for my 9 yr old. Not too $$$ that if he loses it or breaks it, it will break my bank and the ease of iOS for him is good. Pretty study as well for his needs. Battery life is really good on these."
"Apple",1,"The headphone hole doesn't work."
"Apple",5,"Exactly what I was looking for! My daughter wanted an iPhone for her birthday and I didn't want to spend a fortune and this was just what I wanted! The condition was nearly perfect, it came quickly and it was exactly as promised!"
"Apple",4,"Like new, bought to use with tracfone and everything went smoothly, very happy with it"
"Apple",5,"Just as described. Due to my mistake, I had to send it back. I ordered the Iphone 6. Best value I could find. Great customer support. Wonderful to work with."
"Apple",5,"Good"
"Apple",1,"DO NOT BUY. When i purchased this phone it was sold to me as a NEW phone, not refurbished. It is clear now that the phone WAS refurbished and the battery only lasted a few month."
"Apple",3,"Not the best iPhone is to easy to break, but it is worth the money if you don't want to spend a lot."
"Apple",5,"The phone works great! Battery & screen are as new!"
"Apple",1,"After reviewing the phone and trying everything ywsteady to switch over to this phone it would not work. I ordered a new sim as well. Long story short, boh were a waste of my time and money and the phone did not come with a charger. The phone itself is in great condition, but was a waste for me."
"Apple",5,"This is the version of the iphone you want if you are an international traveler from the states. Either the iPhone 5, 5c, or 5S; if you don't get the factory unlocked version online, then buy the Verizon Wireless version only. Unlike AT&T and Sprint (DO NOT buy the Sprint model, they don't support enough LTE bands for international travel) Verizon sells their phones unlocked. With AT&T you have to go through a lot of red tape just to get it unlocked; not cool. If you decided to buy directly from a Verzion store, just buy the phone without a contract and go with a month-to-month plan. People think they are getting a deal on the phone by getting the 2-year contract, but in the long run, you will be spending WAAAYYY more than if you would just spend the money for the phone out right and go with a prepaid plan. You'll save a lot more money that way. Spend $500 now and have the freedom to go with any phone company you want, or spend about $2000 for the next two years? The choice is yours... >:D"
"Apple",5,"This phone has been my trusty helper for almost 2 years. It served its purpose. Now after hundreds of falls it is time to replace it..."
"Apple",5,"Arrived much quicker than I expected. Phone was perfect, I love it. The charger died soon after arrival, but not an issue."
"Apple",5,"Love it"
"Apple",2,"The phone works fine but it is more scratched up than anticipated. Also, both the charging cable and the wall plug that were sent with the phone did not work at all.."
"Apple",5,"5 stars."
"Apple",5,"I love it"
"Apple",5,"Excellent phone. Arrived quickly. Brand new as advertized."
"Apple",5,"Love the phone, plus I received it in 2days without paying for the faster shipment"
"Apple",4,"It is a bit slower than my last 5C"
"Apple",5,"Great product ! Got in two days !"
"Apple",5,"Phone was in the condition described. Works great, no issues at all."
"Apple",5,"Great phone. No problems with the phone. In great condition.It was nice doing business with you. Well worth what I paid"
"Apple",3,"This is fine but they should put in the description that there's no sim card .-."
"Apple",1,"Buttons were broken in less than a month"
"Apple",4,"It was exactly as seller described and works beautifully ! Could not be more leased with it , and a good price."
"Apple",4,"i ordered a white iPhone and got a blue one... so I think that's a little unprofessional but other then that i like it."
"Apple",1,"If I talk on the phone for more than 10 minutes it dies then sometimes it dies even if I'm not using it..sometimes it can have 95% and it will die...The only reason why I haven't sent it back yet is due to the fact that my job requires me to have a phone so going even two days without it will disturb my job...so all day it stays on the charger even if I'm at work if I'm sleeping when I'm in the car if I talk more than two minutes it has to be on the charge so it won't die...physically the phone it looks great as described no broken screen no cracks is just the battery....then when I emailed I was told it can take four weeks or longer to get a refund"
"Apple",1,"I purchased this phone from cellcow through Amazon. The phone was a piece of junk. It acts possessed, randomly switching screens and typing without my even touching it. Save your money!"
"Apple",5,"The phone came quicker than expected and it was in flawless condition. I am so pleased!"
"Apple",1,"When I received it, it didn't come with SIM card and the speaker in the phone didn't work, so I couldn't hear anything. It also wouldn't make a call. The phone looked in new condition, but unfortunately didn't work. But I returned it with no questions asked and the process was very easy."
"Apple",5,"Great phone greAt condition had a great experience and will be ordering from them again if ever need a new phone thank you"
"Apple",5,"Great doing business with this seller super good deal quality products thank you"
"Apple",5,"I bought this for my wife for her birthday and she loves it hasn't had any problems with the phone"
"Apple",5,"Product arrived quickly, as described. Defective charging cable replaced immediately when contacted."
"Apple",2,"This may seem really ridiculous but I ordered this last week and got it Saturday. Before I got it activated the other night the screen was messing up on me. I was having a lot of fun trying to put in my WiFi information. Anyway, I got it activated last night and everything was working fine. But now it's back to the way it was before it was activated. The screen was acting like it was possessed or a chipmunk on rd caffeine. It kept going to comments or my messages or previous pages on the Facebook app and it even did it on the Safari app when I decided to just use Facebook on that. Still acted up. I was really looking forward to trying out Apple but I'm really disappointed. Even with that 9.0.2 update or whatever it is, it's still doing it. The phone itself is great but that touchscreen thing, REALLY needs to be fixed. As well as on their future models. The only other positive thing I can say is that it finally showed my music than my previous phone did (not an iPhone). It would show less than half of it even though it was all right on the micro SD card I had in it.I will try Apple again someday when it gets better hopefully. If not, it's either just not meant for me, I got a lemon, or I should just curse the fact that I have big fingers. Lol."
"Apple",1,"I bought this for my daughters birthday gift. I am having to send it back the day after her birthday. The screen backlight is jacked up. The touch screen does not work. I cannot even slide to unlock the phone because the screen won't work. Totally pissed and disappointed this is total bulls*** that i paid almost $200 just to have to return it and not to mention the sadness of my child that I am returning her birthday gift, and now have to wait to send this one back..... get credit...... order another...... wait for it to come in.....Waste of time and money."
"Apple",5,"I love this iPhone! The color is distinctive and it's easy to use. Everything I need right at my fingertips."
"Apple",3,"The product was in good condition, definitely what I needed, but it did not come in the original box as stated and neither did it come with the head phones but all that can be over looked since the phone was my main focus of the purchase."
"Apple",1,"I was delivered a 16GB rather than the purchased 32GB iphone."
"Apple",1,"Phone had severe hardware problems"
"Apple",1,"Received phone on time and it was ready to be connected to Verizon.UPDATED: 4 months after I got the phone the screen stopped working. No touch screen. It was obvious when I recieved it that the screen had been replaced, I'm guessing it was cheaply done. Do not recommend."
"Apple",2,"The home button doesn't work and with all the money I paid for the iPhone 5c it's kind of a rip off"
"Apple",5,"the phone got delivered so fast & the phone is working great! I love it!!"
"Apple",5,"Nice phone for the price. Great for a kids first phone. Enough GB and good features at a low price."
"Apple",5,"Great phone"
"Apple",5,"Love this phone. Like brand new..no problems. Very happy with my purchase."
"Apple",3,"Minor, very annoying glitch when texting. Not a like new purchase at all."
"Apple",1,"Broke within two weeks and couldn't turn it back on!! Also time zone was stuck on Austria!!!!"
"Apple",5,"I got the phone in a very timely manner! :) It was exactly in the shape they said it would be. ""A few wear and tear scratches, but looks very good."" They were right, the back had a few scratches, but nothing that my Otterbox would not cover over anyways! :) The screen was perfect, not one scratch on it! I am NOT a technology person, and I didn't understand the ""No SIM card"" thing. I had no clue that it was a needed thing for my phone. However, I took my phone to Verizon to get it activated and they just gave me one, no problem, no charge. It was simple.THANK YOU VERY MUCH, for the great service and the phone. It was a great price for the item that I needed and I will be sure to come back to this company again for a phone in my future!:)"
"Apple",5,"works great"
"Apple",5,"Shipping took a bit, but the phone is in excellent condition and has made my life extremely easier. Bbrewer2 was very polite and got back to me quickly."
"Apple",5,"Excellent"
"Apple",1,"Phone was sold under Verizon as the carrier. when I called Verizon to activate the device they said the IME # was not a Verizon phone and would not activate the phone."
"Apple",3,"The phone seems to work well so far. But it was not a Verizon phone as advertised. I had to go with the less reliable AT&T network to make use of the phone."
"Apple",1,"First of all, this product sat on the shelf too long before I bought it; thus, when I took it to both Apple and Verizon to buy insurance, I was told ""the manufacturer date is too old for us to insure"", i.e., beyond 60 days. Since I knew the people well at my local Verizon store, I finally convinced them to insure it. But now it won't hold the iCloud password: it is either an internal phone problem or an Apple problem. I'm probably going to trade this in for a Samsung. This was my first Apple purchase and I am very disappointed. You may save a few bucks by buying online, but you will be better off in the long-run by buying local where the seller will stand behind their product."
"Apple",5,"came in on time works great!"
"Apple",5,"I love it. It only takes about an hr to charge it and the battery is good through the whole day."
"Apple",5,"Love my phone"
"Apple",2,"The phone came with a bad speaker I could return but not replace took it to cell repair place cost me another fifty dollars needed the phone.."
"Apple",5,"Works great!!! No problems at all."
"Apple",5,"Phone was in great condition and was able to be activated when received."
"Apple",5,"Great refurb phone at a fraction of the cost of Verizon!"
"Apple",3,"So, the phone itself is 5 stars. I needed a Verizon compatible phone and that's what I got. I removed my SIM card from the old one and set this one up no problem. I gave it three stars because of everything else.It comes with headphones, a wall charger and cable, but they were all different brands. The wall charger was some off brand, the cable was belkin but what was weird is that the headphones were really nice, dreys beats, the kind that go IN your ear, but they were used (gross)."
"Apple",1,"The phone came with ascree"
"Apple",3,"I have a strange problem with this phone. When it's plugged into the wall, some on screen buttons stop working."
"Apple",1,"I usually don't complain if something isn't too bad messed up, but this phone came with a really bad crack in the screen and a slight crack in the bottom. The back is also badly scrapped up! It didn't even come with a charger!"
"Apple",1,"The screen shattered in the first week, I have never had a cellphone break this easily."
"Apple",1,"nice price for phone but the motherboard of the phone sticks and i cant text or do anything with the phone. i thought i wait it out to see what else can be done for the phone nothing"
"Apple",5,"Great product, was almost brand new, just has some of that clear sticky stuff you find in ads, came off super easy. My mom had no problem activating it with Verizon, and to top it off it came early on Mother's Day! Just a great product and exactly how the seller described it. When I need another phone for my mother, which will be in about 6-9 months most likely, I am defiantly coming back to this person! Just great!"
"Apple",5,"5 STARS!!!"
"Apple",5,"Wonderful ,quality phone delivered as promised ! I am completely satisfied !"
"Apple",5,"Everything went as planned"
"Apple",5,"Just the thing for a fella who needs something durable, relatively simple and affordable."
"Apple",5,"Excellent"
"Apple",5,"Bought it a year ago still very impressed!!"
"Apple",3,"These things are extremely brittle. If you were to purchase one I would highly suggest investing in a heavy duty case. I literally have gone through 4 in the last year and I treat it very carefully.Otherwise a nice piece of technology."
"Apple",5,"I've had it for about a month. I had no problems activating it with Verizon and it works like a new phone!"
"Apple",4,"The iPhone 5c I received is great. The charger and USB cable that came with it have issues. By trial and error I determined the charger barely works. The USB cable has a very small break in it at the edge where it connects with the phone port. It's a disappointment that I have to replace these items immediately."
"Apple",2,"According to the local Verizon Wireless branch, the Apple iPhone 5c that I ordered and received was not compatible with Verizon as the description indicated.As a result of the incompatibility, I had to cancel my Verizon wireless contract and pay the contract fee. I purchased the Walmart SIM card kit and their TMobile plan.All in all the phone works great. The compatibility issue was painful and costly to resolve."
"Apple",1,"This phone was NOT compatible with the Verizon network. I had to get a new phone and pay just as much for it. TERRIBLE marketing, don't believe it when it says it is verizon compatible."
"Apple",5,"thank you"
"Apple",4,"Good phone. Some minor scratches but a case on it and you never know."
"Apple",5,"its still working"
"Apple",5,"Exactly as described. Works great. Thank you for expediting shipping for me!"
"Apple",5,"Nice color couldn't keep I was index a contract with my phone. I wanted this phone my son had to go through his plan under contract ."
"Apple",5,"works great! was able to take it to veroson and have it activated. Daughter loves it as a replacement for her phone that was stolen. Company answered questions and we received it on time."
"Apple",3,"Ad stated in mint condition except minor damage on the corner. That was accurate, however, a few of the keys don't work and this was a graduation gift for my son. Very disappointed."
"Apple",2,"Shipping was fast but the iPhone didn't work properly, they replaced it, which was great but that iPhone didn't work properly either. The mic doesn't work on calls, Siri or dictation don't work either. Tried to return the second one but got a email back saying my return time was expired, Amazon said I had told June 12 and I tried to return it before then!! Spending $200 on a phone that doesn't work is a disappointment!!!!!"
"Apple",4,"Great phone love it"
"Apple",5,"Excellent!!! The seller was great to work with!"
"Apple",5,"The iphone 5c i got was in very good condition. And was unlocked and it works perfectly fine"
"Apple",5,"So far so good it worKS"
"Apple",5,"Great phone!"
"Apple",5,"Works great"
"Apple",5,"Great phone and great service! Thank you! Had a faulty charging cable and got it replaced with extras right away! Could not be better...."
"Apple",3,"This phone is stuck in the year 1970 and when I try to change the year it just keeps skipping over all of them.. and then the screen wouldn't work when I plugged it in with the charger.. really hope this can be a quick fix otherwise I'll be very disappointed...waste of my money I guess."
"Apple",5,"Great product"
"Apple",5,"Fast shipping. Great buy."
"Apple",5,"IPhone was in great condition! Better than described and over 100.00 less than most sellers. Couldn't have asked for a better deal!"
"Apple",1,"Does not charge or turn on."
"Apple",5,"Received a great looking and working used phone. No scratches. Check the specific sellers reviews first."
"Apple",5,"Awesome first phone for my 9 yr old. Not too $$$ that if he loses it or breaks it, it will break my bank and the ease of iOS for him is good. Pretty study as well for his needs. Battery life is really good on these."
"Apple",1,"The headphone hole doesn't work."
"Apple",5,"Exactly what I was looking for! My daughter wanted an iPhone for her birthday and I didn't want to spend a fortune and this was just what I wanted! The condition was nearly perfect, it came quickly and it was exactly as promised!"
"Apple",4,"Like new, bought to use with tracfone and everything went smoothly, very happy with it"
"Apple",5,"Just as described. Due to my mistake, I had to send it back. I ordered the Iphone 6. Best value I could find. Great customer support. Wonderful to work with."
"Apple",5,"Good"
"Apple",1,"DO NOT BUY. When i purchased this phone it was sold to me as a NEW phone, not refurbished. It is clear now that the phone WAS refurbished and the battery only lasted a few month."
"Apple",3,"Not the best iPhone is to easy to break, but it is worth the money if you don't want to spend a lot."
"Apple",5,"The phone works great! Battery & screen are as new!"
"Apple",5,"Was a gift for my husband and he loves it. Replaced a first gen droid so there was no place to go but up.The phone came in a plain white box with charging cable. It looked brand new and unused.So far it has performed as a new phone with no troubles whatsoever."
"Apple",5,"Great price, extremely fast shipping works as advertized!"
"Apple",4,"Moving from Android to Apple...my kids have this phone too and keep me straight on using it. Phone is superb and, while Apple has its moments, it is intuitive to use. Seller was VERY responsive...only reason not a 5 star is ""new"" phone had been opened for imei verification. Not sure that's industry standard. If it is, seller is 5 star."
"Apple",4,"It is compatible with Verizon. Not pink but PEACH, pretty beaten up...but not bad enough to return. A descent value for anyone who doesn't want to spend a fortune on a phone!"
"Apple",5,"I love this phone! Thank you so much."
"Apple",5,"norm!"
"Apple",5,"I got this for my husband and he absolutely loves it."
"Apple",1,"The discription reads that it is a Verizon Wireless phone. However, I did not receive a Verizon phone like promised and was unable to use it. It is also a phone of much lesser value if you try to sell it."
"Apple",4,"Basically in the condition described. However, with no SIM card it could not be used out of the box."
"Apple",5,"This phone is GREAT! While I didn't hear back from the seller - the service was QUICK! Thanks!"
"Apple",5,"I purchased this phone after not reading thoroughly, from another vendor and ended up with an unlocked iPhone incompatible with my carrier/ provider. Although disappointing, it was totally my fault. Luckily, I was able to return that phone and purchase this one. It is very important to educate yourself and read all of the product description before purchasing something like this. Although The previous vendor I worked with was fantastic with the return and refund process, I could've save myself the hassle if I just paid attention. Moving on, this phone is fantastic. It is completely functional, and works better than a previous iPhone I had purchased brand-new. If you are buying this iPhone and have not previously owned an iPhone, you will need to purchase a Sim card to activate this phone. You can get them for a small charge at your local Carrier/Provider/Apple store, or you can just order one here and save yourself the hassle. Again make sure the Sim card is appropriate to your carrier/ provider.I see some top rated reviews here indicating not to trust the seller. I have to say that the seller was absolutely phenomenal, everything arrived in tiptop condition and in all original packaging, with Apple certified charger and earbuds. I really couldn't be happier with the purchase. Just remember, be specific about your carrier. Also remember, unlocked does not mean compatible with server. Any refurbished iPhone you purchase will be unlocked, but if you have a Verizon carrier get a Verizon compatible phone, same with AT&T, Sprint, or whatever the case may be. The same goes with the Sim card, make sure it is compatible with your carrier. I cannot emphasize this enough."
"Apple",5,"5 star's"
"Apple",4,"The apple Iphone 5c in blue, has been my go to phone for the past year. I absolutely love the lightweight feel, and the ease of carry.However without a case this phone is very easily broken. I am a major clutz and have dropped my phone on the daily since I received it, but as it's been in the case during those drops it has sustained only one major screen shatter- when it dropped out of my pocket from two stories above ground.If you are familiar with apple, and want a reliable phone that is an older model, this is the way to go. Also according to my seventeen year old brother, it is a great starting phone.I'd Highly recommend."
"Apple",5,"there was a scratch on the screen, but it's little and in the corner; otherwise I love this phone and it worked for Verizon."
"Apple",4,"There have been a few quirks now and again but a solid tool, especially for those of us who are curious about a lot of things and need to be looking things up."
"Apple",5,"It's been @ least 2 months since I've had my new iPhone! When I say this phone that I'm doing this review on, is soooooo amazing!!! It's get 5 starts in all areas I can think about! The phone came in a timetable manner and the seller was VERY nice, she was amazing with giving me information on where my package was and etc.! Not only that but the phone came very clean and absolutely NO cracks or even scratches. It looked brand new and the speed on the phone is outstanding, battery life lasts all day I would find myself charging my phone only twice a day if I was on it from morning to before I went to bed. Now the phone came with JUST the phone no charger or headphones but that was no problem for me. I brought a charger the same day and I already had a pair of headphones from a friend with an IPhone! But overall if your having second thought you shouldn't because this was the best order I've had in years!! Thanks and much love 💕😊"
"Apple",5,"Arrived quickly and as advertised!"
"Apple",5,"iphone came in original Apple packaging and in only two days with standard shipping. Works with Verizon just like the ad says. New condition, no scuffs or anything. Thanks!"
"Apple",5,"works fine."
"Apple",1,"Received garbage its defeated phones"
"Apple",1,"I did not receive a Verizon wireless,as stated in the title, but instead a T-mobile wireless."
"Apple",5,"Great condition, looks and works like brand new"
"Apple",5,"iPhone 5 c is awesome. Would buy again"
"Apple",5,"Fantastic price and immediate shipping, could not have asked for more"
"Apple",1,"I did not receive a ""Verizon Wireless"" phone, rather an unlocked iPhone. The difference being that Verizon uses CDMA and unlocked iPhones only work with GSM networks like AT&T. In short, the phone will never work on the Verizon network and was a huge waste of my time and money."
"Apple",5,"Excellent ! Used phone! No problem to active it Love it!"
"Apple",5,"This was a gift."
"Apple",5,"Not only was the phone a great price but even more than that was the person that sold it to me. I will never forget her kindness and caring. Probably one of the best experiences I have ever had on any online store"
"Apple",1,"Not sure I can even use this phone as it's been reported as lost or stolen. Not what I would call a reliable retailer."
"Apple",5,"I still have the phone and no issues at all. Would definitely buy from this seller again."
"Apple",3,"By mistake, I bought a wrong iPhone. It can not work outside America. The refund was 100%."
"Apple",1,"Purchased from CellMania. First phone spent 4 hours at Verizon and could not get activated. Verizon determined the antenna was bad. Returned to CellMania and they sent a new phone after 5 days. Second phone would activate but had no service at home only in town (my son and daughters iphone 5c and iphone 5s have no service issues). Returned second phone and requested a refund. Refund was received next day. Unhappy with the phone quality and the wasted time trying to activate. Refund was quick. Back to my old iphone 4s spoiled by the whole process of trying to upgrade ""cheaply"""
"Apple",5,"Great."
"Apple",2,"Although the sender was very helpful the product was not compatible with my carrier"
"Apple",5,"Great phone, works perfectly. It has a fast operating system, and I have had it for about a month and never had an issue with it."
"Apple",1,"It was supposed to be a verizon compatible phone but it was a sprint phone."
"Apple",5,"Great"
"Apple",1,"phone was locked - cannot use"
"Apple",5,"Very satisfied with the quality. This was the first time I'd bought a used phone and I'm very satisfied. The return policy and pictures made me feel better about ordering and I'm likely to do this again in the future."
"Apple",1,"Purchased phone SIM card missing and there was no sound. Quality awful! Response was they sell a lot of phones and tested does not seem likely"
"Apple",1,"Iphone didn't work"
"Apple",5,"love didn't come with sim card though"
"Apple",1,"It was not the product that was advertised!!"
"Apple",5,"iPhone was advertised as ""it still looks very much like brand new"" and it was! It looked great and worked great. Came without a Verizon sim, but I took it to the Verizon store and they gave me a new sim and got this phone on their network, replacing my older 4S with no problem. Kudos to Verizon, but many thanks to alexis for getting me just what I wanted. Shipment was on time too!"
"Apple",5,"It was great. Sucks that it didn't come with a charger though."
"Apple",5,"I purchased the phone from ""WeSellCellular"" listed in Good condition. I am more than pleased!! It is for my sister who breaks her phones like crazy. I did not want to spend a lot of money and this seemed like a great price for 32GB! It is from Verizon but it's factory unlocked- worked great with a T-Mobile SIM card and a Cricket SIM card (both got LTE).It got here in only 3 days or so (ordered Sunday night arrived Wednesday). The condition is much better than I imagined! Personally, I would list this phone as Excellent or mint. It's perfect except for one tiny scratch near the power button.The screen is in PERFECT condition with no scratches. I put a TechArmor glass screen protector on it and also an Otterbox Commuter.It came with a charger and sync cable which work as they should.The phone came with iOS 8.1.1 which was perfect for jailbreaking.Clean IMEI, no iCloud lock."
"Apple",5,"Daughter loves it the blue is very pretty"
"Apple",1,"Phone was glitchy, screen becomes unresponsive in the middle and you can only touch the top and bottom of it until you turn it off and turn it back on. Happens at least 20x a day if you open your phone 30x"
"Apple",5,"very happy with new phone fair price excellent condition"
"Apple",2,"The phone arrived promptly as it was a Christmas present. However, the screen began to lift two days after Christmas and the phone froze up. Returned the item on January 6, 2015 and waiting patiently for a return."
"Apple",4,"Charges very quick. However the battery doesnt hold as good of a charge as i would have hoped."
"Apple",5,"GREAT"
"Apple",4,"I bought this for my mother to replace the iPhone 4 she had been toting around for years. This review is a reflection of how she feels about the phone. She does love the bigger screen and the fact that it moves faster overall- but the battery does die way quicker than the 4's did. Even after I did lots of energy-saving settings modifications, it still dies to quickly for her liking."
"Apple",1,"My son is disatisfied with his phone. It does not consistently work. He isn't able to text or answer calls part of the time. Not sure if it just needs a new screen."
"Apple",5,"good phone unlocked"
"Apple",5,"Purchased from Bobcat Wireless and received a great Refurbished phone. Came in generic packaging, but had an Apple charger. Setup was tricky at Verizon but the dude got it done. This phone is basically an iphone 5 in Color...which is what the C stands for. It does not have Fingerprint Sensor or some of the added camera specs of the 5s, but for normal, daytime pix, this phone is great. The exterior is a tough plastic exterior around aluminum. The size is nice. If you are like me and can't stand the thought of holding a tablet to your ear, you will like the size and feel of this phone. The color is great. I bought this for my son, but honestly, I had a hard time handing it over. The green phone is a tad lighter than standard Minecraft green. Fellow geeks will understand. I went with 32GB. I don't recommend going with anything less unless you have the restraint to use only a handful of apps. I wish this phone had offered the 64GB option. This phone is fast. It moves seamlessly from songs to apps, etc. Apparently you have to set Siri up on this phone. I'll deal with that another day. But, very satisfied with this seller and phone. The phone did work with Verizon, although unlocked. And, the iCloud and iTunes information from the previous owner was completely deleted."
"Apple",5,"Great phones, great price. what more can I say"
"Apple",5,"Very thankful for these fine sellers. Needed a new-to-me phone for cheap. Phone works well---no complaints here!"
"Apple",1,"Phone with many issue. For one thing, not all the letters work when texting. Randomly switches screens. I'm not a high tech person and tried to live with it...ended up being so frustrated I turned it off and filed claim. However claim was a few days past 30 day guarantee and GizmoTraders wouldn't exchange it. SHAME ON AMAZON TOO because they advertised 90 day A to Z guarantee on this product which of course led me to believe they would guarantee a good resolution for problems of defective merchandise but that was not the case! They said said claim filed after 30 days...OUT OF LUCK and see our fine print!"
"Apple",5,"This phone was labeled to be in ""good condition"" instead of excellent or like new- it seemed brand new! No scratches or anything. Very pleased with this purchase."
"Apple",2,"Phone was broken when I got it."
"Apple",5,"Fake shrink wrap but like brand new as promised. Happywith the purchase."
"Apple",3,"Phone works great but the screen was/is cracked when I opened the package..."
"Apple",5,"This has been great so far and works like a charm!!! Much better than the last phone I bought!!!"
"Apple",1,"Please contact me, when I received the phone the camera was messed up and the screen keeps poping out. Please contact me ASAP"
"Apple",5,"Excellent"
"Apple",3,"Great phone, few probs. Love that it's up to date"
"Apple",5,"I was verrrry leary ordering this phone thinking that it probably would not work and so on. Thank god Amazon has a great return policy! Turns out, the phone looked brand new!!! Arrived fast and phone works flawlessly. The phone I ordered was unlocked and I was able to put in international SIM card and works great!"
"Apple",5,"Love the extra memory. Try as I might I can not fill up the 32GB of memory."
"Apple",3,"It glitches really bad when on the charger. And it just recently started glitching even when not on the charger."
"Apple",1,"the home butten was messed uo , the white part had bite marks teh screen was crooked"
"Apple",3,"the charger doesnt work"
"Apple",5,"The iphone works great!"
"Apple",5,"The phone was like new, and works perfect, thank YOU!!!!"
"Apple",4,"I received the phone on time. The phone works really good, but there is a scratch on the back but its not really a big deal for me. I would recommend this phone and the apple outlet store. 100% satisfied on this phone."
"Apple",4,"Great price for working product in good condition. They did leave out the fact that you need to buy new sim card with this phone, which may have been common sense but it still would have been nice to know. The charger cord that came with it also quit working within a couple of days."
"Apple",4,"This phone was received as if it was brand new and excellent working order."
"Apple",1,"The phones screen broke right away, and just keeps cracking. The refurbisher did not do a good job. Plus the battery dies constantly. Hope others take the time to provide feedback so the rip off doesn't continue."
"Apple",5,"I'm extremely happy with my purchase. It was a present for my son. The price was great. The pictures weren't entirely accurate. My experience is that the phone that arrived was in much better condition than the one in the pic. I called and asked them to ship it earlier, which they did."
"Apple",5,"quick delivery, product received as described, very nice experience"
"Apple",5,"Love my phone! Works great!"
"Apple",5,"This phone has been my trusty helper for almost 2 years. It served its purpose. Now after hundreds of falls it is time to replace it..."
"Apple",5,"Arrived much quicker than I expected. Phone was perfect, I love it. The charger died soon after arrival, but not an issue."
"Apple",5,"Love it"
"Apple",2,"The phone works fine but it is more scratched up than anticipated. Also, both the charging cable and the wall plug that were sent with the phone did not work at all.."
"Apple",5,"5 stars."
"Apple",5,"I love it"
"Apple",5,"Excellent phone. Arrived quickly. Brand new as advertized."
"Apple",5,"Love the phone, plus I received it in 2days without paying for the faster shipment"
"Apple",4,"It is a bit slower than my last 5C"
"Apple",5,"Perfect condition. Barely looks touched. No scrapes, scratches or Knicks. It came completely cleaned out and ready for me to use. Charges super fast. No technical issues"
"Apple",5,"Great"
"Apple",2,"Didnt work with my Verizon account"
"Apple",1,"No... The phone is already messing up and I need the code to send it back and have it replaced with another one. Not happy at all!!!!"
"Apple",5,"Picked this phone up and was pleasantly surprised, it arrived in original iPhone packaging, all accessories included and not a scratch. I'd swear this phone was brand new perfect in every way including operation. Brought it to Verizon where they installed a new SIM card and activated the phone with contacts from an older flip model. Total time in store was about 15 minutes without a single issue. Logs on to our home network and receives a great signal and clear voice. All apps work flawlessly, not a single complaint, very pleased, highly recommended."
"Apple",2,"Phone works but didn't include SIM card and the speaker is barely loud enough to hear. I have to use speaker phone for any conversation!"
"Apple",5,"Great phone replacement for our other phone. Shipped fast and for a used phone, it works perfectly and there weren't as many defects on the phone as described. It was better."
"Apple",1,"Update: I am not blaming the vendor, but I did purchase an internally damaged phone from Cellular Trendz.Over a year ago I bought a white iPhone 5c on here from ""WeSellCellular"" and the phone was great and at a great price. I needed another cheap 5c so I got a green one from Cellular Trendz. Everything was fine except the battery life lasted a few hours even without me touching the phone. I am tech savvy and I've done numerous iPhone repairs myself so I bought a reputable battery here on Amazon. I opened the phone and I noticed one of the water damage indicators was red. Red= water damaged, white = never been exposed to water. I checked the other internal water damage indicator and it was also red. One of the screws that holds the battery connector in place was missing, but, it gets worse. There are RICE GRAINS inside the phone!! Not one or two random unidentifiable crumbs but multiple rice grains lodged in crevices of the phone. This leads me to believe someone water damaged the phone, removed the battery, and stuck it in rice.Good for a backup phone or someone who really wants an iPhone while on a budget. However, with the latest iOS 9 update this phone is slower than ever! Try and get one with iOS 8.4 or prior, but for long-term use I would go for a newer model."
"Apple",2,"Delivery was great, but the phone didn't make it to the new year. Completely blacked out screen with no previous damage done. Bout to head to dinner and no screen, no way to call out, text nothing. Owned the phone apx 4months..."
"Apple",5,"My son loving his phone thanks you guys"
"Apple",5,"Brand new in original packaging iPhone 5c with Verizon sim card."
"Apple",2,"It worked great for about a month and now every time I call someone my phone will mute me with out even touching it. When I go to unmute the call it locks me out. The screen will go black for no reason and it won't lock. To make the screen not black anymore I have to hit the middle button even if I'm on the home page."
"Apple",4,"If your looking to purchase then you know about IPHONES, except for the color, which i'am not crazy about the phone came without any visible wear or operational issues appears like new.For the price i'll put up with the color. Couple of details: the phone does not come with a charger only the cable, chargers are cheap at amazon, the other is that while this a Verizon phone I went to Cricket, they are owned by AT&T so they use their towers and got 2.5 GB of data and unlimited voice and text for 35 bucks with auto pay, AT&T is not Verizon but its good enough for me. They will insert their sim card and its ready to go."
"Apple",4,"I bought this phone originally for myself and the phone itself it great but it didn't come with a new SIM card so I had to buy a kit. That was my only qualm with this phone. The color is cute and the size is perfect; I love the new chargers, I got this phone after having an iPhone 4 and the charger was always breaking on me so this was a nice change. As paranoid as I am about dropping iPhones ( since I had a iPhone 4) I did drop this a few times before I could get a case and was pleasantly surprised that the screen held up! One thing I dislike about Apple products is the headphones, they are way too big for my ears and don't have good connectivity so I never use them and I feel as if they're going to waste! I did pass this phone onto my mother for an upgrade but I was also surprised when my mother ( a 50 year old non- tech savvy woman) came to me and told me she loved it as well! She found some of the apps to be too much but after she got the hang of how everything worked she really enjoyed it. She very much loves to use the FaceTime option."
"Apple",4,"Came in great condition. No SIM included and the information booklet was missing, as well as a few dints. However this was as expected so overall I am stoked!"
"Apple",1,"The phone that I got doesnt work!"
"Apple",5,"Exactly as pictured, Great Price, and of course a great product!"
"Apple",3,"The case was more beat up than expected. We had to remove the screen and unplug and re-plug the 3 screen connections several times to get it to respond consistently, but other than that it's an iPhone and seems to work; now the screen is failing more often and it is past the 30 day warranty, we will likely need to replace it or the phone. Big bummer"
"Apple",5,"Product works well so far No problems. Battery life seems to go somewhat fast but in on my phone a lot. So far it's good"
"Apple",5,"Phone was in great condition and was able to be activated when received."
"Apple",5,"works great, much faster than the 4s"
"Apple",1,"This not working very well the lcd about 1 month is freeze and no more working"
"Apple",5,"It was sent to me promptly . I am very happy with my purchase"
"Apple",2,"Cosmetically it matched the description. It took 2 hours to get the phone activated at the Verizon store. I was worried it was not going to work. The phone keeps freezing and I have to keep resetting it to get text messages."
"Apple",5,"Item arrived as described. Would have been a nice bonus for the asking price if seller would have included a car charger."
"Apple",3,"Have had the phone a couple months. Daughter dropped it on a carpeted floor from only about 3 ft away - cracked the screen. I doubt we'll be replacing it with another i5 as we hear that is a problem with them."
"Apple",5,"Lovely little phone I got after my iPhone 6 was stolen. Comes in fun colors, and everything I could ask for in a phone. Only thing that's really lacking to me is the camera, especially in low light scenes, not bad enough to knock off a star though. Besides that little kink, this phone fills the need of a digital life companion, and for the price paid, I couldn't ask for anything better."
"Apple",1,"Received iphone5c an was locked needs password to open did not say this in description"
"Apple",5,"She loves it like a newborn baby"
"Apple",5,"It's an iphone, what more does one need to say!"
"Apple",5,"Phone came in on time I bought it used and was surprised when it got here because it looked like new,I'm happy with my purchase.."
"Apple",5,"Awesome discription, condition and seller! VERY PLEASED, THANK YOU!"
"Apple",5,"The 5c is everything I except and more I would remind the 5c over any of the apple phones so far"
"Apple",5,"looked brand new"
"Apple",1,"the phone never gets fully charged .... and take all day to charger"
"Apple",4,"Great condition!"
"Apple",2,"Wouldn't hold a charge and wouldn't connect to WiFi"
"Apple",5,"Love the phone."
"Apple",5,"The phone looks like it was brand new, everything works perfect, no dents, no scratches. The shipping was really fast, arrived before time (USPS). also it's great that it's unlocked, it works perfect with my Mexican carrier (telcel), and I'm pretty sure I won't have problems using it in the US with t-mobile."
"Apple",1,"Iphone didn't work"
"Apple",5,"This shipped so fast and my son was so excited to receive it earlier than expected. Great condition phone and well worth the money. Thanks for the quality product and fast shipping - it truly made his day!"
"Apple",5,"I am very pleased with my phone. It was in great shape and has been working perfectly. It was also affordable."
"Apple",1,"First off this is NOT a verizon phone. I put the verizon sim card in it and it did not get any cell service. I contacted verizon and they told me the serial number was not a real phone so what is it?? Ridiculous. Second. It charged one time. And did not charge agian. The phone would not take a charge. It said charging, but the battery just went down. Better get a refund."
"Apple",1,"This phone is advertised as Verizon.. it DOES NOT work with Verizon accounts! Huge waste of time and money and had to be returned. Don't waste your time."
"Apple",5,"Very nice phone for the price I paid. Sorry for taking so long to sent review."
"Apple",5,"Gizmo trader took great care of me and the phone was described to a T down to a scratch on the corner......very good company and even better products"
"Apple",3,"home button messes up a lot!"
"Apple",1,"Great seller took back quickly. Phone like many won't work it's a version problem"
"Apple",1,"I do not believe I was shipped an Apple product. The rep at the Verizon store could not register the phone on the Verizon system. After closer inspection, he felt that it was a knock-off. I agree as the home button was not correct and was off center and the body of the phone had pulled away from the screen on one end. So far I have spent over 2 hours dealing with this phone. I did process a return for a refund and will purchase another 5C from a different supplier."
"Apple",5,"Love it:"
"Apple",5,"This phone came on time and as it was described."
"Apple",4,"The phone works great. It has minor scratches as it was used, but works fine. The battery life is short lived and needs charging daily, but overall it's good. My only major problem is that the charger that came with the phone doesn't work. I've asked them to replace it and they did for free, but the second one still doesn't work. Luckily I have my old charger that I've been using."
"Apple",5,"It is a good phone"
"Apple",5,"Received as advertised: Verizon Wireless Apple iPhone 5c. Took it to the Verizon store and had them insert a SIM card and it works great. No complaints."
"Apple",5,"Works perfectly! Would purchase again from this vendor!!"
"Apple",5,"awesome"
"Apple",1,"The phone types by itself and freezes."
"Apple",5,"Fast Shipping! Phone Looks Just As Promised."
"Apple",5,"I got a great product that came exactly as the description said. 100% satisfied"
"Apple",1,"Received phone on time and it was ready to be connected to Verizon.UPDATED: 4 months after I got the phone the screen stopped working. No touch screen. It was obvious when I recieved it that the screen had been replaced, I'm guessing it was cheaply done. Do not recommend."
"Apple",1,"Worked for 2 months now the phone earpiece doesn't work - they can hear me but I can't hear them unless I put on speaker."
"Apple",5,"I got my phone really fast and it was everything I had expected and more"
"Apple",4,"Phone came on time and it looks good"
"Apple",1,"Very disappointed!!! Speaker doesn't work can't hear when I call anyone or someone calls me!"
"Apple",5,"Very good condition"
"Apple",1,"didn't work."
"Apple",4,"Came in great condition, the only down side was the wall charger that came with it fell apart after about 2 weeks of use. But the phone its self works great!"
"Apple",5,"Very good condition. There was no scratches on the device."
"Apple",5,"Works fine"
"Apple",2,"Phone was broken when I got it."
"Apple",2,"Home button has a mind of its own working sporadically not very happy"
"Apple",5,"very good"
"Apple",5,"Works great!"
"Apple",5,"Received iPhone in a timely manner. The phone works great!"
"Apple",5,"Phone was perfect!"
"Apple",5,"Awesome exactly as described. Works great, no troubles, received quickly. Thank you."
"Apple",5,"bought it for a friend. works great."
"Apple",5,"It works like new. Got here faster than expected"
"Apple",1,"The first phone I received did not work properly and did not come in the original box as stated. This phone was returned and a new device was shipped out promptly. However, the 2nd device did not work properly either. The charger does not work and again, it was not in the original box as stated. Neither phone came with original accessories, as stated.When the charger for the replacement phone is plugged in, a pop up clearly states that it is not an original or correct charger. It does nothing for this phone.I will not be purchasing from this seller again."
"Apple",4,"good"
"Apple",5,"My daughter loves her phone. Thankyiu"
"Apple",1,"Purchased this unit as a gift. When it worked, it performed great. After two weeks it lost network connectivity. When I tried for warranty replacement, I found out that this was not actually a blue iPhone; the original seller had taken a pink iPhone and put a blue cover on it. From Apple's perspective (or possibly Verizon's), this is a hardware modification which voids the warranty. Lesson learned...think twice before buying a phone from this seller."
"Apple",2,"The phone was advertised as being in excellent condition. When I received it there were scratches on it, the screen pops up in one corner, and all the accessories were fake with a mispelled word on it. I was very disappointed with this product."
"Apple",5,"Looks and works like brand spankin' new. The lightning port was loose, and they sent me a replacement stat! A+"
"Apple",1,"This phone is not Verizon! I did not get what I was expecting. I received a phone that is useless to me!"
"Apple",5,"Phone is like new, everything works great!"
"Apple",1,"Phone was received messed up more glitches than I can count"
"Apple",5,"The phone works great my husband likes it just fine not the charger I thought was coming with it but it's fine too"
"Apple",5,"Exceeded my expectations. It was like new and arrived very fast."
"Apple",4,"Charges very quick. However the battery doesnt hold as good of a charge as i would have hoped."
"Apple",4,"Package came fast and works fine it exactly as described. I honestly thought for the price I get ripped off but I did not."
"Apple",5,"Great seller. Very good item description including photos of actual phone being purchased. Kudos! Keep up the great work."
"Apple",5,"Works great. Came on time."
"Apple",5,"Came exactly as described. Needed a back up phone...wasn't sure about purchasing used iPhone...but so far, so good. Works just like my iPhone 6...flawless."
"Apple",5,"LOOKED AND WORKS AS I HOPED FOR WITH A REFURBISHED PHONE. SELLER ANSWERED ALL MY QUESTIONS AND WE GOT THE PHONE QUICKLY THROUGH MAIL. I AM PLEASED AND HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS SELLER :)"
"Apple",5,"I am in love with this phone so much. Service is excellent. It came right away and I am extremely satisfied of my new product. This here is an excellent price as well. Go to your carriers or even another party and the cost of this is like $600 which is bad. Not only that you have to pay it monthly. This was excellent and if my friends or family members need it I will be sure to direct them here. Thank you so much Amazon for putting a big smile on my face."
"Apple",2,"Great exterior condition. Screen is streaked with pink lines."
"Apple",5,"perfect"
"Apple",4,"I was really excited about this phone that is why i was willing to pay extra for it. The only down side is when it is charging it malfunctions if you try to use it while charging. The sender put way too much tape on the case, but all & all pretty happy with my phone."
"Apple",5,"Great phone greAt condition had a great experience and will be ordering from them again if ever need a new phone thank you"
"Apple",1,"While the packaging was in tact, the phone itself was internally damaged and completely nonfunctional. It refused to even power up and got stuck on the Apple logo screen. I tried several different ways of resolving the problem myself over the course of several hours and nothing worked. After contacting Apple, I was told that we had exhausted all the options and that there was a hardware problem with the phone. Never even got it turned on. Very disappointing- I had very high hopes. I would have ordered a replacement, but I didn't want to test my luck again."
"Apple",5,"I wrote the review for this phone on the place for the green silicone case. This is my second Iphone 5. It is more phone than I will ever need."
"Apple",4,"I have bought before this one had a few small issues such as the ""P"" button not working when upright, but It is still worth the cost to me and beats the heck out of ATT."
"Apple",5,"Great phone everything works well great seller"
"Apple",5,"Nice phone"
"Apple",5,"Very pleased with the phone, condition, and price."
"Apple",5,"What I expected"
"Apple",1,"Advertised as New, but was not! The speaker does not work. Therefore Siri does not work. Not sure if anything doesn't work yet."
"Apple",5,"Phone came on time. The phone was exactly as described in post. I am extremely happy with my choice of buying the iPhone 5c."
"Apple",5,"I purchased this phone after not reading thoroughly, from another vendor and ended up with an unlocked iPhone incompatible with my carrier/ provider. Although disappointing, it was totally my fault. Luckily, I was able to return that phone and purchase this one. It is very important to educate yourself and read all of the product description before purchasing something like this. Although The previous vendor I worked with was fantastic with the return and refund process, I could've save myself the hassle if I just paid attention. Moving on, this phone is fantastic. It is completely functional, and works better than a previous iPhone I had purchased brand-new. If you are buying this iPhone and have not previously owned an iPhone, you will need to purchase a Sim card to activate this phone. You can get them for a small charge at your local Carrier/Provider/Apple store, or you can just order one here and save yourself the hassle. Again make sure the Sim card is appropriate to your carrier/ provider.I see some top rated reviews here indicating not to trust the seller. I have to say that the seller was absolutely phenomenal, everything arrived in tiptop condition and in all original packaging, with Apple certified charger and earbuds. I really couldn't be happier with the purchase. Just remember, be specific about your carrier. Also remember, unlocked does not mean compatible with server. Any refurbished iPhone you purchase will be unlocked, but if you have a Verizon carrier get a Verizon compatible phone, same with AT&T, Sprint, or whatever the case may be. The same goes with the Sim card, make sure it is compatible with your carrier. I cannot emphasize this enough."
"Apple",5,"it works as a phone"
"Apple",5,"Thanks! Bought for a friend. She loves it."
"Apple",4,"The condition of the phone was good and had no problem with it but my husband lost it the day after he got the phone lmao 😩😩😩"
"Apple",4,"Like my new little iPhone. Apple said the program was bad why I cannot log into iTunes account an get apps."
"Apple",5,"Ordered this as a replacement for my son's phone that he broke. Had some issues getting it set up, but it wasn't the phone's fault, we just needed a new sim card. Once we went the store and got the card, it worked perfectly. We're both thrilled with it. Me, as I didn't have to spend full price on a replacement phone, and his cuz he can Face Time his friends again."
"Apple",5,"Super fast shipping. Seems to work great so far. Thank you."
"Apple",4,"came in on time seems to be working fine so far"
"Apple",1,"Wifi on device died within three months of purchase."
"Apple",1,"Bought this phone a couple of weeks ago and the phone will not hold a charge. Have to take it to an Apple store to have it repaired. Very unhappy about this."
"Apple",5,"Received a great looking and working used phone. No scratches. Check the specific sellers reviews first."
"Apple",5,"5 plums out of 5"
"Apple",2,"worked a whole 3 days. Power button was faulty."
"Apple",5,"I absolutely LOVE the phone, however, it was advertised as a VERIZON phone but when I received it and tried using it through my Verizon account, I was told by the customer rep that the phone I bought was for AT&T - not Verizon!!! I was so bummed... Even though I am a long-time Verizon customer (10 years now), I decided to keep the phone and just try AT&Ts service for a little while - oh my, what a BIG MISTAKE. To make a long, very negative story short and sweet, I ended up buying a VERIZON iPhone just like this one (blue, too) and IMMEDIATELY took my service back to Verizon; they only charge me $45 a month without a contract anyway. BUT... when my bill came from AT&T (only 3 weeks into my new service), they wanted almost $67 from me after telling me it would only be $45 from the beginning!!!! - HA - I'm not stupid and I refuse to be lied to, so that's why I changed back to Verizon with the same type of phone - because both Verizon and the PHONE rock!"
"Apple",5,"I already had an Iphone 5C but it only had 8GB of storage. I needed much more. I ordered this phone, it came earlier than expected. It was fully functional and had no problems. It also looks brand new. I've owned this now for a few months and everything is working fine. It offers plenty of storage. It was a good deal for the price."
"Apple",5,"I am extremely impressed, the phone was what I needed and is what I expected."
"Apple",5,"very nice iphone"
"Apple",5,"Works well Verizon network. Happy I got it!"
"Apple",1,"After one month, a chip on the logic board failed which controlled recharging the battery. Not Repairable. Had to purchase a new phone. I could have exchanged the phone with Apple for Ver5, but chose to upgrade to 6S and get a new phone."
"Apple",5,"Works as promised Condition better than listed."
"Apple",2,"The standing joke about the Apple iPhone 5c is that the ""c"" stands for ""cheap,"" not ""color."" The phone came with a sim card that you'll have to take to the Verizon store to activate. It also comes with a SIM port key, earbuds, a charger and the fun standard Apple icon stickers. I chose to purchase the green one, which was a fun spring green! It took two weeks to arrive at my doorstep, but the product booted just fine and worked for about a month. The processing is much faster than the iPhone 4, but in comparison to my mom's iPhone 6, it might just be worth waiting for the next iPhone to come out in the next couple of months. The ear piece stopped working after 32 days. I returned to the seller for a refund, but they charged me a 50% restocking fee. When it worked, the phone was nice and fun because of the color, but working with this vendor isn't worth it."
"Apple",5,"Great price, extremely fast shipping works as advertized!"
"Apple",4,"Moving from Android to Apple...my kids have this phone too and keep me straight on using it. Phone is superb and, while Apple has its moments, it is intuitive to use. Seller was VERY responsive...only reason not a 5 star is ""new"" phone had been opened for imei verification. Not sure that's industry standard. If it is, seller is 5 star."
"Apple",4,"It is compatible with Verizon. Not pink but PEACH, pretty beaten up...but not bad enough to return. A descent value for anyone who doesn't want to spend a fortune on a phone!"
"Apple",5,"I love this phone! Thank you so much."
"Apple",5,"norm!"
"Apple",5,"I got this for my husband and he absolutely loves it."
"Apple",1,"The discription reads that it is a Verizon Wireless phone. However, I did not receive a Verizon phone like promised and was unable to use it. It is also a phone of much lesser value if you try to sell it."
"Apple",4,"Basically in the condition described. However, with no SIM card it could not be used out of the box."
"Apple",5,"This phone is GREAT! While I didn't hear back from the seller - the service was QUICK! Thanks!"
"Apple",5,"Shipping took a bit, but the phone is in excellent condition and has made my life extremely easier. Bbrewer2 was very polite and got back to me quickly."
"Apple",5,"Love it. Excellent condition and beautifully packaged."
"Apple",5,"Excellent purchasing experience. Item just as described, new and in original packaging. Speedy shipping too!"
"Apple",1,"this cellphone scren is locked ,needed to enter pin , I don‘t know why ,anyonecan gime a advice?"
"Apple",5,"Awesome phone, mine came and there were no scratches on it and it was 100% fully functional."
"Apple",5,"excellent"
"Apple",5,"It's going great"
"Apple",5,"Just the right phone"
"Apple",4,"Very few scratches and works great. Wonderfully fast shipping and nice service."
"Apple",3,"The phone showed up a day early which i was excited about! It was unlocked and easy to set up! It actually didn't have any scratches or noticeable damage or scratches anywhere! I knew the charger wouldn't be the orginal but the charger i got didn't last long. the charger started to mess up and i have to play with it to get it to charge until i can get a new charger :( the charger is the only reason i don't give 5 stars."
"Apple",1,"Don't waste your time .buy from the Apple Store.When I got mine the battery life was very poor 2 hours usage 6 hours standby with no added apps and all the standard settings for battery life. After researching the problem and tryin everything it was clearly a bad battery.I paid to return it and the seller emailed me to say a replacement was sent. When I received the replacement clearly it was the same phone as I had forgotten to remove the screen protector. What's worse. The battery life now was less than 1hoir usage straight out of the box after full 7hr recharge from the wall adapter and no added apps.So I decided rather than waste any more money shipping back to this incompetent repair center I'd just buy the battery replace kit and do it myself!wish I'd spent the little extra to get at the Apple Store now."
"Apple",3,"The screen was scratched quite a bit. I expected that of the casing but not of the screen since, it seems that everybody uses a screen protector now a days. The rest was fine."
"Apple",4,"It was very good."
"Apple",5,"Worked good. Although with heavy scratch :(. Just glad it works well. Thanks"
"Apple",5,"Great experience. As expected."
"Apple",4,"I like my new phone I can text now."
"Apple",5,"Love it"
"Apple",5,"Yes it's LIKE NEW"
"Apple",5,"Bought for my niece . For the price couldn't as for a better deal."
"Apple",1,"dont buy this product ... its a fake one.. its not an apple product"
"Apple",5,"good"
"Apple",5,"As expected, arived one day earlyer than expected time, I will order again, the phone is brand new and in original package"
"Apple",5,"This phone is in like new condition as far as I can tell, works great and holds a good charge. No issues with its unlocked status. (I'm using it on TMobile.) Delivery was prompt to Amazon Locker."
"Apple",5,"It great"
"Apple",5,"Excellent condition"
"Apple",5,"I really like this iPhone 5s it was factory unlocked I got it currently with net10 right now I upgraded from a iPhone 4. For 195 what I paid I got a hell of a deal no scrapes no major scratches only con was the charger didn't work however I went to the dollar store and purchased a new one. Very good deal for the price don't pass if your looking to buy."
"Apple",1,"AT&T not covered in my area"
"Apple",5,"Great service and product from World Sellers, brand new, sealed iphone 5s , came with ios 8.1.1 instead of 7, made end of 2014, what's not to like!"
"Apple",5,"perfect conditions. Unlocked for Argentina."
"Apple",1,"cable wasnt original like description said the camera isnt 100% fuctional. really bad"
"Apple",4,"The phone was delivered on time. It was as advertised and works perfectly with the the telephone company I selected."
"Apple",5,"Works and looks as expected."
"Apple",1,"I had to take this phone in after owning it for 3 months (kept in a life-proof case). I was told by Apple that it was a refurbished phone, the screen is loose, and I am having software problems. This was not a new phone as advertised."
"Apple",5,"Came earlier than I expected a few dents in corners but all good"
"Apple",5,"Awesome thanks"
"Apple",5,"These guys are awesome! The phone was just as described: brand new factory GSM unlocked iPhone 5s 16gb! They even included a screen protector! I would definitely purchase something again from them!"
"Apple",1,"Extremely dissatisfied, we received the phone and have had constant issues, we received the blue screen of death multiple times, the phone refuses to charge, randomly shuts off, the screen will become unresponsive. DO NOT BUY YOUR PHONE FROM THESE PEOPLE!"
"Apple",5,"Thanks my daughter love it."
"Apple",5,"Didn't work out, but got a quick refund upon return."
"Apple",2,"Would not hold a charge. Would get hot when in use. Phone fell short of my expectations"
"Apple",5,"great"
"Apple",1,"I bought this phone ""new"" only to find out it is not. The battery percentage was going crazy so I took it into the apple store, only to find that it had been used for the last year and a half and the battery was failing because of it. Also, the software did not pass the apple test when I took it in. So if you want a failing phone with bad software this is the right place for you!"
"Apple",3,"the iphone is good! but i have an issue the headphones are ""fake"" plastic not rubbery like the original I expected better but its ok!"
"Apple",5,"I got item in very good condition"
"Apple",5,"Good"
"Apple",1,"Worst mobile its not working properly. Just for outside it is good but inside totally damage. Don't trust this seller and don't waste your money."
"Apple",1,"Ordered a brand new apple iphone 5s factory unlocked ., item came in an OPENED box without charger and the item doesn't look like brand new having lots of dust on it."
"Apple",1,"Do NOT buy This phone it was not unlocked as it said. It would NOT work with Verizon yet seller stated it would. I spent 1 hour 38 minutes with Verizon trying to figure it out. They called apple and Apple would not unlock it. The phone will NOT work with Verizon."
"Apple",5,"I am very satisfied with this product. I received it a day early and it was in perfect condition! I'm loving my new phone!"
"Apple",5,"the phone is just what i needed. its a lot faster than my last phone.i have most freinds with iphones. fast delivery.thank you"
"Apple",3,"It has been about a month of having my iPhone turned on and I'm starting to think that everything was made somewhat cheap. Yes, I dropped my phone, but it was on carpet from about 2 feat or less and had a very protective case on and for some reason the earphones are starting to stretch showing the wires. Now I have to pay $120 to get my screen fixed and buy more earphone."
"Apple",5,"Gift. I think it is very nice."
"Apple",5,"Very good value for money. It was a gift."
"Apple",4,"Very happy with product. Not happy at all with seller!"

I WOULD NEVER BUY FROM THIS SELLER..I HAVE CHECKEDNIN ANOTHER APPLE MOBILE REPAIR STORE AND IT IA CONFIRMED: MOBILE DOES NOT HAVE FIX. Even if we pay usd99 to change the screen, it Will solve.

"Apple",5,"great phone .works very good for me. No problem at T-Mobile or AT&T. It takes beautiful pictures and I am finding it very user friendly."
"Apple",1,"the phone I was shipped was not in a sealed box and after a while started having some troubles took the phone to a apple service center found out the phone had been activated in 2014 . I bought the phone in 2016 as a new phone . I contacted the seller and was told it was a closeout and they was no apple warranty and that he would do the warranty repairs. If this had been stated in the listing I would not have bought it ..A phone that had been activated in 2014 is not new."
"Apple",5,"good"
"Apple",5,"All perfect"
"Apple",1,"This phone was sold as new but after three months of use I got blue screen, was told by apple that the phone is refurbished and had the same problem, not honest, false advertisement."
"Apple",5,"Love it!"
"Apple",5,"Working perfect :D"
"Apple",5,"love it"
"Apple",4,"Quite a very good"
"Apple",5,"Cell phone works great!"
"Apple",1,"Ordered 2. Excellent phone but needed to return one because grandaughter decided to keep old phone and they would not let me return because past return date. Will never order from these people again!"
"Apple",4,"Thanks. Everything fine"
"Apple",5,"Alls good! The phone is in excellent condition..."
"Apple",5,"high quality, prompt services, happy with this purchase"
"Apple",5,"Ok"
"Apple",1,"awful"
"Apple",5,"Excellent"
"Apple",5,"Great phone, works perfect."
"Apple",5,"Excellent"
"Apple",3,"Good condition"
"Apple",5,"GREAT PHONE"
"Apple",5,"I used to have a Samsung, but after a couple years it started slowing down. Everyone in my family had switched to iPhone, and had nothing but great things to say. After buying this phone, I am not disappointed. It is by far the fastest phone I have ever used. Even when I have several apps open everything works flawlessly. The user interface is so intuitive, and it feels pretty cool to have a thumbprint as your password. The only feature I miss is swipe typing, but I cannot take off a star, because in every other way this phone is perfect."
"Apple",5,"I helped buy this phone for my boyfriend and he has no complaints about it even though it was previously owned. It is in excellent condition and honestly i wouldnt have been able to tell it was used if it didnt say so."
"Apple",4,"Much smaller than I expected, but still the product is high-end, you can tell it is well-made, with good materials.The seller was top-notch, and the product is being used in Argentina, so it is genuinely unlocked to use internationally with any GSM company."
"Apple",4,"I love it very good it's has a few marks but other wise the phone works"
"Apple",5,"Good product, fast shipping. Thank you very much."
"Apple",5,"The phone works perfectly, it is exactly i spected, i love it"
"Apple",4,"as expected"
"Apple",4,"Phone was nice in terms of look but didn't worked with my mobile network. Returned it."
"Apple",5,"brand new, works great. No complaints after arrival."
"Apple",3,"The screen was scratched quite a bit. I expected that of the casing but not of the screen since, it seems that everybody uses a screen protector now a days. The rest was fine."
"Apple",1,"I bought the phone in July and it was dead by November. Just stopped charging."
"Apple",1,"Died in just after 6 months - just when the return policy had expired."
"Apple",1,"Please Don't Buy it. I bought it and gifted it to my father. He could not use it for 3 months. Local i center told the phone was repaired three times before sold. Total treachery. So please, please dont buy it."
"Apple",1,"It didn't work it turns on fully charge then it turns back off very upset"
"Apple",4,"Great!"
"Apple",5,"Excellent. Thank you!"
"Apple",5,"I F'n hate this thing. My wife wanted an Iphone for her birthday so I got one for her and I can't stand having to use it when I forget mine at home. The apple IOS is so intuitive that I want to throw the thing at the wall every time I want to go back from a screen or do just about anything else. It's at least reliable atm though so there's that. It gets 5 stars for the fact that its exactly as advertised works for T-mobile and my wife tolerates it. I'm telling her to F off next time she wants another Iphone though."
"Apple",5,"En tiempo y forma"
"Apple",5,"Excellent"
"Apple",5,"Perfect!!!"
"Apple",5,"Perfect."
"Apple",3,"It does not connect to network and internet well..shows no service when kept idle..."
"Apple",5,"Good"
"Apple",4,"Phone is in good working condition"
"Apple",5,"Item as described, was easy to transfer data from iPhone 4s to it. Did have to get a new SIM card for this phone, the 4s would not fit in the 5s."
"Apple",1,"I returned this item because it kept shutting off. It was refunded, no problem"
"Apple",5,"As described ,works well"
"Apple",5,"Yes it was perfect thanks"
"Apple",5,"Work perfectly"
"Apple",5,"Works Very Well Thanks"

"Apple",5,"Phone looked new. All functions work perfectly, very satisfied!"
"Apple",5,"Excellent item. Completely new. It works perfectly with digitel in Venezuela. 100% recommended"
"Apple",5,"Everything was perfect"

"Apple",5,"The best there is,thank you....."

"Apple",5,"This phone works great! Fast shipping was unlocked and just popped my SIM card right in. Definently recommend for anyone in a hurry for a new phone. Much easier than trying to find one in Craigslist or Letgo."
"Apple",1,"The best i phone i by it thanx man ♡♡"
"Apple",5,"On time. The phone is Perfect"
"Apple",5,"Brand new, in sealed factory box. Unlocked and works great."
"Apple",1,"It's not very good"
"Apple",4,"Good phone"
"Apple",5,"Just what I wanted."
"Apple",5,"Okay so first of all, I emailed the seller and asked if there was any way he'd be able to get my order to me quicker, and he did just that. Secondly, the phone came ready to use. It came about half way charged all I needed to do was turn it on. Also the phone came as described, used but like new. There were a few scuffs on the top but no scratches or cracks that weren't previously mentioned from the seller. Finally, all I did was put my sim card in (T-Mobile​) and the phone was working right away. I didn't have to call my phone company and this phone set up in any way. Great seller and great product."
"Apple",5,"Excellent"
"Apple",1,"The Seller didn't factory unlock this phone as stated... He kept saying that he unlocked it, and I checked with APPLE, ISP, and a couple of professionals and it was locked. I would never buy from this idiot again. He defies all logic and just keeps telling me that it's unlocked. He provided no answer other than it was unlocked, and the iphone didn't work. So I professionally unlocked the phone, and it works now.Beware of people that tell you that the iphone is factory unlocked."
"Apple",5,"Great condition. Works well. The cost was not bad at all based on all that."
"Apple",5,"Exactly As Promised!Perfect Condition,No Complaints Whatsoever"
"Apple",4,"I'm very happy with it . It was same as described ."
"Apple",5,"a great gift for someone who is hard to buy for"

"Apple",3,"Telephone has a lot of scratches on the screen and it was not mentioned in the description."
"Apple",5,"It works perfectly!"
"Apple",5,"Phone was in good condition as advertised. Works great!!! No scratches. Unlocked as advertised."
"Apple",5,"On time so far product is excellent"
"Apple",2,"this phone networking problem, all time network up-down. no right way receive & send call so i want to return it."
"Apple",4,"The phone came in a sealed apple box and really does look like new. The only thing which was odd, was that when I checked for Apple warranty online they told me that the warranty was expired and the phone was produced more than 2 years ago. Customer service guaranteed me that still the phone was new and not refurbished and I was sticking with that, as really everything else seemed like new.Another small thing which is odd: this phone has Chinese preinstalled as language in all apps and many sub menus. Although changing the primary language to English it was not possible to remove Chinese completely as a language. I tried to get around that by installing Spanish as a second language so Chinese is now only third. Nevertheless Chinese signs keep popping up from time to time on the phone."
"Apple",4,"I recommend excellent, super fast delivery, and excellent phone. Thanks"
"Apple",1,"the phone is missing screws and plate at the top of lcd connectors. the phone is in very bad condition."
"Apple",5,"Works and looks as expected."

"Apple",5,"It great"
"Apple",5,"Excellent condition"
"Apple",5,"I really like this iPhone 5s it was factory unlocked I got it currently with net10 right now I upgraded from a iPhone 4. For 195 what I paid I got a hell of a deal no scrapes no major scratches only con was the charger didn't work however I went to the dollar store and purchased a new one. Very good deal for the price don't pass if your looking to buy."
"Apple",1,"AT&T not covered in my area"
"Apple",5,"Great service and product from World Sellers, brand new, sealed iphone 5s , came with ios 8.1.1 instead of 7, made end of 2014, what's not to like!"
"Apple",5,"perfect conditions. Unlocked for Argentina."
"Apple",1,"cable wasnt original like description said the camera isnt 100% fuctional. really bad"
"Apple",4,"The phone was delivered on time. It was as advertised and works perfectly with the the telephone company I selected."
"Apple",2,"The product has been defective from the start.Waste of money"
"Apple",3,"the iphone is good! but i have an issue the headphones are ""fake"" plastic not rubbery like the original I expected better but its ok!"
"Apple",5,"I got item in very good condition"
"Apple",5,"Good"
"Apple",1,"Worst mobile its not working properly. Just for outside it is good but inside totally damage. Don't trust this seller and don't waste your money."
"Apple",1,"Ordered a brand new apple iphone 5s factory unlocked ., item came in an OPENED box without charger and the item doesn't look like brand new having lots of dust on it."
"Apple",1,"Do NOT buy This phone it was not unlocked as it said. It would NOT work with Verizon yet seller stated it would. I spent 1 hour 38 minutes with Verizon trying to figure it out. They called apple and Apple would not unlock it. The phone will NOT work with Verizon."
"Apple",5,"I am very satisfied with this product. I received it a day early and it was in perfect condition! I'm loving my new phone!"
"Apple",5,"the phone is just what i needed. its a lot faster than my last phone.i have most freinds with iphones. fast delivery.thank you"
"Apple",3,"It has been about a month of having my iPhone turned on and I'm starting to think that everything was made somewhat cheap. Yes, I dropped my phone, but it was on carpet from about 2 feat or less and had a very protective case on and for some reason the earphones are starting to stretch showing the wires. Now I have to pay $120 to get my screen fixed and buy more earphone."
"Apple",5,"It worked for me"
"Apple",5,"Excellent purchasing experience. Item just as described, new and in original packaging. Speedy shipping too!"
"Apple",1,"this cellphone scren is locked ,needed to enter pin , I don‘t know why ,anyonecan gime a advice?"
"Apple",5,"Awesome phone, mine came and there were no scratches on it and it was 100% fully functional."
"Apple",5,"excellent"
"Apple",5,"It's going great"
"Apple",5,"Just the right phone"
"Apple",4,"Very few scratches and works great. Wonderfully fast shipping and nice service."
"Apple",3,"The phone showed up a day early which i was excited about! It was unlocked and easy to set up! It actually didn't have any scratches or noticeable damage or scratches anywhere! I knew the charger wouldn't be the orginal but the charger i got didn't last long. the charger started to mess up and i have to play with it to get it to charge until i can get a new charger :( the charger is the only reason i don't give 5 stars."
"Apple",1,"Don't waste your time .buy from the Apple Store.When I got mine the battery life was very poor 2 hours usage 6 hours standby with no added apps and all the standard settings for battery life. After researching the problem and tryin everything it was clearly a bad battery.I paid to return it and the seller emailed me to say a replacement was sent. When I received the replacement clearly it was the same phone as I had forgotten to remove the screen protector. What's worse. The battery life now was less than 1hoir usage straight out of the box after full 7hr recharge from the wall adapter and no added apps.So I decided rather than waste any more money shipping back to this incompetent repair center I'd just buy the battery replace kit and do it myself!wish I'd spent the little extra to get at the Apple Store now."
"Apple",5,"As expected, arived one day earlyer than expected time, I will order again, the phone is brand new and in original package"
"Apple",5,"Very good value for money. It was a gift."
"Apple",4,"Very happy with product. Not happy at all with seller!"
"Apple",5,"Loved it!!!"
"Apple",5,"Great!"
"Apple",3,"The phones has lines goin threw it but works just fine"
"Apple",5,"Exactly as described. Knocked and arrived in excellent condition."
"Apple",5,"Great phone. Works well! Arrived safely and promptly."
"Apple",5,"Phone arrived on time and looks brand new 😈"
"Apple",1,"The iPhone is not factory unlocked as advertised"
"Apple",1,"I bought this phone ""new"" only to find out it is not. The battery percentage was going crazy so I took it into the apple store, only to find that it had been used for the last year and a half and the battery was failing because of it. Also, the software did not pass the apple test when I took it in. So if you want a failing phone with bad software this is the right place for you!"
"Apple",1,"I had to take this phone in after owning it for 3 months (kept in a life-proof case). I was told by Apple that it was a refurbished phone, the screen is loose, and I am having software problems. This was not a new phone as advertised."
"Apple",5,"Came earlier than I expected a few dents in corners but all good"
"Apple",5,"Awesome thanks"
"Apple",5,"These guys are awesome! The phone was just as described: brand new factory GSM unlocked iPhone 5s 16gb! They even included a screen protector! I would definitely purchase something again from them!"
"Apple",1,"Extremely dissatisfied, we received the phone and have had constant issues, we received the blue screen of death multiple times, the phone refuses to charge, randomly shuts off, the screen will become unresponsive. DO NOT BUY YOUR PHONE FROM THESE PEOPLE!"
"Apple",5,"Thanks my daughter love it."
"Apple",5,"Didn't work out, but got a quick refund upon return."
"Apple",2,"Would not hold a charge. Would get hot when in use. Phone fell short of my expectations"
"Apple",5,"great"
"Apple",5,"Love it. Excellent condition and beautifully packaged."
"Apple",4,"It was very good."
"Apple",5,"Worked good. Although with heavy scratch :(. Just glad it works well. Thanks"
"Apple",5,"Great experience. As expected."
"Apple",4,"I like my new phone I can text now."
"Apple",5,"Love it"
"Apple",5,"Yes it's LIKE NEW"
"Apple",5,"Bought for my niece . For the price couldn't as for a better deal."
"Apple",1,"dont buy this product ... its a fake one.. its not an apple product"
"Apple",5,"good"
"Apple",4,"It works just like it's supposed to only problem is for payment it doesn't take my visa and the camera on the inside doesn't work so that's very upsetting."
"Apple",2,"It seems slow to me. I have had many IPADs, not a fan of this one."
"Apple",1,"Charger not work"
"Apple",4,"yes indeedit was in good shapthanks"
"Apple",5,"Totally awesome iPhone great condition works great, will buy from seller again he was very insightful"
"Apple",5,"Works as advertised"
"Apple",3,"Ok."
"Apple",5,"It came just as told and I loved it."
"Apple",1,"The phones was broken and couldnt is not able to take pictures"
"Apple",1,"the phone never turned on"
"Apple",5,"Great iPhone! Basic design and VERY well-made when compared to the newer models. The 2G not compatible with iCloud so you cannot back up your contacts to an iCloud account, but you can use iTunes. In fact, Apple recently changed their policy concerning apps so if you own any version of an app, that cannot be loaded on this 1st Generation iPhone, iTunes will ask if you want to download an older, compatible version if it is available. Also, iMessage works on this phone.Of course it still makes a great MP3 player, and you can surf the web with it."
"Apple",5,"Great buy. Great condition. Battery is brand new and holds for days. Classic phone. A true timeless piece. Everything done right."
"Apple",1,"Because it said slight damage from dayle wear and tear and the phone had a big chunk broke out of the whole bottom corner nothing that effected the screen and the charger that was set with the phone don't work says this device is not supported by this charger so not only does it have a chunk a little smaller than a dime broke completely out of the left corner it don't have no charger and even with a brand new charger it has trouble charging cause the charger port on the must be messed up it on charges when it wants"
"Apple",5,"All the other IPhones are overrated. The 2g works just as well. Basic. Sleek. Cool. Holds just the right amount of information that one needs."
"Apple",5,"I want to thank Amazon and the people that sells things on Amazon. when my co-worker told me I can find a lot of good stuff on amazon.com for cheap I was skeptical because I really don't like to shop on line and especially I don't like using my debit card online plus I thought I was going to be disappointed. so as soon as I got home I went on amazon.com and saw the iphone that my son wanted and I didn't have to spend that much for it. he needs it for school and his birthday is coming up so he's happy and i'm happy...thanks again Amazon!! Taliah."
"Apple",2,"this G2 iphone look good but did not work as well the ""ring volume is very low on high also did not have pin replace the SIM chip I would not recomend this this iphone in this condition if can't her the phone ring there need to be better quality control ..."
"Apple",5,"Well I'm not sure if this one said unlocked or not but it came to us locked. However by looking it up we were able to jailbreak and unlock it. I think this is a good phone for the price. I would most defense recommend people getting it if they aren't looking to keep up with the times. However every experience is different but I think it was worth it."
"Apple",1,"First of all, its no compatible with verizon (may affect you may not)... second, it doesn't fit anything on it, its old and its way overpriced for its quality..... this should be worth $2"
"Apple",1,"This item arrived on time, and looked great, it just didn't work. I couldn't even turn it on! Seriously I sat there for maybe 15 minutes looking at the frozen start-up screen hoping it would pass. Then, when I went to exchange it for a working one they tell me 'I see you placed this order with our subsidiary Warehouse Deals. With Warehouse Deals' inventory constantly changing, we're unable to replace your order.'So now, I have to find a printer to print out the return label, wait for it to get there, THEN wait 3-5 bussiness days for the money to get back. Don't even bother."
"Apple",4,"Amazon sent this phone in like new condition. The problem I have is that I didn't realize how outdated this iPhone is compared to the newest generations.... If you just want an iPhone then it is a good bargain."
"Apple",3,"Average quality"
"Apple",1,"I was looking for it to be bigger"
"Apple",5,"Excellent, fast, delivery."
"Apple",5,"Love it"
"Apple",4,"I just got my phone and plugged it in the charger sent and it wouldn't work. Plugged it in with my charger for my current iPhone 3GS. Still wouldn't charge then finally plugged it into my ihone and it started charging. The phone was completely dead when I got it and has finally come on so I know it at least works how well I'm not sure as I am waiting for it to charge completely. It did not come in a box like they said but that's ok I already have an iPhone box as I bought mine new for $1.06 when I signed on to my 3 year contract. At that time the phones had just come out. Ill update my listing once I mess with the phone. There were light scratches on the back but nothing gastly just normal wear."
"Apple",5,"I love this phone but, somebody stole it"
"Apple",1,"Disappointed in the phone"
"Apple",2,"Bought as a gift but didn't work and couldn't return because it was pasted the 14 day policy! Lesson learned! 😡"
"Apple",2,"Had water damage inside phone"
"Apple",5,"Awesome"
"Apple",5,"Hey for a cheap price it was good I bought it and thought it was going to be broken, but really good condition but don listen to anyone else the phone is amazing and I only spent around $45 for the phone, charger, and a SIM card but from different sellers too"
"Apple",1,"Slow or no internet, no apps to download. Barely usable"
"Apple",4,"This is my daughters phone and she used that phone until she couldn't use it anymore. It is a very durable phone because my grandson chucked it all the time and it didn't crack or anything. Worth the money."
"Apple",5,"good thanks!"
"Apple",1,"I had to have it unlocked which cost money! I had to have the speaker fixed bc I couldn't hear anyone on it! Over all I should have not bought this phone..."
"Apple",3,"I REALLY LIKED THE IPHONE IT WAS A PLACE WHERE I COULD LISTEN TO ALL MY MUSIC. BUT TO DOWNLOAD APPS WAS HARD BECAUSE OF THE IOS"
"Apple",5,"I'm really enjoying it. It functions as advertised. I would recommend it for anyone that needs a simple basic phone that can be used as a camera and to surf the web and get all their correspondence online."
"Apple",1,"Have not been able to have this phone unlocked. AT&T can't do it, verizon can't do it. Seems this was a complete waste of money."
"Apple",5,"i like this new phone i got it is so cool and i am on it all day and every day thank you"
"Apple",3,"Fasting Shipping but IPhone is not in great condition like it said( missing volume button and crack near SIM card)."
"Apple",2,"The cell phone was not chargeable. I returned it."
"Apple",5,"Goid"
"Apple",5,"POSITIVE product..."
"Apple",5,"I was nervous buying a phone on here. But its in perfect condition!!! I love it<3"
"Apple",1,"Very old didn't like it"
"Apple",4,"I chose this rating because I like itThe phone was cheap but useableI recommend this to people with cellphoneUnderstanding."
"Apple",1,"The worst thing I have ever bought it broke in a month and how it broke was it lit on fire when plugged in the charger"
"Apple",1,"Had to pay a shop to fix it before I could use it!The charger that came with the phone was bad,so the phone would not charge! Not knowing it was the charger I took it to a shop to see what the problem was and they found the phone was improperly assembled ( missing screws) and the mute button was broken!"
"Apple",5,"Phone works great & arrived really fast!"
"Apple",2,"This was ok"
"Apple",4,"Love the phone, still in good condition, screen is perfect. The only thing is I have to bring to have it unlock so I can use with my sim card. It would be an extra fee to have unlock. Still would buy it again."
"Apple",1,"The phone does not work and was a huge waste of money! Shame on you for selling a phone that unusable and for ripping me off."
"Apple",2,"You can't upgrade the operating system, so most of the apps I want to get like from Facebook, my local grocery store, or for weather channel, I can't get them. I also can't find any of the older apps for Facebook."
"Apple",5,"I chose this rate because item arrived as described, as said used Like new.I would like to recommend it to all my friends."
"Apple",5,"When I received a used iphone, it was defective and did not match the description. I contacted Monsterbuyback to let them know and they were supremely cooperative. They apologized and were very speedy with their return of my money. Great company! Reputable and trustworthy! Thanks Monsterbuyback!"
"Apple",5,"Phone in great shape, the packaging was great the devilery was very fast and I did not have any problems with the order."
"Apple",5,"good producto, buen buen excellente precio rapido envio, excellente servicio, empaque adecuado no muy grande y si pequeño,buena comunicacion e informacion del articulo"
"Apple",3,"It doesn't said that this phone is locked. It would be good if amazon described it to let the customer the understand the product well"
"Apple",5,"This phone shipped faster than I thought it would and I was very glad! (:It arrived in very good condition, just as it was described and I have had no problems with this product(:I would definitely buy from this seller again!GodBlessxoxo"
"Apple",1,"I got this phone for a friend and it was absolutely terrible. There were scratches all over it. Took it to many different companies and none of them knew how to fix it. Couldnt set up to call anyone or basically do anything with it. I am hoping that he will give me a refund for it. The seller had better."
"Apple",5,"Great for use as an iPod! Overall I am really satisfied with this product. These words are place holders because it's telling me to add more."
"Apple",3,"phone works for calling but other features such as camera and web doesnt work. so for emergency purposes it was ok.it was a I phone without any features.. but I will use when in car.."
"Apple",5,"I love this phone because is small and is not that heavy. I used it for prepaid with att service."
"Apple",1,"This is the second phone that I have ordered. The first one only said AT&T not unlocked, so I returned it at my expense and made sure to order an unlocked phone, well guess what this phone is locked and I am not happy. The box said unlocked, the slipping lable said unlocked, my order said unlocked, but it is still locked. I want an unlocked phone and I am tired of having to send this back at my expense to get what I paid for.Please help!"
"Apple",4,"I considered this phone because it had the features and price I was comfortable with. In fact I'm recommending this to friends at the moment. the only thing I don't like its locked I thought it was opened . Now I have to unlock it which I cant give a complete review until I do .It looks ok to me. Thanks!"
"Apple",2,"No sim card came with this cellphone. I can't take pics, make videos, store telephone numbers, etc. Haven't really used it yet."
"Apple",5,"This was bought for my son. He absolutely loves it. Says it is the best phone he ever had. That it was a very good value for the price paid."
"Apple",1,"""New"" cell was not. It had multiple registration numbers, broken and bent posts to charge. WE did get the money we spent refunded but the whole thing was a hassle. Too many problems!"
"Apple",1,"Unless you know how to jail break this phone... what's the point? Most apps don't support this old phone. <(it's not really old, they just want you to spend money on the newer version. wtf? but whatever)>"
"Apple",3,"Just okay! Should have done my research before buying! The IOS is upgradeable and my grandson couldn't day any of the things he was use to doing on his Android!"
"Apple",5,"Excellent"
"Apple",1,"Very bad condition I almost can't use it."
"Apple",1,"When I got the phone it was in decent shape. The owner even gave me an old otterbox to go with the phone, however the phone would die after being fully charged with 10-15 minutes of being unplugged from the charger. So basically this phone was unusable for school so I ended up buying a Net10 prepaid phone that actually held up throughout most of my Freshman year. I guess the lesson to be learned is that used Iphones are terrible and amazon doesn't actually check used products for defectiveness before shipment."
"Apple",5,"Works great!"
"Apple",1,"software was all messed up, cannot close open programs running in background. Definetly not worth the dollars."
"Apple",5,"Thanks for the great phone!It was in almost perfect condition, so happy with my puchase. Such a vintage, fun phone to have. Shipped quickly, Thanks again!"
"Apple",5,"Very nice items and shipped earlier than expected by the seller. Nice item as a gift."
"Apple",2,"lot of scratches"
"Apple",5,"Its an awesome buy. No one believes me when i tell them how much i paid for this phone.Its unbelievably new and in good condition. Great! Great! Great!"
"Apple",1,"Thanks but little did it say updated but I will be jail breaking it"
"Apple",5,"Good price, purchased it for music/ipod substitute. Delivered promptly as promised. Keep in mind that these are used phones. Mine arrived and was in very good condition with just some scratches on the back cover. Nothing more than normal wear. The phone did need a SD card so be prepared for that.

"Apple",5,"it was great.. love it.. very satisfied costumer definitely will by again form u.. it came on time and great condition"
"Apple",4,"This phone was in a great condition. I loved the phone, however I gave this a four star rating because you cannot use this phone for apps. Apple has disabled any upgrades for the IO's for the iPhone 1 through 3, therefore you cannot get applications. So the phone is only good for texting, calling and searching the web. If you do not use any apps, it's a great deal; but if you need your apps don't even bother."
"Apple",5,"Loved it in very good condition"
"Apple",1,"Worst iPhone ever. Do not buy this phone, it's more of a paperweight than a phone. There are so many problems with the 3g. The iOS is 4.2.1 which basically means that there are very few apps for this phone. Can't get any of the major apps like Facebook, Twitter, Google+, YouTube, Amazon, Pinterest, and so fourth. Most of the apps are for iOS 6.0 and above. It took me days to actually finds some apps by searching the internet. The phone has a static sound when making a phone call & it is hard to hear the person on the other end. Surfing on the internet is so slow and it takes pages too long to load, my cheap tablet is faster than this phone. Now on to the problems with my phone. It makes a weird clicking noise when I unlock the phone. My phone was attached to another account when I tried to download music, had to erase the phone and start over. I can't get apps in the app store on the phone because it has another email attached to the phone, so if I wanted to get apps, I have to go to iTunes and add the apps from there. Tried to contact the seller to return the phone and never received a reply. Going to reset the phone back to factory settings to turn it into an iPod or back up phone. My advice is to purchase an iPhone 4s or higher if you have the money, even a 3gs would be better or just get a Samsung phone. It would be a good backup phone to have, a good iPod player, a good digital picture frame,or to give to a child with some games to play. But as an actual phone, stay away."
"Apple",1,"Buttons did not work."
"Apple",3,"Bien"
"Apple",5,"Excellent item and fast shipping"
"Apple",5,"ok"
"Apple",5,"arrived in time before my trip, thanks a bunch! Apparently the phone was still locked! costed me an extra $40 to unlocked the unit so it could be used in Mexico. No big deal but thought I mention...Phone was in great condition as per description. Thank you"
"Apple",5,"As described perfect item used whited00r firmware works excellent now, thank you."
"Apple",3,"A nice inexpensive phone (in its day) bought used BUT it will not run any of the new apps as its OS cannot be upgraded. It works well as a basic backup phone and as a music player. that's about it."
"Apple",2,"Would have been fine if I could have up dated it."
"Apple",1,"phone wont stay lit.and ringer button moves on it's own.can't tell if someone is calling.can't see screen to turn on speaker or to know if your call has ended THE PHONE DOSE NOT WORK!!!!!!!!!!"
"Apple",2,"The phone was in good condition the only problem I had was that I could not open the slide were you put the sim card and it was very hard to open and closed, also the phone did not work with my AT & T sim card, however I did not had to much of a problem getting my money back, Amazon help me with my credit being put back to my account....thanks Amazon for your help."
"Apple",1,"Had to activate the phone but the SIM card tray is missing. This was not mention on the description. Brought it to the store to get another SIM tray and couldn't not insert the tray. Had to pay the store to fix it. Waste of money!! Scam!"
"Apple",5,"Though the touch pads are a bit too sensitive and the phone do sometimes 'misbehave' by self-dialing unintended contacts,phone is generally outstanding and meets my expectations.I can't ask for better!"
"Apple",3,"bigger then expected but dont expect it to do a lot then u expected and they may gliche up so be careful"
"Apple",4,"The product was in fantastic conditions, problem is that Iphone 3G is a lite bit ""old"" to support some Apps like Whatsapp. Not taking into account this, it is an excellent product, works perfectly.There was a miss delivery but was rapidly ammended and product was finally delivered to me."
"Apple",1,"I wish I had known that apple no longer supported this device. I can get no apps and the software is slow and antiquated. I feel like a fool for spending this money on this device which is basically useless."
"Apple",2,"I have had an iphone 3G previously and I loved it. This iphone was working fine for 2-3 weeks and now it won't turn on. I was told I need to replace the battery which is $80 . At this point I should have sprung for a new iphone!"
"Apple",2,"the phone was not unlocked and had said that if he was.!"
"Apple",3,"I didn't like the iphone at first because it arrived locked. After much investigating how to unlock the phone, I am relieved to say that everything worked out just fine. The iPhone is unlocked & my son is enjoying it."
"Apple",5,"It turned out to be a perfect gift for a loved one works well as expected but I had to unlock it."
"Apple",5,"this item came better than i thought it would the only scratches are at the back n its hardly visible the front is very clean, delivery came on time, n its just perfect and for a good price...btw had to unlock it at a dealer bt no big problem."
"Apple",1,"***UPDATE...I forgot to mention that the phone was listed here on Amazon, as a 16gb, and it turned out when the tech at Apple ran the test on the phone, it was determined that not only was the phone junk...it was an 8gb. phone, not a 16gb. as the Seller and Amazon had listed!!! again...Beware!!!*****BEWARE AND BE ADVISED THAT THIS SELLER IS VERY DISHONEST AND A CROOK!!!!*****I BOUGHT THE 3G PHONE FROM YOU BY YOUR AMAZON LISTING STATING THAT THE PHONE IS LIKE NEW CONDITION WITH NO SCRATCHES OR ANY ISSUES OR PROBLEMS WITH THE PHONE WHAT SO EVER! PROBLEMS::::THE CASE HAS MANY SCRATCHES ON THE BACK OF IT,BUT IF THAT WAS THE ONLY ISSUE I WOULD NOT BE CONTACTING YOU. ***THE PHONE IS JUNK!! THE PHONE HAS BEEN JAIL BROKE AND WAS USED WITH ANOTHER CARRIER,(SUCH AS TEAM MOBILE). I BOUGHT THIS PHONE FOR MY TEENAGE DAUGHTERS 15th BIRTHDAY. WE DID NOT TRY TO HAVE THE PHONE ACTIVATED AS SOON AS WE RECEIVED IT, BECAUSE HER BIRTHDAY WAS A WEEK LATER. AFTER SHE OPENED THE WRAPPED UP PHONE ON HER BIRTHDAY, WITH ALL HER FRIENDS (Her Gift from us-Mom and Dad),THE NEXT DAY WE TOOK HER AND HER PHONE TO OUR LOCAL CORPORATE AT&T STORE TO HAVE THE PHONE ACTIVATED, THEY ATTEMPTED (for over 2.5 long Hours!!) TO ACTIVATE THIS PHONE. IT WOULD NOT ACCEPT THE AT&T INFO AND PROGRAM TO ACTIVATE IT AND WORK. THEY THEN SENT ME TO THE APPLE STORE AT THE SHOPPING MALL (which was over an hour away!) I had to wait 2.5 hours while a technician looked at the phone and ran test to see whether or not the phone could be activated...***THE FINAL DECISION WAS THAT THE PHONE HAD BEEN TAMPERED WITH INTERNALLY AND HAD BEEN JAIL BROKEN TO ACCEPT ANOTHER CARRIER AND WOULD NEVER BE ABLE TO BE RESTORED OR REASSIGNED TO AT&T!!!! I FEEL THAT YOU KNEW THAT THERE WAS AN INTERNAL ISSUE AND YOU TOOK ADVANTAGE OF ME AND TOOK MY MONEY KNOWING GOOD AND WELL THAT THE PHONE COULD NEVER BE RESTORED ACTIVATED BY ANOTHER CARRIER!!!! *** ***UPDATE...I forgot to mention that the phone was listed here on Amazon, as a 16gb, and it turned out when the tech at Apple ran the test on the phone, it was determined that not only was the phone junk...it was an 8gb. phone, not a 16gb. as the Seller and Amazon had listed!!! again...Beware!!! I AM REALLY PISSED AND THE FACT THAT YOU MADE US LOOK LIKE AN ASS TO OUR DAUGHTER, AS SHE CRIED AND WAS VERY UPSET ABOUT THE PHONE NOT WORKING AND NOW SHE STILL DOES NOT HAVE A PHONE!!! AND TO TOP IT ALL OFF, WE BOUGHT A $60.00 DOLLAR OTTER BOX TO PUT THE PHONE IN TO PROTECT IT!! SO NOW I AM OUT $172.99 PLUS ALL MY WASTED TIME AND GAS!!! BECAUSE OF THIS EXPERIENCE....I WOULD ADVISE ANY AND ALL PROSPECTIVE BUYS TO STEER CLEAR FROM THIS SELLER AND ALL AMAZONS USED PHONES AS THEY ARE LIKE CROOKS,SCAM ARTIST AND A LAIRS!!!!!!!!!! YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED!!!"
"Apple",1,"The phone that Amazon sent me was all scratched up, and it honestly looked as if the dropped it a few time then rubbed steel wool on the back of it. Thumbs down. This is one customer that wont be buying from Amazon anymore."
"Apple",2,"I got iphone it was locked.So I have to unlock it & I have to pay another $40.00.Still phone is in good condition."
"Apple",3,"The phone works regularly but are of poor quality headphones and the charger does not work any accessory works even if phone is so cute"
"Apple",5,"MEET MY EXPECTATIONS IN 100%. ARRIVE ON TIME. PERFECT CONDITIONS TOTALLY RECOMMENDED. iPhone 3G, USB Wall Adapter Charger with USB to Dock Connector cable"
"Apple",1,"got i 3g i phone from you ..was told by amazon it was unlocked ..contacted amazon and told me to contact apple so i did and was told not there problem ...contacted amazon again ...told its the sellers fault .and was send this.... I looked into your order and see that it was placed with ""Warehouse Deals"", a seller on our website. Because Warehouse Deals's inventory is constantly changing, we can't replace or send items sold by them that are Fulfilled by Amazon. I understand this is disappointing and we are really sorry about it. DISGUSTED as it is a present for Christmas ...and now paying out of my pocket 67 euros....and no offer of paying for the unlock of the i phone ..."
"Apple",5,"My package arrived earlier than indicated. I was able to activate the phone w/o any problems. I am very pleased."
"Apple",5,"Very pleased. The used iphone came in great condition, and actually better than I expected it would be! Great phone for the value."
"Apple",5,"The phone features were excellent. Minor cosmetic damages. Nice color. The seller provided instant feedback and answered all my questions. I would buy again based on quality and customer service."
"Apple",1,"Sent it back was out dated junk"
"Apple",5,"Exactly as advertised"
"Apple",4,"Good unlocked"
"Apple",3,"wouldnt hold a charge. had to return."
"Apple",1,"Total waste of money unless all you want is phone/text everything is outdated and you can't get newer apps"
"Apple",3,"Ok"
"Apple",4,"quality good for price"
"Apple",5,"Very good"
"Apple",4,"IPhone 4 are now 4 models old but if you are looking for a phone to ply games on itunes or just make basis call, or access facebook this is a great phone. I bought it just to access games on itunes. Apple makes a great product but this is not the latest and greatest phone out there."
"Apple",1,"biggest mistake still havent gotteb it it sucks"
"Apple",5,"I love it and I thank you so much for this phone, it came jus in time"
"Apple",5,"very good"
"Apple",5,"Better than I expected. The price is right. Totally a great phone."
"Apple",2,"My first apple product honestly. To little to late really. Slow and basically useless at this point in history. I jailbroke it and messed around with all the options that infers. Slow mostly unusable like I said. A fun toy for the tech savy customer. Junk to everyone else."
"Apple",5,"great"
"Apple",5,"very nice now use only caharger bad"
"Apple",5,"I love bat inhops its com unlocked beacouse the ather i received its verizon"

"Apple",4,"good"
"Apple",5,"item as describe"
"Apple",5,"I talked about when it would come and he is right. The phone in great condition."
"Apple",5,"I love it"
"Apple",1,"Everything is outdated! You literally can't download any apps. Kik, sc, etc. The safari breaks down all the time too. Waste of money. Only thing that works is the camera with bad quality."
"Apple",1,"Cant get in"
"Apple",5,"It did not came with the box it came with the phone phew thanks its perfect for my collection"
"Apple",5,"It was everything I expected it to be and arrived before the date amazon had set."
"Apple",5,"Works good"
"Apple",4,"Love the phone, still in good condition, screen is perfect. The only thing is I have to bring to have it unlock so I can use with my sim card. It would be an extra fee to have unlock. Still would buy it again."
"Apple",1,"The phone does not work and was a huge waste of money! Shame on you for selling a phone that unusable and for ripping me off."
"Apple",2,"You can't upgrade the operating system, so most of the apps I want to get like from Facebook, my local grocery store, or for weather channel, I can't get them. I also can't find any of the older apps for Facebook."
"Apple",5,"I chose this rate because item arrived as described, as said used Like new.I would like to recommend it to all my friends."
"Apple",5,"When I received a used iphone, it was defective and did not match the description. I contacted Monsterbuyback to let them know and they were supremely cooperative. They apologized and were very speedy with their return of my money. Great company! Reputable and trustworthy! Thanks Monsterbuyback!"
"Apple",5,"Phone in great shape, the packaging was great the devilery was very fast and I did not have any problems with the order."
"Apple",5,"good producto, buen buen excellente precio rapido envio, excellente servicio, empaque adecuado no muy grande y si pequeño,buena comunicacion e informacion del articulo"
"Apple",3,"It doesn't said that this phone is locked. It would be good if amazon described it to let the customer the understand the product well"
"Apple",5,"This phone shipped faster than I thought it would and I was very glad! (:It arrived in very good condition, just as it was described and I have had no problems with this product(:I would definitely buy from this seller again!GodBlessxoxo"
"Apple",1,"I got this phone for a friend and it was absolutely terrible. There were scratches all over it. Took it to many different companies and none of them knew how to fix it. Couldnt set up to call anyone or basically do anything with it. I am hoping that he will give me a refund for it. The seller had better."
"Apple",1,"The phone does not hold a charge at all.I cant take it off the charger or it will die even when it says 100%"
"Apple",5,"So it's not the newest phone out there, so what. This phone was cheaper than getting an iPod of same GB size. It's an apple product so good support, good apps."
"Apple",5,"This classic iPhone has the old school shape and weight, with plenty of performance. I'm one for simplicity and the classic 3GS is a solid buy."
"Apple",5,"It performs great. I would recommend it to anyone that wants an iphone, but can't afford the latest one out there."
"Apple",1,"Product in good condition but incomplete, because i miss miss accessories had the doubt if so go on and buy it had bought a better one because i had to make additional spending"
"Apple",4,"got just like they said and im happy with it however it was missing the on/off switch cover and I had to have that repaired but my otter box cover is the only thing that keeps it in place- phone looks and works fine but I was a tad disappointed with the missing part"
"Apple",5,"I bought this phone for my son & he loves it especially it's being his first iPhone. Great product at a great price. Item arrived at the time it said it would"
"Apple",1,"On the description for the iphone It said it didnt work but could be fixed but it wasnt coming on and you didnt drop it or do anything to it! but i took it to the shop to be fixed and they said that it had water damage to it and could not be fixed! :-("
"Apple",4,"Both the phones where in nearly new condition. However few days latter battery of one of the phone become like balloon and braking most of the internal parts. the front glass came out etc.."
"Apple",1,"I was fooled by the item description. It was totally below expectations. I could not even use the phone. Seems that they were just trying to place a broken phone to innocent buyers..."
"Apple",5,"Love it"
"Apple",5,"Was the best"
"Apple",1,"when i recieved the phone the sim card reader was not working and phone would not get passed activation setup screen"
"Apple",1,"The particular phone I got, Well it exploded after it's first Charge! I'm glad it wasn't on my son at the time. I believe he may have gotten hurt!"
"Apple",5,"good"
"Apple",1,"I don't like it because I need ios 7 upgrade and it wont let me upgrade to it so now I need to buy another new phone that will take the ios 7 upgrade"
"Apple",2,"I paid over $200 for a 16 gb phone and ended up getting an 8 gb."
"Apple",5,"It's beautiful,no real scratches,no cracks.But I may be sending it back,can't access Amazon account on it,or Facebook😱"
"Apple",5,"runs soooooooo smoth"
"Apple",1,"False advertising . It was stating the phone was factory unlocked and I called in to make sure I was getting the product as advertise the customer service rep assured me I would received factory unlocked phones and it doesn't seems like no 3rd party people wanted to touch the phones to try and unlocked them."
"Apple",1,"Phone came with screen popped out, but still working, and a scratch on the back. A day later, the phone screen was completely popped out. Sending it back as soon as possible."
"Apple",1,"Everything about the purchase was good except the battery. The item was delievred quickly, it came with all the accesories and in good condition. However, there were big issues with the batter. The battery life of the phone was terrible, if I listened to music for a hour or so right after charging the phone I would have to recharge it immediatly....same with intensive texting....and somehimes battery said 50% and it would just shut off receiving a phone call....the cell phone shut off on me so many times that I had to keep it plugged in....which entirely defeats the purpose of having a phone! I would strongly suggest that before you buy a used cell phone you ask the seller about the battery. In the end I returned the phone and they were quick with the refund. I give them one star because everything was good, except the phone!!"
"Apple",3,"I guess for the price the condition wasnt THAT bad, but i was really hoping for better, few visible scratches on the screen and back, but other than cosmetics the phone works pretty well, bought it for my mom. if you just need a phone like this and could careless about the cosmetics then id recomend it (bought it from amazon warehouse or something) otherwise i'd invest in a better looking phone youd probably get a little more for your money. i paid 120 to 130 or something. Good over all, but wished for better."
"Apple",5,"This product is very good, and it is what I like to buy it, and it is a very good deal!"
"Apple",5,"aside from the usual wear and tear scratches, all works just fine, its awesome!! and it got here on time soooo goooddd!!!! thanks for being trustworthy...definitely buying with you in future"
"Apple",5,"The phone works great and arrived quickly. This is a used product and I'm very happy with it. No problems."
"Apple",2,"Though the phone came packaged in a box and bubble wrapping, the upkeep of the phone was worn and scratched up.All of the open sockets had dirt in them.I was disappointed with the purchase."
"Apple",5,"We got this for our 15 year old for Christmas--his first phone. He's as happy as a clam and so are we. My only complaint against the iPhone is that the battery can't be replaced by ordinary humans. But it does good stuff and it always works."
"Apple",4,"my iphone is working good but the power button is acting up but everything else is working right thank you for the iphone"
"Apple",5,"the iphone was as described it was excellent i`m trying to unlock it`s off contract AT&T , really good iphonethis seller is really good and fast service"
"Apple",5,"Yes, the used iPhone 3GS works the way it should. I actually received two for the price of one. Also, both iPhones works with any SIM card that I putted."
"Apple",1,"bid for the purchase of an iphone 3gs 16gb, and they sent me was a iphone 3g 16gb with case broken in one corner and locked when the advert says this factory unlocked and it is a 3gs"
"Apple",5,"I'm a senior citizen and have been puzzled by many of the newer phones so I started out slow with the I-phone 3G. I knew right away I should have gone all the way and purchased the newest one. It has been so easy to learn. I recommend it to anyone"
"Apple",4,"works amazing, sooo fast and love IOS7 , its super fast and i love SIRI being on it with the new update."
"Apple",1,"I wouldn't even give it one star. I got this phone for my mother. She loved it but it wouldn't charge so had to send it back!"
"Apple",5,"Item was as described. Like new in the original box and packaging, with plastic protective sheet across screen, immaculate, with headphones and all papers and manual. It works just like my original 3GS (which served me for 5 years). Fantastic!"
"Apple",5,"Pros and consI will start with the cons: I forgot that the 3GS did not have siri. That was my fault, and because its an older model. and is on the newest firmware; the battery life is not all that great. 7 hours of use before it dies.Other reviews state that this company is shipping 3G phones instead of 3Gs.At first i thought the same thing until I called my carrear, and gave them the model number. They confirmed it was 3GS.Pros.Item arrived extremly quickly :-)As advertised it was brand new in box un-opened. :-)With moderate use, without the use of GPS, or downloading apps. Canging settings from 3G to 2G noticably increases the battery life.Over all i am extremly happy with my purchase."
"Apple",3,"Currently it is 2014, the 3gs is discontinued. However most of the apps I want are still working for it. Other reviews were full of lists that didnt work, but I tried them on the 3gs I got recently and the ones that didnt work were usually ones I didnt expect to work. Youtube,bbc News, Google Maps, GPS apps, Amazon Prime video, kindle books. All of these apps worked fine with no errors. As well as Final Fantasy Dimensions. I would expect most games not to work in this, but the only ones I've tried are FFD and Bejeweled which work fine. As for the phone itself, the screen is small and its sometimes not very reactive."
"Apple",2,"This phone was a replacement used by my daughter.When received she told me the phone wouldn't take andkeep a charge. I was told to put the phone on Airplane modeto charge. It never made a difference."
"Apple",1,"I ordered the 16GB model, but was sent the 8GB model instead. I contacted them via amazon, but haven't heard back from them since.If I wanted the 8GB model, I would have saved a lot of money and ordered it originally."
"Apple",1,"My phone worked when I first got it after trying to update phone went dead now won't turn back on"
"Apple",5,"I could not tell this phone had ever been used before I got it - it is in perfect shape and it works very well. It is much faster than the 3G, and I also like the white color of the phone.I recommend this for anyone who wants an iPhone but doesn't want to shell out the big bucks for the latest model. Great phone, good deal."
"Apple",5,"I got the phone in record time! When I first got the phone everything was as described, now when I got the phone and set it up it worked great, then it started shutting down by it self and wouldn't turn back on unless I plugged it in, now as a technitian myself I new the battery was bad so I contacted the seller and he was very assertive and quick to fix issue, he offered to send me another phone but I couldn't be without my phone so, I told him I bought a new battery to put in it, so then he offered to refund the amount of the battery and shipping cost! He was very quick and responsive to my needs and I am very pleased. I also put new battery in phone works great! I am thinking of buying another iPhone 3GS for my mother and this company will be the one I most definitely will be going through hands down! Also the iPhone was packaged in original box with factory paperwork and the charge cable, and came with a otter box defender case and earphones! Very satisfied!"
"Apple",4,"I needed to replace an old 3G iPhone that was having too many problems to keep fixing. The 3GS added 8GB of memory, a better camera, runs on the current operating system and still fits the old case that I didn't want to replace. If the battery life was a little better this would have had 5 stars, but the battery is a bit weak. (Not surprising for a used iPhone, however.)"
"Apple",5,"excellent everything arrived on time without inconvenienceI recommend it. thanks for product safety . from venezuela thanksbye bye"
"Apple",1,"hello.I made ​​the purchase of wireless equipment iphone 3gs, it is locked by AT & T, also just told me via phone that it can not be unlocked by having no bill authorized agent at & t and additionally it is reported as being stolen .I request that you are sending to another device (unlocked, and legal bill at & t) or my money back via giftcard or similar.I'm from Venezuela, so the shipment and return the equipment I find difficult, but not impossible, so I requested to indicate which way to send your unit and I point out when I sent mine."
"Apple",5,"Havent had a chance to activate for use yet but i was happy with how it was packaged nicely to prevent any crcks or damages.so this review is mostly for how nicley packaged it was..Thanks!"
"Apple",1,"I bought it a week ago and was dissatisfied, when I brought It to apple store, they said, this is not original phone!"
"Apple",5,"excelentes 100% recomendados el paqueyte llego en el tiempo establecido y en perfecto estado.el cell trabaja perfecta mente y muy contento por la compra"
"Apple",5,"I love this nifty phone because i can unlock it and then use another carrier of GSM like T-mobile. This is something i will have until ios 7 comes out since iphone 3gs wont support it. To make this even more special amazon sells these phones and apple doesnt or other companies since semtember 2012 these iphones are for sale in store. In the package came the Iphone itself, a sim card removal tool, New Earphones, and a New USB connector. Overall I am happy with this iphone until IOS 7 comes out then i will upgrade."
"Apple",5,"Good"
"Apple",5,"This iPhone is for my colection of iPhones I started and I could not be more pleased. The Iphone3GS was refurbushed, had no problem getting it unlocked by AT&T. The phone does not have a single scratch on it, it looks brand new. Very pleased."
"Apple",5,"Niceee"
"Apple",1,"the description was NEW but when we got it, it didn't hold service so I took it to AT&T and the APPLE store and the pulled the serial # and saw the phone was purchased 5 years ago."
"Apple",5,"Great"
"Apple",1,"The phone would not get service. I purchased 3 phone s on amazon. Only one was not hacked. I will not buy another phone on amazon."
"Apple",1,"Very bad"
"Apple",1,"This phone is a real disappointment. I can not get onto the internet unless I am at an establishment that has WIFI. So this phone is useless to me. Now I have to buy another phone that is in working condition this is the first time I have ever had a problem buying a phone on Amazon."
"Apple",5,"very good"
"Apple",3,"I am having problems with the charger hookup. Is difficult to hook the charger"
"Apple",5,"iphone was in a vary good condition. there vere no scratches. everything was included as it was discribed. i'm very setisfied with my purchase."
"Apple",1,"Phone did not work it was junk could not get money back called and complained they would not do anything about it"
"Apple",3,"good service, fast delivery. I didn't arrange appearance of iphone 3gs received by me, namely attritions, scratches, chips and cracks. In the description them it wasn't mentioned"
"Apple",2,"In short I end up spending $92.00 in fixing this specious deal, i will never make such a mistake of buying USED electronics from you again"
"Apple",2,"The thing that saved it was the company at least sent instructions on how to fix the screen. Stinks because it was a gift :("
"Apple",1,"good afternoon, teams are locked and the aspect that is depressing arrived .. there is one that is estillado everything back sulphate is apparently the battery. quisera know we can do about it."
"Apple",3,"when i order this item it says 32gb but when the item is ship it change to 16 gb but the price didn't change..... misleading customers.."
"Apple",1,"I brought as NEW and UNLOCKED for Christmas gift for my mom. It lasts not even a month. Completed OFF! We lost great memories of my newborn baby . I just came from one local apple store and they said that the phone is NOT UNLOCKED AND IT IS NOT NEW either. It cannot be fix because is missing some pieces. - I am very disappoited and sad."
"Apple",1,"HI THE IPHONE WAS BROKEN FROM THE BACK NEAR TO THE CHARGE CONTACT ABOUT 1.5 in . IM SO SAD ABOUT THESE BECAUSE I WASN'T LIKE DESCRIBED AT ALL ."
"Apple",5,"I love the product, arrived on time and not have any damage, I am pleased with the product . OK"
"Apple",2,"The cell works well, however for some reason the charging is a problem. I have to charge while cell is off and it doesn't always work. I have to turn cell off and on several times before it will actually charge. I don't recommend this cell, their are so many more better cells than this one. Keep shopping."
"Apple",5,"love the phone. I can hear others clear as a bell. Just received my phone this week. The music is you can find is great."
"Apple",4,"I've had factory refurbished items before and they did not come with the light scuffs and scratches on the screen (not enough to notice during use, but light scuffs all the same), and the apple ID and password alert continues to pop up with unfamiliar usernames. Other than that and a few light start up bumps, the phone works as good as new. Came with wall charger and cable. Delivered a day early. Would recommend to a friend."
"Apple",3,"I'm happy with the product you received, thank you very much."
"Apple",1,"First of all the phone was not an iPhone 3GS , it is an iphone 3G instead.#2 I could not activate it for some reason by connecting it with iTunes , I've tried dozens of time unsuccessfullyDon't trust this buyer , all they care about is getting customers money"
"Apple",4,"This has been my first i phone so it was a big step up from my last. Highly responsive, bright display, great to store music, finally I'm texting (!)- it's all good. Now that I've had it a bit and I watch my kid facetime on her ipod 4 (which this can't do due to no front facing camera) I realize an i phone 4 probably wouldn't have cost any more or much more. However, it's easy to put a non-contract month to month or pay as you go service on the 3GS, which is why we got it. You might be able to do this on an i phone 4, but the newer the i phones get the trickier the tech' gets to keep you from doing that. Worth 100 bucks for sure."
"Apple",1,"not good as new."
"Apple",5,"ives effective service. works as expected and promptly. good for those in love with iPhone . recommended to all give it a trial"
"Apple",1,"I had an iPhone 3 and I loved it. I've been purchased an iPhone 3 of this website, the battery would not hold its charge it would be at 80 percent and my phone would shut off. this happened every day I charge it every night and I don't think that 80 percent your phone should shut off... and also everytime I try to use the camera the phone would shut off....extremely frustrating I do not recommend this site for phones."
"Apple",1,"Horrible reception. Poor GPS connectivity. Poor GPS accuracy. Constantly loses signal even when outside in a good coverage are. Overall poor phone quality. Although apps work great and makes for a great iPod."
"Apple",4,"Using for a digital music device in my car. Great idea and no complaints about the product itself. It works fine. However, the way the seller packaged it (with no wrapping between device and inside of envelope), I had to clean a lot of sticky adhesive from the envelope out of the headphone jack before I could use it."
"Apple",5,"Great quality product"
"Apple",5,"Came as described, Works perfectly & seller even gave a charger and ear buds so I'm happy with that and also I'm using the device already to leave this review :)"
"Apple",5,"I got this phone for my wife and she loves it."
"Apple",4,"No problems noted!"
"Apple",4,"I bought this phone for my daughter to enable me to keep in contact with a child who has recently moved out of the house but had lost her phone. She seems to be pleased with some of the newer features."
"Apple",4,"Great phone as stated, very fast shipping!"
"Apple",5,"Purchased from Wireless Warehouse, as a gift. It came exactly as described, arrived promptly and in good condition. Hard telling what exactly ""reconditioned"" consisted of, other than not in factory Jewel Box. Hoping a new battery?It came charged, fired right up and easily replaced an older dying 3GS. Time will tell, but so far so good."
"Apple",5,"This phone is in great condition! It looks like it is new!! Beyond what I expected!"
"Apple",5,"My daughter loves it. It is great."
"Apple",1,"Horrible . This was the worst iPhone I've ever bought . I couldn't even connect to MY wifi in the set up . Total waste of money ! The screen was shattered and I couldn't even get past the set up . Don't waste your time with this seller ! Just buy an iPhone 5s at Walmart on Straighttalk for $199 !"
"Apple",1,"I ordered the phone as a bday gift for my son. It got here on time but the battery in the phone was defective. The phone would die completely if the phone's battery reached half-life. I contact the company to get a battery. Living overseas it is not easy replacing a battery for this model and when I purchased it I thought I was purchasing a ""working"" iphone. That was four months ago with no response from the company. Last week the phone did one better, it stopped charging completely and the touch screen literally exploded from the inside out. Although this phone has been in a draw in a protective case for a month when my son was no longer grounded we gave it back to him the touch screen as completely disconnected itself from the phone while the body of the phone was still in the protective case. My son tried to press the screen back into the body of the phone and then the screen cracked. This was a waste of money and time he never got a full months use out of the thing, we were better off just buying him a cheap prepaid phone at least it would have worked."
"Apple",3,"ok i guess."
"Apple",1,"This was the product description 3.5"" display screen, the iPhone 3GS 16GB smartphone gives you a clear view of all the contents and applications. The Wi-Fi connectivity allows you to chat with friends, view your mails, and surf from almost anywhere. The 3.2MP camera lets you capture your favorite moments with amazing clarity. This iPhone features 600 MHz ARM Cortex A8 processor that lets you easily operate various applications at the same time. The 256MB RAM rapidly processes all your files and data.You cannot connect to wi-fi, you guessed it no Wi-Fi connectivity.The iphone did not come with cables, you guessed it, the customer did not said the item will be missing cables."
"Apple",1,"purchased this phone from Ross Cellular via Amazon last May. Has had problems for a couple of months now and is officially broken now. Do not recommend."
"Apple",3,"Very cool phone to have for collection"
"Apple",5,"Phone was in great condition. Works wonderfully. Great to have as a backup phone."
"Apple",2,"worked fine till I lost sound had to buy the bottom charging part for 6 bucks good again"
"Apple",1,"Don't like it period it took forever to get to me and when I did get it I don't like it it was all messed up when I put my sim in it it did not even register I took it ad throw it out"
"Apple",5,"Love this IPhone , although not the most modern model from apple compared to my old motorola phone I had before this phone is like going from day to night big big difference , is worth every dollar I pay , very very happy with this purchase ..I've heard some criticism here in some comments about the phone not being unlocked !! , no problem , at&t is doing it very easy for people who buy old models iphones to unlock any i phone for free !!! if you buy a new older models or used from business like amazon or you buy it from someone else at&t will , unlocked at no charge  I did unlock my purchase for free in the At&t web side if you Iphone is three year old and has no pending contract with at&t and has no history of being stolen or history prematurely canceled contracts from the original owner with at&t this in case you buy a used ) they will unlocked for free !!! ..."
"Apple",5,"The used Apple iPhone 3GS I ordered from Amazon Warehouse is incredible -- just like new! And it is so far superior to the Motorola Atrix I had. Touch works perfectly -- no accidental strokes, no opening something by mistake. Synced with all my info on computer quickly, so now have ALL contact info including ALL phone #s (not just mobile), addresses, & emails. Also calendar info and notes. I have ATT contract, so just inserted SIM and it was up and running. Shipping was fast. Very pleased with purchase."
"Apple",2,"The product did not say that was not unlock, and I am very upset since I have to travel international and do not have more time."
"Apple",4,"The 3G is really, really slow. I didn't want to sign a contract, but I needed a new phone. Perhaps the 3GS is slow compared with the 4 and 4s, but it's plenty fast for everything I need it to do, and being able to pick it up for the price Amazon Warehouse Deals offers it for and not having to sign a contract made this an excellent purchase. My only complaint is that the silence switch is a little wonky, but it is a minor complaint, given that the unit shipped with an immaculate back and screen, and with a sync cable, earbuds, and a wall charger. Highly recommended for those wanting to upgrade from the aging 3G but are wary of signing a new contract with AT&T."
"Apple",5,"I ordered this phone because my old LG prime's touchscreen was starting to become unresponsive. So, I thought why not try out the iphone 3gs, I'd heard good things about it, so I thought I would buy one. I choose to buy it online because everybody knows at&t's prices are ridiculous. So I bought the phone expecting not to get much for only $270. Boy, was I wrong. I got the phone in a nicely wrapped package and they even included a charger. Unfortunately, the phone was locked. But that was not a big problem, I took it to my nearest at&t store and got my number transfered to a new sim card for the phone. All in all I am very happy with my purchase. The phone only had a small scuff mark on the back and the battery is in marvelous condition."
"Apple",5,"This review is not for the product as you may find it everywhere in the www world. This is for the quality of the product that I received from the seller - Amazon Warehouse deals. I bought it used - like new condition. Luckily it came with a version of firmware that is easily unlockable (as I needed a phone to use it overseas). The quality was very good, battery holds well, screen was pristine and there were very minor scuffs and scratches on the back (which should be expected on a used piece). The sockets and ports were well cleaned up and came with NEW headphone, power adaptor and cable !! Highly recommend Amazon warehouse seller for this product."
"Apple",4,"The product was in good structure. I'm still not use it because in Brazil there is to unlock the current version of software."
"Apple",1,"The iPhone was fine. It works and is in good condition but one major thing was wrong with this product!!It was categorized under 'unlocked phones' but when I received it, it was clear that it was LOCKED! I had so much trouble with this phone and to sell a product that is different from the description on such a crucial feature is very very WRONG!"
"Apple",2,"Screen cracked really quick."
"Apple",1,"Will never buy anything again. I received it and did not work. Neither one of them. Then returned them both and they received it. Never got my refund of 89.00 back, like they said it would happen."
"Apple",5,"When I saw that I could buy an apple phone for $35 I thought YAHOO! I have had a series of cheap'/free phones and an apple phone would be the ultimate. Before the phone arrived, I bragged to anyone who would listen. Everyone snickered about it This is a generation 3 phone which basically means it has older technology. I received the phone in less than a week.. It is thicker and the charger is different. The camera is not sophisticated, but it does take pics. No fancy ring tones, but calls are clear. There are limits with this phone, but none that bother me. I am very pleased with this phone."
"Apple",1,"Phone worked but it was scratched pretty bad and it was semi open like if it was dropped bad."
"Apple",2,"i got the phone and it's missing the tray to insert a sim card... it's useless the plus side it looks like it used to belong to a woman and she had ""nice"" pictures"
"Apple",2,"Poor reception"
"Apple",5,"This is a great iPhone for me to use since it is my first iPhone"
"Apple",5,"Great condition, reasonable price and will be buying from them again for my audiobook listening for my classroom! Very impressed!"
"Apple",5,"The phone was better than expected!"
"Apple",5,"Works great"
"Apple",5,"Was exactly what I needed for my daughter :)"
"Apple",5,"good"
"Apple",4,"Got this iPhone for fifty bucks.Yes it's a very old edition, but it still works for the most part. It is a used model, but in good shape..especially the screen,which matters most. The battery life goes quite quick, like in 2 hours with moderate use, a bit more time if standby. I think the battery may need replacing in the near future.I bought a backup battery you plug in..so I am all right, most of e time.You can still get a lot of apps, just not most new ones, as it use iOS 6.?I use the Phone with a provider that is only $15 a month including 400mb of data.Overall I am happy..to have a iPhone. Next year I go up to a 4! I love old school!"
"Apple",5,"Great when I bought it. Use it as an iTouch now."
"Apple",5,"Good phone ..."
"Apple",5,"Excellent and fast shipping"
"Apple",5,"Great deal for the price. The phone has little if any wear and works perfectly."
"Apple",1,"Never really worked wouldn't charge"
"Apple",3,"outdated quickly"
"Apple",4,"The company is lightening quick with shipping and customer service.The only negative issue I've had with this phone is that the battery life is too short. Otherwise, the phone is wonderful and the browser speed is amazing. Great phone, lousy battery life. Not a bad deal at all."
"Apple",3,"good afternoon I received the phone is locked does not recognize the card without my line is movistar sim trajeta says that is not compatible"
"Apple",4,"I am enjoying my new phone. I still have a lot to learn about it. Just bought a new cover for it."
"Apple",5,"they come in ok condition ! but for the price you can complain !! its actually better than good but not very good cosmetic !! always buy from amazon and not 3rd party sellers !"
"Apple",4,"I would have given it a higher rating, but I had to get a SIM card Holder installed on the Phone. Other than that the phone seems to be working fine. Phone is in very good condition and was well packaged."
"Apple",5,"I bought this phone used through the Amazon Warehouse Deals. I wasn't expecting much, but I figured that if anything was wrong, I could simply return it.The box arrived in a few days, and I'm not exaggerating when I say that this phone was just like new. It came in its original packaging, with all of the accessories and manuals, and there were no visible scratches. The only thing that let me know that the phone was used was that the port where the charger goes and the speakers had gotten a little dusty. So, in short, the phone arrived in like-new condition.As for the phone itself, it's worked fine for me so far. I've been using it for about two weeks now, and I haven't encountered any problems. The only complaints I have are about AT&T and their service, not the phone itself. It bears repeating that if you get this phone, it's not unlocked and you're stuck with AT&T. If you can make peace with that, and one is on offer from Warehouse Deals, I highly recommend getting this phone!"
"Apple",4,"I was real nervous about buying an iPhone that was refurbished on-line but I am glad I only paid $100 for this 3G it was a great buy."
"Apple",3,"The phone is in great condition. no scratches , no acting funny , just the cord charger that came with the phone wont charge it. The box works just not the cord. I'm not happy with the charger not working but overall its been good !"
"Apple",5,"Quality was as advertised. An unlock is required before you can use your own SIM. There were no significant scratches and the product was up to standards."
"Apple",5,"I bought that phone it looks real good. I went to a thrift store and found a case to carry it in. It was brand new too. The battery doesn't hold a charge for very long. How long are they suppose to hold a charge? I have not used it yet nor have I went to see if it was unlocked or not. So I am wondering if the battery is good or has to be replaced. This is my first smart phone so I am ""DUH"" on the usage. Oh on the PayPal issue I have been waiting almost a year to get money back from them and that money came from my bank account. I did not use PayPal for payment. So GOOD LUCK. I love Amazon they ROCK!!!!"
"Apple",3,"the iphone 3gs is okay. the battery does not last long. i have to constancely keep it charged. i did receive the phone in a timely manner and the condition was good."
"Apple",2,"I bought this iPhone to replace my old HTC Inspire but all i wound up with was an iPhone that shuts off randomly during use such as my phone calls, or texting so if you want to buy this phone I would reconsider if I were you."
"Apple",5,"bien"
"Apple",4,"Good"
"Apple",1,"Phone doesn't charge. When it is plugged in it is stuck in a loop. Tried to do recovery through iTunes app on computer and it failed before it even began. Worthless junk."
"Apple",3,"good phone"
"Apple",1,"was not so recommended"
"Apple",5,"thank you"
"Apple",4,"This is a great starter phone ,It came within a week and was in excellent condition My brother will have a blast with it"
"Apple",2,"This has been a disspointment. After a few months of usage the phone is not working well and giving problems. Sometimes it boots and other it doesn't. If you buy from this seller you are risking to have the phone go bad in a few weeks."
"Apple",1,"The touch feature would not work properly. Had to turn it sideways to get keys to work. Many times couldn’t even turn phone on to answer calls. Finally fixed it. Threw it on the floor and got another phone. No one else will have to deal with it."
"Apple",5,"I'm happy with the purchase came one month here in Brazil however, I did not realized that the device is locked, so I can not insert my sim card here in Brazil, but I'll try to unlock, and if anyone knows how to unlock for use in Brazil by please help me thank you"
"Apple",2,"I am very disappointed as I ordered an Apple iPhone 3GS 16GB (Black) however received a 3g with model number A1241. All the packaging said that it was a 3gs however the phone itself is a 3g. This is made worse as I am living and working In Africa and had a friend bring it over when he visited."
"Apple",4,"Only after one month the IPhone would no longer charge properly. I have to reset the phone every time I need to charge it. And the charge cord lasted half as long before it fell apart. Over all I love the phone and it was like new when it came in. Highly satisfied."
"Apple",3,"Label on the box included the correct description, Iphone 3gs 16 gb black, however the phone included was a 3g 8gb black in good conditions.Price was good an item was in good condition, included usb cable, wall charger and earphones.Phone was not unlocked."
"Apple",5,"I am happy with this purchase. It was delivered on time. Though it was a used phone, it looked like brand new, wrapped in a plastic, screen in mint condition and hardly any scratches on the back cover. Included were a new wall charger, new usb cable and new headphone. It is functionally perfect, good network, holds battery for just over a day. Overall, a nice buy for the price."
"Apple",1,"horrible. it doesn't even work. no charger and little description about what is in the box of my package. the user only took a picture on the back instead of the screen. i knew something was fishy. don't even know how to return it to get my money back!!!"
"Apple",5,"My phones category was unlocked phones"", but when I received it was locked and it had the second problem too: when I tried to charge phone, on the screen displayed: charging is not supported with this accessory"". With my friends original cable it charged fine. I repaired my phone at the apple dealer and paid $30. Amazon has refund my money and I am very satisfied of its service."
"Apple",5,"Awesome phone. It was neat and doesnt look like used. Easy to acivate and use. Never had issues with it till date. Highly recommended."
"Apple",5,"i wish i had done this 2 yr back ,brand new phone ,stoned noke e5 ,samsung galaxy ( worse phone ) android sucks .every money tight should buy this phone .sound quality is not good as nokia and certain features are missing as comparison to new 4s siri dont works on it ,screen touch is little slow to fluid flow ,so buy a otter box case from amazon its dirt cheap too .so finally very glad i have finally what i wanted .loving it and it will go a long way with me until new iphone 5 came out ."
"Apple",1,"This phone is locked, and thats really a bad way to do business by displaying another label.I cannot afford to come back to US to send it back but I think this would serve as a reminder"
"Apple",1,"I look for an unlocked iphone and this was not. The article said iphone 3gs yet sent me an iphone 3g and I did not pay for it .... this is not right and it is wrong because it is a deception."
"Apple",5,"The product was exactly what I expected. Very Pleased. The phone came with all the original packaging and ""how to"" manual"
"Apple",1,"we had a lot of problems with this iphone from the beginingafter 3 weeks screen went blank could not use it, I sent it back to the vendor, hope i get my money back..."
"Apple",1,"Payed for the iphone on October 9th, October 30th was the latest to arrive from arizona to california and as of today (11-6) I'm still waiting.Of course I tracked it and long story short the product was delivered on 10-22 in Nigeria Africa ... What???!!!That's all I can say about the iPhone 3 I pay for a month ago, I'm hoping by the time it gets here it will be the iPhone 5 insteadBtw, Benjamin from amazon customer service has been great help, he's the positive part of this nightmare.Hopely my son gets compensated for all the frustration every day waiting for the postal service guy to show up bringing his phone."
"Apple",4,"I used it for a long time until my friend sold me his iPhone 4. Now my sister is using my old 3GS. She absolutely loves it. It came in perfect condition and was fast! I still wouldn't trade the 4 for the 3G but I loved the 3G non-the-less."
"Apple",5,"i wantto know if this phone is AT&T )) i want to bay it. please understand. thnx thnx thnx thnx thnx"
"Apple",3,"The phone arrived on time as indicated (That is good !). Phone screen is in good condition so far and the back cover has some scracthes. It is locked, but i have my AT&T SIM ready. As of now, the only thing that trouble me is the missing pin that use to open the SIM slot, the rest of the functions work just fine. I shall try to post more of this phone review, so stay tune."
"Apple",3,"Have had issues with ""no service"" several times, so far made 3 trips to AT and T.Replaced sim card and does not hold charge well. We keep hoping the issues will stop, still not sure if we will keep or return."
"Apple",1,"The phone appeared to be in good condition, but it is defective. It's difficult to hear. I thought it was the plastic over the phone but it wasn't & didn't realize it until a few weeks after i purchased the phone."
"Apple",1,"First off i put in my sim card and it wouldn't read it for like a whole night. it kept saying searching but wouldn't read it. When it finally read it the problem was it kept turning off randomly even though i was at 70% . Waste of $190"
"Apple",1,"Volume buttons dont work, sim card slot broken charging slot at times not functional, alot of freezing when phone is on and five cracks om the back"
"Apple",5,"I bought this phone as being unlocked. It wasn't. I called at&t and they registered my simms card and went to turn it on. Nothing! Why? It needs a simms card with unlocked pin? At&T didn't know what I was talking about? Nice phone to look at. So I'm going to try to take it to the corporate At&t store and then probably to Apple Store. I will give a better review after I drive a hour to these stores. Check out my new review. Didn't have to drive. grreat Phone! clear reception and voice. No problems. Yes I woould recommend this seller 100%"
"Apple",4,"I'm happy with this phone. I really like the speed delivery of this phone. Finally I have an iPhone I love love using this"
"Apple",5,"Wish we had purchased 2 of these instead of just one. It has plenty of room to download several movies and shows for the grandchildren."
"Apple",5,"Phone condition was like new every button works good also arrived in good time,as indicated,I would recommend buying this phone,at this price compared too!!!"
"Apple",2,"What I said in the beggining: It's brand new as described! I am now getting my unlock code from AT&T. Thank you guys for the lowest price iphone! I would highly recommend this seller and the product to my friends!After 3 months: The iphone still works, but it started to freeze randomly. Sometimes it shutsdown eventhough the battery is at 80 to 100%. It doesn't turn on, no matter what you do. Then somehow, it randomly turns on after 30 to 40 mins. Since I am a technician, I would say it is the case of refurbrished items. It is not the ""brand new"" item as listed. At my best guess, I would say these are the refurbrished items that are left over from carriers such as AT&T and verizon and later sold to third party sellers. CHEAP BUSINESS! I HIGHLY RECOMMEND NOT TO BUY THIS ITEM!!!"
"Apple",2,"We had to go get another batter for it and after battery installation, it never worked very well. Always needed to be plugged in."
"Apple",4,"I lost my 5G so I had to buy this one to replace it. It's almost as good!! I never used the Seri anyway."
"Apple",1,"The product that I received from this seller was non-functioning. I was promised a fully working iPhone 3GS 16g..however upon arrival I noticed immediately that the phone would not sync with iTunes. So I took it in to the Apple store, and they notified me that the internal antenna was broken.Complete waste of time and money. On top of that, I am still waiting for my refund."
"Apple",1,"Had to take it to an apple store to get it to work. They said it was so bad inside I should trade it in.So it cost me to get it fixed big time. It was sold as refurbished, had to be a bold face lie.It's a wonderful product but the seller grossley misrepresented it. Refurbished means it works right?"
"Apple",1,"I am very disappointed with this product. not because of physical appearance or whatever, but because of lack of arrival. It was supposed to get here by the 23rd of December, but I still haven't gotten it at the start of 2014. I wish I could give zero stars."
"Apple",5,"I bought this phone for my daughter, great phone even thought it's an older model, it's GREAT, service was also GREAT"
"Apple",1,"Worked good for one year it lasted and then it showed that what it means to buy a refurbished product! Isn't this what is always expected with refurbished products. Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice, shame on me."
"Apple",1,"Not at all as advertised. This was a gift for a friend and She didn't tell Me about the problems until I saw the phone in use out of the box. She didn't want to seem ungrateful. besides the damage to the phone there are some functionality issues. So to anyone out there... check the phone well. power it on.. don't just listen to Amazon if they say ""like new""!!!! No one checks these things out to see if they really work.. they just go on the disclosures of the last owner. If they don't check the phone( and this goes mostly for the 3rd party sellers) then they don't know of any issues... allowing them to sell the phone as ""like new"". Just lettin You know..."
"Apple",3,"Product was exactly as described. There were no dents. The housing reflected only light wear and tear and the screen itself was flawless. The quality of customer service fell a bit short of 100%. Otherwise, my rating would have another star. From now on, I will stick to purchasing all accessories from the Apple store."
"Apple",3,"Phone worked great! Only issue was that it wouldn't charge. Something was bent small repair made and it works like a charm"
"Apple",5,"This is a great product, it worth its price. The phone can do as much as all of the other iPhones out there."
"Apple",3,"Works well except for the battery which doesn't hold a charge well. Loses power much more quickly than other 3GS units I've owned. Shuts off with ~15% left. Yes, i calibrate the battery regularly. It doesnt help. Based on its shaky battery life and power quirks, I don't think this phone will be working much longer, so I feel a bit cheated."
"Apple",5,"IPhone 3gs is a solid smartphone. It is relatively light and compact. It has a premium feel and it is just beautiful. The battery lasts all day long on reasonably heavy used with screen brightness at 70-80 per cent. Call quality is solid and antenna reception is consistent."
"Apple",1,"The phone had pretty heavy scratches on the front and back, plus the back part was all cracked! The phone restarts itself all the time and the battery lasts 2 hous top! I bought it from Amazon Warehouse and definitely would NOT buy it again."
"Apple",5,"I finally decided to get a smart phone and this iPhone 3GS is perfect for me. Has more features than those on the 3 and almost as much as the 4.For a retired person like myself, it is perfect. The iPhone 3GS was brand new and unlocked as stated. I set it up on Consumer Cellular phone and data service and I will be using it in Europe with a European SIM card for phone, # and data there.It works perfectly. Loved it so much we bought another for my spouse!NO DISAPPOINTMENT OR DISSATISFACTION HERE!VERY PLEASED!"
"Apple",1,"producto no se recibio su empaque ni con sus accesorios originales, adicional se recibio con la tarjeta logica dañada la pantalla se queda en blanco, tengo un pisapapelesProduct not received your package or with their original accessories, additional logic card received with damaged screen goes blank, I have a paperweight"

"Apple",5,"come early than expected and i got a new product, do not know its a used one and i need to buy 2 more"
"Apple",5,"I needed to replace my iPhone 3GS since it wouldn't recognize the charger & my computer wouldn't recognize the phone when plugged into it for downloads. This phone is bettter than the one I got from AT&T!!!"
"Apple",5,"I love it and the price is very good for the iPhone I recomend any body who intrest on it purchase the out any doubt.Manny Depina"
"Apple",4,"The only thing I wish is that AT&T & Apple would work out a data service, because I cannot use my unlimited data on my new iPhone."
"Apple",4,"Overall, I changed my mind. While the phone wasn't as described, it's not bad at all. I do still have to clean it up a bit from the adhesive, but it's not a big deal, especially for such a low price. Customer service was excellent. The problem was resolved with a partial refund for it's condition, and I'm happy with that."
"Apple",1,"First of all it wasnt match what its says on website. It was internally broken phone and it wasnt unlock."
"Apple",3,"good afternoon I received the phone is locked does not recognize the card without my line is movistar sim trajeta says that is not compatible"
"Apple",5,"The iPhone 3GS 16gb I bought arrived in good condition and the phone look brand new. This is the trustworthy every person should have when buying a product got my product from ctphone. Gladly to do business and everyone should too. Great value and prices too. Excellent job.-Ashley"
"Apple",5,"Perfect for beginner iPhone user..Thank you very much."
"Apple",5,"Thanks"
"Apple",1,"This phone broke within a week. Not a great item. The whole screen just cracked because when I received it in the mail and when I opened it, it had a small crack onto it cause it wasn't packaged the right way"
"Apple",5,"EXCELENTE"
"Apple",5,"Works great!!"
"Apple",5,"fine"
"Apple",4,"It's pretty good for a old cell."
"Apple",5,"No problems. Phone look'd brand new!"
"Apple",5,"Amazing and fast...Thank you!!!!!"
"Apple",5,"Yes, the used iPhone 3GS works the way it should. I actually received two for the price of one. Also, both iPhones works with any SIM card that I putted."
"Apple",1,"bid for the purchase of an iphone 3gs 16gb, and they sent me was a iphone 3g 16gb with case broken in one corner and locked when the advert says this factory unlocked and it is a 3gs"
"Apple",5,"I'm a senior citizen and have been puzzled by many of the newer phones so I started out slow with the I-phone 3G. I knew right away I should have gone all the way and purchased the newest one. It has been so easy to learn. I recommend it to anyone"
"Apple",4,"works amazing, sooo fast and love IOS7 , its super fast and i love SIRI being on it with the new update."
"Apple",1,"I wouldn't even give it one star. I got this phone for my mother. She loved it but it wouldn't charge so had to send it back!"
"Apple",5,"Item was as described. Like new in the original box and packaging, with plastic protective sheet across screen, immaculate, with headphones and all papers and manual. It works just like my original 3GS (which served me for 5 years). Fantastic!"
"Apple",5,"Pros and consI will start with the cons: I forgot that the 3GS did not have siri. That was my fault, and because its an older model. and is on the newest firmware; the battery life is not all that great. 7 hours of use before it dies.Other reviews state that this company is shipping 3G phones instead of 3Gs.At first i thought the same thing until I called my carrear, and gave them the model number. They confirmed it was 3GS.Pros.Item arrived extremly quickly :-)As advertised it was brand new in box un-opened. :-)With moderate use, without the use of GPS, or downloading apps. Canging settings from 3G to 2G noticably increases the battery life.Over all i am extremly happy with my purchase."
"Apple",3,"Currently it is 2014, the 3gs is discontinued. However most of the apps I want are still working for it. Other reviews were full of lists that didnt work, but I tried them on the 3gs I got recently and the ones that didnt work were usually ones I didnt expect to work. Youtube,bbc News, Google Maps, GPS apps, Amazon Prime video, kindle books. All of these apps worked fine with no errors. As well as Final Fantasy Dimensions. I would expect most games not to work in this, but the only ones I've tried are FFD and Bejeweled which work fine. As for the phone itself, the screen is small and its sometimes not very reactive."
"Apple",2,"This phone was a replacement used by my daughter.When received she told me the phone wouldn't take andkeep a charge. I was told to put the phone on Airplane modeto charge. It never made a difference."
"Apple",1,"I ordered the 16GB model, but was sent the 8GB model instead. I contacted them via amazon, but haven't heard back from them since.If I wanted the 8GB model, I would have saved a lot of money and ordered it originally."
"Apple",4,"I like my Apple iPhone . This make me able to contact my friends in easy and fast way. The thing that I do not like is the sound of coming call that I barely hear the other side even I put the sound on high level. In addition, this cellphone has clear screen and all icons are under my touch. I showed this Apple iPhone to all my friends and they asked me from where I got it. They surprised that how much I saved because I bought it from Amazon.com, Thanks Amazon.com"
"Apple",1,"The phone never even showed up.The online tracking said that it was supposed to arrive on the 19th, approximately a week or so after I first ordered it.The phone was a gift, so when it never arrived I was forced to go out and buy one myself (which was thankfully about 75% cheaper than this product).Luckily, the company was very apologetic and refunded my money after I reported the package to them.WARNING!!! The manufacturer themselves admitted that it was not the first time the packages had been shipped and suddenly vanished. They said they'd had this issue on multiple occasions. Save your time and money."
"Apple",4,"I like this phone. It cable a week later, but it works well. It was classified as new, but if came with scratches on the back. Very few, though."
"Apple",5,"The phone is In like new condition, better than expected. Very nice case ear phones charger and data cable included."
"Apple",5,"Love apple iphones, I've had 3. bought this one as a gift to bring my parents into the technology era."
"Apple",3,"phone works just fine, just don't drop it from any, and i mean any, height without a protective cover on it first. Dropped mine from 1 foot on to tile and the case cracked apart at the front and back seam."
"Apple",4,"I was so excited to get this phone although right away I had to have it repaired which was $50.00. I did not even have a clue that it would need to be unblocked until I purchased the right stuff to activate the phone and could not use it. So I am very disappointed that I have to spend more money to get it unblocked so in the long run I can only use it now to play games. I will not be buying any other phone at all from Amazon and I have purchased alot of things from this website."
"Apple",5,"These phones looked like they were brand new. My granddaughters loved them. Thanks! Plus they came with new chargers and USB connectors."
"Apple",5,"I didnt want to spend hundreds of dollars on an IOS device for my 13 year old. This iPhone does everything the latest touch will do-almost. If she is responsible enough and can take care of this, then we will move up."
"Apple",2,"its automatically turns off . i tried to charge but its still doing. every day its turning automatially and does not turns on.. i wait that 15 minut.. :("
"Apple",4,"it gives you an iPhone experience"
"Apple",5,"My wife uses this phone now. Works great,"
"Apple",1,"I ordered this phone for my husband and it would not work in the mountains in southeastern Oklahoma where we live and I still have it can I send it back with case and glass jprotectors"
"Apple",1,"New update- I should have just returned this piece of crap. It no longer functions unless it is plugged in. It turns off constantly from something as simple as I am typing a text and receive a text at the same time. not pictures, just text, and the phone is not loaded up with anything, I don't have games or videos. It is simply a garbage phone. I did not heed the waning signs, I really wanted it to work, but alas, it doesn't.Update - I did not get a chance to change back over to my old cracked phone, but in the meantime I left the new one on a charger for a whole day and now it seems to be working fine. Perhaps they should include an instruction to do this before using the phone (although, I have never had another phone glitch out like that and not want to charge or take a full day to complete one full charge, so it still makes me think twice about keeping it)... For now I am updating my review to 3 stars and keeping the phone because I just don't have the energy to go through another 3rd party seller return. Hopefully I don't regret it...Just received this phone and in the last 24 hours it doesn't seem to get to full charge no matter how long it is plugged in. It has also turned off randomly at least 25 times during use and you turn it back on and it turns off a few more times before staying on for a couple hours, but as soon as it is being used to do anything it glitches and turns off within a few minutes. All I've done is text on it and read a few online articles, I don't even have apps or a ton of stored things, so no reason to glitch like this."
"Apple",5,"perfect"
"Apple",5,"very good"
"Apple",1,"no work, i do not recomend this item and the seller."
"Apple",3,"bien"
"Apple",2,"Wouldn't let me upgrade to the newest software for Iphones."
"Apple",1,"Unusable"
"Apple",5,"Very happy with the two iPhones we bought!"
"Apple",5,"thnx"
"Apple",4,"very happy with my purchase, very good quality for that price."
"Apple",1,"When I got the phone it had no sound. When calling someone they could not hear me. The phone was also covered in gunk"
"Apple",5,"This item meet my expectation . very good item work properly .Thank you ."
"Apple",3,"The provider did not specify that the phone had damaged battery and casing rotates why I give this punctuation"
"Apple",1,"never worked. didn't ring, dropped numbers. I hated it but couldn't afford to change to a different smart phone. My husband finally convinced me to get a dumb phone and stop being so upset by a piece of junk"
"Apple",5,"commend good product"
"Apple",1,"Had water damage, got screwed!"
"Apple",5,"yes my costumer was so very satisfy to yhis unit"
"Apple",4,"I got the iPhone in less than 24 hours ,no original iPhone box was in it ,some scratches on back ,screen perfect iPhone locked to at&t."
"Apple",5,"My iPhone works like new. It looks better than the description. Phone was unlocked, and ready to use! I love it. & I got it for a great price!!! I recommend it."
"Apple",5,"Absolute Value for money and this is what I expected from Amazon !.I received in neat packaging with all necessary accessories required."
"Apple",3,"I Just received the product, but i am really unable to know if it is working. The SIM CARD TRAY is missing. I can not insert the SIM CARD.Amazon adressed the issue ok so far."
"Apple",5,"my first 3G came severely discounted with the initial 2yr plan. 8mths later it was stolen. i didnt realize i couldnt purchas another at the same 'discounted' price. it was $3-400 to replace it.i got the identical phone through amazone for $150. i've yet to tell any difference, other than i use my password lock and my ""find my phone"" app...after i was told by AT&T and apple they 'couldnt trace' my original phone without it (which i dont believe). but either way...i'm 'older', not the most techy person, and probably i dont use the phone to its fullest potential, yet. but it serves my purpose thus far, and i have no complaints, yet. seemingly as with most smart phones, its made to be dropped (very slick and sleek) so i HIGHLY suggest purchasing some sort of silicone wrap for ease of grip or some 'hard cover' to protect it from when you drop it. its not a matter of IF, but when. the first one i didnt drop AT ALL for 8mths. i dropped the 2nd one twice in one week...but thankfully it was protected."
"Apple",4,"works very well, for the most part, but its unlocked so it took a little effort to get picture messaging to work and after every 5-7 texts or every phone call, I have to turn it off and back on to get signal."
"Apple",5,"Bought this used locked GSM iPhone 3GS 16GB for two reasons:1. it's sold by trust-worthy Amazon WarehouseDeals2. it's advertised that product was ""From the Manufacturer""Received the phone in excellent shape, well packed, like new, with the latest 5.0 firmware. It came with a new set of genuine Apple earphones with remote and mic, dock connector to USB cable and USB power adapter. Touchscreen and battery seemed to be newly replaced as well!Googled around, selected a company on the internet that claimed to be the No. 1 iPhone unlock service provider; after payment to them, received from them a message claiming that ""software was being developed and would be available soon (without a commitment date when software will be available)"". Since then, I've never been able to get my money back through PayPal!Fortunately, there's a professional independent iPhone repair shop in town (not at&t, T-Mobile or Cincinnati Bell) who could help activate, jailbreak and unlock my phone; the phone works great now! I don't have to purchase a 2-year plan, I can use the best-deal package plan I want from either at&t, T-Mobile or Cincinnati Bell any time. One important note: NEVER update your firmware after the unlock, otherwise, everything will be reset to previous locked configuration!"
"Apple",3,"The phone is nice condition, almost looks new but it is not unlocked! I have not had any luck unlocking it yet, but remain hopeful!"
"Apple",1,"I bought this iphone and discovered that it is LOCKED to AT&TDon't BUY , I am returning it back to Amazon warehouse !!!"
"Apple",5,"Had to order twice, first time I received incorrect product, but customer service was GREAT and handled everything expeditiously....my son loves it!"
"Apple",4,"The iphone 3GS works perfectly with one exception. I purchased this product in ""like new"" condition. There were no scratches or blemishes at all. All the programming works great. My one complaint is the menu button at the bottom. It does not 'click' crisp at all. When you press it it feels like there is something jammed in it below the surface. It's not bad enough to return, but does not earn 5 stars either."
"Apple",5,"Opened box, charged battery, upgraded to the latest software, off and running. It was the perfect gift to someone who had never had a smart phone before. These 3gs feel great in the hand vs the boxy 4s & 5. Bayshine trading inc. was prompt in delivering and then re-delivering when my sister who was surprised to receive it returned by mistake. Una Stewart"
"Apple",2,"The accessories did not work (hand free, the charger), I ought to replace new items. I am angry about that."
"Apple",5,"love the seller for selling it so cheap bets thing about it it was factory unlocked but what really special what that it had the old bootrom which meant i could have a untethered jailbreak on ios 6.0.1 came with everything except the cables and charger."
"Apple",4,"it is great looks brand new but it freezes sometimes and wont charge but that is to be expected.. great!"
"Apple",5,"Exactly as I expected! No surprises and works/functions like an excellent minimally used mac-buttons cheaper than a new one!"
"Apple",3,"It's a bit slow for what it is, nowadays, and most software only barely gets to it. It's somewhat slow, but still fairly powerful. However, be sure that you're getting a factory unlocked phone. Several sellers are selling them as simply iphones, but if you try using a different sim card, it won't work, or it was hacked to allow this. So be sure of what you're getting!"
"Apple",2,"i purchased this phone trusting that it is really unlocked. Apparently Amazon doesn't really check these things. I am outside the country now and cant make any calls as i keep getting invalid sim message. And then to make it worse,its a dead battery.Only a red battery line shows on the screen and this makes the phone trip off after 2 minutes. I'm so sad"
"Apple",2,"I received this phone a few weeks ago and it has not been good. First when i get it out of the box the ringer/mute switch doesn't work, when the seller claimed it did. Then i find that the phone dies at 50% battery. The seller said they had no problems and it worked great. Well, mine doesn't sound like a very functional phone. I was indifferent about the broken mute/ringer switch, but then to only be able to use it for only 50% battery, is just really unusable as a phone, or even an iPod for that matter. Be careful and ask a lot of questions! Make sure you buy from a trusted seller."
"Apple",2,"The iPhone was put on the website in very good condition,butIt was in terrible internally I had to get a new battery and theBattery got so stretched out it bent the motherboard so it shuts on and off randomlyAlso the back of it is melted ffrom the battery and now it doesn't work at all aand he didn't offer to pay the 75 dollarsWorth of work I had put into it or half a refund would be nice"
"Apple",5,"This was a gift to my son and he has loved it from the moment he received it. He's currently taking college classes in Cincinnati and it allows him to stay in touch with family and friends.My son loves Apple products and enjoys listening to downloaded music on his new Apple iPhone 3GS and the 16 GB gives him enought space to keep a nice library of music.I would recommand Amazon to everyone that is looking for a replacement or new smart phone"
"Apple",1,"Ordered unlocked, it's locked by a French carrier and it has a water spot under the screen! Can't believe I fell for this! Don't do it!"
"Apple",1,"product was blocked, the serial number of the box does not match with serial number of thephone, the ear-phone was not original. The product was manufactured in 2010.The product was returned and already refunded"
"Apple",4,"Very good phone. 16GB a big plus. Would have given a 5-star rating if it wasn't for the slight slow down when running iOS6"
"Apple",5,"It's exactly what we expected. Works great and was in the condition it was supposed to be in according to the ad. This item was part of a customer service adjustment from Amazon due to an earlier order problem."
"Apple",2,"This product is disappointing. It is locked and has a big crack at the back. The OS is also ancient."
"Apple",1,"Hello. I order you white phone. But you sent me black one. Can you tell me what happend. if u dont help me I will hate you.........I,m waiting your answer.sisinserly levani............."
"Apple",1,"Totally Bummed....Was a Christmas present for my son and the letter 'E' doesn't work. It now sits in the drawer..Useless!"
"Apple",2,"I bought this phone specially because it was described as UNLOCKED. When I received my phone everything was ok until I put the SIM card, phone didn't work and I had to pay initially US15 to unlock the phone, next day when I tried to download applications I couldn't because the phone was not updated to ISO 4.3 or plus. Then I had to pay US$25 to update the phone to IOS 6.0 and unlock the phone for ever. I contacted the seller and he replied saying how he could help I told him to refund the initial $15 dollars I spent he replied just saying he didn't know how to refund the money and never replied to any of my following emails. In fact the phone was in really good condition but locked I had to pay totally $154 + $40 to repair. No happy with the shopping and the seller"
"Apple",5,"The phone came in its original box together with all its accessories: no scratches or dents. The phone looks as though it were brand new. It was on IOS 5 and the baseband was an unlockable one. I eventually managed to get an unlocked baseband on 6.0.1 without much trouble. Great purchase!"
"Apple",1,"The phone does not hold a charge at all.I cant take it off the charger or it will die even when it says 100%"
"Apple",5,"So it's not the newest phone out there, so what. This phone was cheaper than getting an iPod of same GB size. It's an apple product so good support, good apps."
"Apple",5,"This classic iPhone has the old school shape and weight, with plenty of performance. I'm one for simplicity and the classic 3GS is a solid buy."
"Apple",5,"It performs great. I would recommend it to anyone that wants an iphone, but can't afford the latest one out there."
"Apple",1,"Product in good condition but incomplete, because i miss miss accessories had the doubt if so go on and buy it had bought a better one because i had to make additional spending"
"Apple",4,"got just like they said and im happy with it however it was missing the on/off switch cover and I had to have that repaired but my otter box cover is the only thing that keeps it in place- phone looks and works fine but I was a tad disappointed with the missing part"
"Apple",5,"I bought this phone for my son & he loves it especially it's being his first iPhone. Great product at a great price. Item arrived at the time it said it would"
"Apple",1,"On the description for the iphone It said it didnt work but could be fixed but it wasnt coming on and you didnt drop it or do anything to it! but i took it to the shop to be fixed and they said that it had water damage to it and could not be fixed! :-("
"Apple",4,"Both the phones where in nearly new condition. However few days latter battery of one of the phone become like balloon and braking most of the internal parts. the front glass came out etc.."
"Apple",1,"I was fooled by the item description. It was totally below expectations. I could not even use the phone. Seems that they were just trying to place a broken phone to innocent buyers..."
"Apple",1,"Phone came with screen popped out, but still working, and a scratch on the back. A day later, the phone screen was completely popped out. Sending it back as soon as possible."
"Apple",1,"Everything about the purchase was good except the battery. The item was delievred quickly, it came with all the accesories and in good condition. However, there were big issues with the batter. The battery life of the phone was terrible, if I listened to music for a hour or so right after charging the phone I would have to recharge it immediatly....same with intensive texting....and somehimes battery said 50% and it would just shut off receiving a phone call....the cell phone shut off on me so many times that I had to keep it plugged in....which entirely defeats the purpose of having a phone! I would strongly suggest that before you buy a used cell phone you ask the seller about the battery. In the end I returned the phone and they were quick with the refund. I give them one star because everything was good, except the phone!!"
"Apple",3,"I guess for the price the condition wasnt THAT bad, but i was really hoping for better, few visible scratches on the screen and back, but other than cosmetics the phone works pretty well, bought it for my mom. if you just need a phone like this and could careless about the cosmetics then id recomend it (bought it from amazon warehouse or something) otherwise i'd invest in a better looking phone youd probably get a little more for your money. i paid 120 to 130 or something. Good over all, but wished for better."
"Apple",5,"This product is very good, and it is what I like to buy it, and it is a very good deal!"
"Apple",5,"aside from the usual wear and tear scratches, all works just fine, its awesome!! and it got here on time soooo goooddd!!!! thanks for being trustworthy...definitely buying with you in future"
"Apple",5,"The phone works great and arrived quickly. This is a used product and I'm very happy with it. No problems."
"Apple",2,"Though the phone came packaged in a box and bubble wrapping, the upkeep of the phone was worn and scratched up.All of the open sockets had dirt in them.I was disappointed with the purchase."
"Apple",5,"We got this for our 15 year old for Christmas--his first phone. He's as happy as a clam and so are we. My only complaint against the iPhone is that the battery can't be replaced by ordinary humans. But it does good stuff and it always works."
"Apple",4,"my iphone is working good but the power button is acting up but everything else is working right thank you for the iphone"
"Apple",5,"the iphone was as described it was excellent i`m trying to unlock it`s off contract AT&T , really good iphonethis seller is really good and fast service"
"Apple",2,"Unfortunately, this did not turn out to be as good as originally thought.We discovered the phone would not hold a charge beyond a couple of hours, no matter usage time. Apparently the battery was bad, and we didn't want to invest the cost, which we understand is substantial, for having it replaced. Thank goodness for Amazon's excellent return policy."
"Apple",5,"I bought this phone for my daughter's birthday and she loves it! She had it activated within 5 minutes after I gave it to her and it's working great!"
"Apple",3,"Its a very good phone. The applications that comes in it are great. It help me to get organized: the clock with the convinience to set different alarms, the calendar for the appointments, the camera and the application to write notes. Those are my favorites. Another favorite is the ease to download applications like the Bible (daily devotional) and the calorie counter and GPS.My only disappointment was that it came with a crack in the back side of the phone (about an inch of long!). Its not noticeable since I use it with a cover.Otherwise I would have rated it with 5 stars.By the way I was wondering if it would work in Puerto Rico with Net 10 phone service... yes it does!"
"Apple",5,"This phone was in excellent condition and it was shipped fast. It was the best deal we could find on the older 3G model and I needed one fast because mine bit the dust."
"Apple",4,"I bought this phone for my son as a tester to see how he would do with an ""expensive"" phone. It was cheap and worked just fine. It is obviously slower than the newer iPhones, but I wasn't ready to purchase one of those for my son just yet."
"Apple",1,"The phone cuts off at65 percent, the camera doesn't work. I'm very disappointed in the phone. It's supposed to be a phone in good condition, it's not!"
"Apple",1,"Hello this message is for reporting touting an Iphone like new , and received iphone with detached screen, the screen has a line of liquid in the center and on top of that the device turns off after 30 minutes of use and you have to have it connected to the charger it will not fade._________________________Buenos días, el presente mensaje es para informar que promocionaban un Iphone como nuevo y me llegó un iphone con la pantalla despegada, la pantalla tiene una raya de líquido en el centro y aparte de eso el dispositivo se apaga luego de 30 minutos de uso y hay que tenerlo conectado al cargador para que no se apague."
"Apple",3,"Works nice. All the buttons work good. I love the side switch where I can just lock it and it turns the volume off instead of going into the settings and taking longer. However it does shut off when there is still half battery life left. And sometimes when I am in the middle of an app/game it shuts off as well. But other then that its nice because its a working phone"
"Apple",1,". The phone didnt work. Kept shutting off while in apps. It wouldn't turn back on unless hooked up to the charger. Sent it back this morning."
"Apple",4,"Seems to be as described and in great condition! Arrived on time But without promised case and the sync cord was super cheap but I didn't really buy it for that purpose. The phone is very good and that is certainly what counts!"
"Apple",1,"My phone worked when I first got it after trying to update phone went dead now won't turn back on"
"Apple",5,"I could not tell this phone had ever been used before I got it - it is in perfect shape and it works very well. It is much faster than the 3G, and I also like the white color of the phone.I recommend this for anyone who wants an iPhone but doesn't want to shell out the big bucks for the latest model. Great phone, good deal."
"Apple",5,"I got the phone in record time! When I first got the phone everything was as described, now when I got the phone and set it up it worked great, then it started shutting down by it self and wouldn't turn back on unless I plugged it in, now as a technitian myself I new the battery was bad so I contacted the seller and he was very assertive and quick to fix issue, he offered to send me another phone but I couldn't be without my phone so, I told him I bought a new battery to put in it, so then he offered to refund the amount of the battery and shipping cost! He was very quick and responsive to my needs and I am very pleased. I also put new battery in phone works great! I am thinking of buying another iPhone 3GS for my mother and this company will be the one I most definitely will be going through hands down! Also the iPhone was packaged in original box with factory paperwork and the charge cable, and came with a otter box defender case and earphones! Very satisfied!"
"Apple",4,"I needed to replace an old 3G iPhone that was having too many problems to keep fixing. The 3GS added 8GB of memory, a better camera, runs on the current operating system and still fits the old case that I didn't want to replace. If the battery life was a little better this would have had 5 stars, but the battery is a bit weak. (Not surprising for a used iPhone, however.)"
"Apple",5,"excellent everything arrived on time without inconvenienceI recommend it. thanks for product safety . from venezuela thanksbye bye"
"Apple",1,"hello.I made ​​the purchase of wireless equipment iphone 3gs, it is locked by AT & T, also just told me via phone that it can not be unlocked by having no bill authorized agent at & t and additionally it is reported as being stolen .I request that you are sending to another device (unlocked, and legal bill at & t) or my money back via giftcard or similar.I'm from Venezuela, so the shipment and return the equipment I find difficult, but not impossible, so I requested to indicate which way to send your unit and I point out when I sent mine."
"Apple",5,"Havent had a chance to activate for use yet but i was happy with how it was packaged nicely to prevent any crcks or damages.so this review is mostly for how nicley packaged it was..Thanks!"
"Apple",1,"I bought it a week ago and was dissatisfied, when I brought It to apple store, they said, this is not original phone!"
"Apple",5,"excelentes 100% recomendados el paqueyte llego en el tiempo establecido y en perfecto estado.el cell trabaja perfecta mente y muy contento por la compra"
"Apple",5,"I love this nifty phone because i can unlock it and then use another carrier of GSM like T-mobile. This is something i will have until ios 7 comes out since iphone 3gs wont support it. To make this even more special amazon sells these phones and apple doesnt or other companies since semtember 2012 these iphones are for sale in store. In the package came the Iphone itself, a sim card removal tool, New Earphones, and a New USB connector. Overall I am happy with this iphone until IOS 7 comes out then i will upgrade."
"Apple",5,"Good"
"Apple",5,"This iPhone is for my colection of iPhones I started and I could not be more pleased. The Iphone3GS was refurbushed, had no problem getting it unlocked by AT&T. The phone does not have a single scratch on it, it looks brand new. Very pleased."
"Apple",5,"Niceee"
"Apple",1,"the description was NEW but when we got it, it didn't hold service so I took it to AT&T and the APPLE store and the pulled the serial # and saw the phone was purchased 5 years ago."
"Apple",5,"Great"
"Apple",1,"The phone would not get service. I purchased 3 phone s on amazon. Only one was not hacked. I will not buy another phone on amazon."
"Apple",1,"Very bad"
"Apple",1,"This phone is a real disappointment. I can not get onto the internet unless I am at an establishment that has WIFI. So this phone is useless to me. Now I have to buy another phone that is in working condition this is the first time I have ever had a problem buying a phone on Amazon."
"Apple",5,"very good"
"Apple",3,"I am having problems with the charger hookup. Is difficult to hook the charger"
"Apple",3,"Perfect for my husband. He calls and texts and this fits the bill."
"Apple",3,"The company gave me a refund without any problems. Exceptional service.The phone is worse than worthless.I used to think apple products were better because I never owned any of them.I wanted to find out if iPhones were really as good as people say they are.I've been a programmer, technician, electronic engineer, satellite communications specialist, phone network specialist, and datacenter network management specialist, before I retired in 2001, and I figured out how to do everything I want with android phones easily when I got my first one in 2010.I couldn't do anything with this.First I had to drive all over the city to find a sim card because it won't even let you use it on wifi without one and it took hours of trying different places because apple changes stuff like that with every new model just so their customers can't keep using their old accessories when they buy a new phone.When I got into it I couldn't get it to do anything.It was perfectly functional but it wouldn't do anything I wanted to do. Even the simplest things I do easily on every windows android or Linux device I've ever used.Of course every Microsoft OS has been extremely badly designed and Android sucks in its own ways, and haven't used Linux enough to have an opinion about it.But ios is the worst I've ever seen.With that and the nonremovable battery which will stop working in about a year and hardly any storage, I wouldn't use this phone they paid me."
"Apple",1,"It said in the description stating that it was in great condition with only a few minor scratches. I understood that and was fine with that. But, what I also got was a battery that is expanding so much that its cracking the phone. The battery is so expanded that it wont keep a charge or even stay powered on. Cant even use the phone"
"Apple",5,"Purchased for my niece. She loves the iphone."
"Apple",5,"Exactly as Described. Used for a few months and then Resold for cost price"
"Apple",2,"Phone can in good/great condition however u can't use it without a SIM card. I brought it for my son for music n couldn't use it with get caught up in some contact with my carrier. Kinda a waste of money"
"Apple",5,"fast shipping and exactly what was stated in the description"
"Apple",1,"Camera doesn't work."
"Apple",5,"Everything that I expected...Thanks Fast Shipping as well..."
"Apple",4,"All went well Thanks"
"Apple",5,"Love it"
"Apple",5,"Was the best"
"Apple",1,"when i recieved the phone the sim card reader was not working and phone would not get passed activation setup screen"
"Apple",1,"The particular phone I got, Well it exploded after it's first Charge! I'm glad it wasn't on my son at the time. I believe he may have gotten hurt!"
"Apple",5,"good"
"Apple",1,"I don't like it because I need ios 7 upgrade and it wont let me upgrade to it so now I need to buy another new phone that will take the ios 7 upgrade"
"Apple",2,"I paid over $200 for a 16 gb phone and ended up getting an 8 gb."
"Apple",5,"It's beautiful,no real scratches,no cracks.But I may be sending it back,can't access Amazon account on it,or Facebook😱"
"Apple",5,"runs soooooooo smoth"
"Apple",1,"False advertising . It was stating the phone was factory unlocked and I called in to make sure I was getting the product as advertise the customer service rep assured me I would received factory unlocked phones and it doesn't seems like no 3rd party people wanted to touch the phones to try and unlocked them."
"Apple",1,"Horrible . This was the worst iPhone I've ever bought . I couldn't even connect to MY wifi in the set up . Total waste of money ! The screen was shattered and I couldn't even get past the set up . Don't waste your time with this seller ! Just buy an iPhone 5s at Walmart on Straighttalk for $199 !"
"Apple",1,"I ordered the phone as a bday gift for my son. It got here on time but the battery in the phone was defective. The phone would die completely if the phone's battery reached half-life. I contact the company to get a battery. Living overseas it is not easy replacing a battery for this model and when I purchased it I thought I was purchasing a ""working"" iphone. That was four months ago with no response from the company. Last week the phone did one better, it stopped charging completely and the touch screen literally exploded from the inside out. Although this phone has been in a draw in a protective case for a month when my son was no longer grounded we gave it back to him the touch screen as completely disconnected itself from the phone while the body of the phone was still in the protective case. My son tried to press the screen back into the body of the phone and then the screen cracked. This was a waste of money and time he never got a full months use out of the thing, we were better off just buying him a cheap prepaid phone at least it would have worked."
"Apple",3,"ok i guess."
"Apple",1,"This was the product description 3.5"" display screen, the iPhone 3GS 16GB smartphone gives you a clear view of all the contents and applications. The Wi-Fi connectivity allows you to chat with friends, view your mails, and surf from almost anywhere. The 3.2MP camera lets you capture your favorite moments with amazing clarity. This iPhone features 600 MHz ARM Cortex A8 processor that lets you easily operate various applications at the same time. The 256MB RAM rapidly processes all your files and data.You cannot connect to wi-fi, you guessed it no Wi-Fi connectivity.The iphone did not come with cables, you guessed it, the customer did not said the item will be missing cables."
"Apple",1,"purchased this phone from Ross Cellular via Amazon last May. Has had problems for a couple of months now and is officially broken now. Do not recommend."
"Apple",3,"Very cool phone to have for collection"
"Apple",5,"Phone was in great condition. Works wonderfully. Great to have as a backup phone."
"Apple",2,"worked fine till I lost sound had to buy the bottom charging part for 6 bucks good again"
"Apple",1,"Don't like it period it took forever to get to me and when I did get it I don't like it it was all messed up when I put my sim in it it did not even register I took it ad throw it out"
"Apple",5,"Love this IPhone , although not the most modern model from apple compared to my old motorola phone I had before this phone is like going from day to night big big difference , is worth every dollar I pay , very very happy with this purchase ..I've heard some criticism here in some comments about the phone not being unlocked !! , no problem , at&t is doing it very easy for people who buy old models iphones to unlock any i phone for free !!! if you buy a new older models or used from business like amazon or you buy it from someone else at&t will , unlocked at no charge  I did unlock my purchase for free in the At&t web side if you Iphone is three year old and has no pending contract with at&t and has no history of being stolen or history prematurely canceled contracts from the original owner with at&t this in case you buy a used ) they will unlocked for free !!! ..."
"Apple",1,"I am very disappointed with this product. not because of physical appearance or whatever, but because of lack of arrival. It was supposed to get here by the 23rd of December, but I still haven't gotten it at the start of 2014. I wish I could give zero stars."
"Apple",5,"I bought this phone for my daughter, great phone even thought it's an older model, it's GREAT, service was also GREAT"
"Apple",1,"Worked good for one year it lasted and then it showed that what it means to buy a refurbished product! Isn't this what is always expected with refurbished products. Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice, shame on me."
"Apple",1,"Not at all as advertised. This was a gift for a friend and She didn't tell Me about the problems until I saw the phone in use out of the box. She didn't want to seem ungrateful. besides the damage to the phone there are some functionality issues. So to anyone out there... check the phone well. power it on.. don't just listen to Amazon if they say ""like new""!!!! No one checks these things out to see if they really work.. they just go on the disclosures of the last owner. If they don't check the phone( and this goes mostly for the 3rd party sellers) then they don't know of any issues... allowing them to sell the phone as ""like new"". Just lettin You know..."
"Apple",3,"Product was exactly as described. There were no dents. The housing reflected only light wear and tear and the screen itself was flawless. The quality of customer service fell a bit short of 100%. Otherwise, my rating would have another star. From now on, I will stick to purchasing all accessories from the Apple store."
"Apple",3,"Phone worked great! Only issue was that it wouldn't charge. Something was bent small repair made and it works like a charm"
"Apple",5,"This is a great product, it worth its price. The phone can do as much as all of the other iPhones out there."
"Apple",3,"Works well except for the battery which doesn't hold a charge well. Loses power much more quickly than other 3GS units I've owned. Shuts off with ~15% left. Yes, i calibrate the battery regularly. It doesnt help. Based on its shaky battery life and power quirks, I don't think this phone will be working much longer, so I feel a bit cheated."
"Apple",5,"IPhone 3gs is a solid smartphone. It is relatively light and compact. It has a premium feel and it is just beautiful. The battery lasts all day long on reasonably heavy used with screen brightness at 70-80 per cent. Call quality is solid and antenna reception is consistent."
"Apple",1,"The phone had pretty heavy scratches on the front and back, plus the back part was all cracked! The phone restarts itself all the time and the battery lasts 2 hous top! I bought it from Amazon Warehouse and definitely would NOT buy it again."
"Apple",1,"I look for an unlocked iphone and this was not. The article said iphone 3gs yet sent me an iphone 3g and I did not pay for it .... this is not right and it is wrong because it is a deception."
"Apple",5,"The product was exactly what I expected. Very Pleased. The phone came with all the original packaging and ""how to"" manual"
"Apple",1,"we had a lot of problems with this iphone from the beginingafter 3 weeks screen went blank could not use it, I sent it back to the vendor, hope i get my money back..."
"Apple",1,"Payed for the iphone on October 9th, October 30th was the latest to arrive from arizona to california and as of today (11-6) I'm still waiting.Of course I tracked it and long story short the product was delivered on 10-22 in Nigeria Africa ... What???!!!That's all I can say about the iPhone 3 I pay for a month ago, I'm hoping by the time it gets here it will be the iPhone 5 insteadBtw, Benjamin from amazon customer service has been great help, he's the positive part of this nightmare.Hopely my son gets compensated for all the frustration every day waiting for the postal service guy to show up bringing his phone."
"Apple",4,"I used it for a long time until my friend sold me his iPhone 4. Now my sister is using my old 3GS. She absolutely loves it. It came in perfect condition and was fast! I still wouldn't trade the 4 for the 3G but I loved the 3G non-the-less."
"Apple",5,"i wantto know if this phone is AT&T )) i want to bay it. please understand. thnx thnx thnx thnx thnx"
"Apple",3,"The phone arrived on time as indicated (That is good !). Phone screen is in good condition so far and the back cover has some scracthes. It is locked, but i have my AT&T SIM ready. As of now, the only thing that trouble me is the missing pin that use to open the SIM slot, the rest of the functions work just fine. I shall try to post more of this phone review, so stay tune."
"Apple",3,"Have had issues with ""no service"" several times, so far made 3 trips to AT and T.Replaced sim card and does not hold charge well. We keep hoping the issues will stop, still not sure if we will keep or return."
"Apple",1,"The phone appeared to be in good condition, but it is defective. It's difficult to hear. I thought it was the plastic over the phone but it wasn't & didn't realize it until a few weeks after i purchased the phone."
"Apple",1,"First off i put in my sim card and it wouldn't read it for like a whole night. it kept saying searching but wouldn't read it. When it finally read it the problem was it kept turning off randomly even though i was at 70% . Waste of $190"
"Apple",5,"Very happy with the two iPhones we bought!"
"Apple",5,"thnx"
"Apple",4,"very happy with my purchase, very good quality for that price."
"Apple",1,"When I got the phone it had no sound. When calling someone they could not hear me. The phone was also covered in gunk"
"Apple",5,"This item meet my expectation . very good item work properly .Thank you ."
"Apple",3,"The provider did not specify that the phone had damaged battery and casing rotates why I give this punctuation"
"Apple",1,"never worked. didn't ring, dropped numbers. I hated it but couldn't afford to change to a different smart phone. My husband finally convinced me to get a dumb phone and stop being so upset by a piece of junk"
"Apple",5,"commend good product"
"Apple",1,"Had water damage, got screwed!"
"Apple",5,"yes my costumer was so very satisfy to yhis unit"
"Apple",1,"Volume buttons dont work, sim card slot broken charging slot at times not functional, alot of freezing when phone is on and five cracks om the back"
"Apple",5,"I bought this phone as being unlocked. It wasn't. I called at&t and they registered my simms card and went to turn it on. Nothing! Why? It needs a simms card with unlocked pin? At&T didn't know what I was talking about? Nice phone to look at. So I'm going to try to take it to the corporate At&t store and then probably to Apple Store. I will give a better review after I drive a hour to these stores. Check out my new review. Didn't have to drive. grreat Phone! clear reception and voice. No problems. Yes I woould recommend this seller 100%"
"Apple",4,"I'm happy with this phone. I really like the speed delivery of this phone. Finally I have an iPhone I love love using this"
"Apple",5,"Wish we had purchased 2 of these instead of just one. It has plenty of room to download several movies and shows for the grandchildren."
"Apple",5,"Phone condition was like new every button works good also arrived in good time,as indicated,I would recommend buying this phone,at this price compared too!!!"
"Apple",2,"What I said in the beggining: It's brand new as described! I am now getting my unlock code from AT&T. Thank you guys for the lowest price iphone! I would highly recommend this seller and the product to my friends!After 3 months: The iphone still works, but it started to freeze randomly. Sometimes it shutsdown eventhough the battery is at 80 to 100%. It doesn't turn on, no matter what you do. Then somehow, it randomly turns on after 30 to 40 mins. Since I am a technician, I would say it is the case of refurbrished items. It is not the ""brand new"" item as listed. At my best guess, I would say these are the refurbrished items that are left over from carriers such as AT&T and verizon and later sold to third party sellers. CHEAP BUSINESS! I HIGHLY RECOMMEND NOT TO BUY THIS ITEM!!!"
"Apple",2,"We had to go get another batter for it and after battery installation, it never worked very well. Always needed to be plugged in."
"Apple",4,"I lost my 5G so I had to buy this one to replace it. It's almost as good!! I never used the Seri anyway."
"Apple",1,"The product that I received from this seller was non-functioning. I was promised a fully working iPhone 3GS 16g..however upon arrival I noticed immediately that the phone would not sync with iTunes. So I took it in to the Apple store, and they notified me that the internal antenna was broken.Complete waste of time and money. On top of that, I am still waiting for my refund."
"Apple",1,"Had to take it to an apple store to get it to work. They said it was so bad inside I should trade it in.So it cost me to get it fixed big time. It was sold as refurbished, had to be a bold face lie.It's a wonderful product but the seller grossley misrepresented it. Refurbished means it works right?"
"Apple",5,"Love it"
"Apple",5,"Was the best"
"Apple",1,"when i recieved the phone the sim card reader was not working and phone would not get passed activation setup screen"
"Apple",1,"The particular phone I got, Well it exploded after it's first Charge! I'm glad it wasn't on my son at the time. I believe he may have gotten hurt!"
"Apple",5,"good"
"Apple",1,"I don't like it because I need ios 7 upgrade and it wont let me upgrade to it so now I need to buy another new phone that will take the ios 7 upgrade"
"Apple",2,"I paid over $200 for a 16 gb phone and ended up getting an 8 gb."
"Apple",5,"It's beautiful,no real scratches,no cracks.But I may be sending it back,can't access Amazon account on it,or Facebook😱"
"Apple",5,"runs soooooooo smoth"

It was stating the phone was factory unlocked and I called in to make sure I was getting the product as advertise the customer service rep assured me I would received factory unlocked phones and it doesn't seems like no 3rd party people wanted to touch the phones to try and unlocked them."
"Apple",4,"I got the iPhone in less than 24 hours ,no original iPhone box was in it ,some scratches on back ,screen perfect iPhone locked to at&t."
"Apple",5,"My iPhone works like new. It looks better than the description. Phone was unlocked, and ready to use! I love it. & I got it for a great price!!! I recommend it."
"Apple",5,"Absolute Value for money and this is what I expected from Amazon !.I received in neat packaging with all necessary accessories required."
"Apple",3,"I Just received the product, but i am really unable to know if it is working. The SIM CARD TRAY is missing. I can not insert the SIM CARD.Amazon adressed the issue ok so far."
"Apple",5,"my first 3G came severely discounted with the initial 2yr plan. 8mths later it was stolen. i didnt realize i couldnt purchas another at the same 'discounted' price. it was $3-400 to replace it.i got the identical phone through amazone for $150. i've yet to tell any difference, other than i use my password lock and my ""find my phone"" app...after i was told by AT&T and apple they 'couldnt trace' my original phone without it (which i dont believe). but either way...i'm 'older', not the most techy person, and probably i dont use the phone to its fullest potential, yet. but it serves my purpose thus far, and i have no complaints, yet. seemingly as with most smart phones, its made to be dropped (very slick and sleek) so i HIGHLY suggest purchasing some sort of silicone wrap for ease of grip or some 'hard cover' to protect it from when you drop it. its not a matter of IF, but when. the first one i didnt drop AT ALL for 8mths. i dropped the 2nd one twice in one week...but thankfully it was protected."
"Apple",4,"works very well, for the most part, but its unlocked so it took a little effort to get picture messaging to work and after every 5-7 texts or every phone call, I have to turn it off and back on to get signal."
"Apple",5,"Bought this used locked GSM iPhone 3GS 16GB for two reasons:1. it's sold by trust-worthy Amazon WarehouseDeals2. it's advertised that product was ""From the Manufacturer""Received the phone in excellent shape, well packed, like new, with the latest 5.0 firmware. It came with a new set of genuine Apple earphones with remote and mic, dock connector to USB cable and USB power adapter. Touchscreen and battery seemed to be newly replaced as well!Googled around, selected a company on the internet that claimed to be the No. 1 iPhone unlock service provider; after payment to them, received from them a message claiming that ""software was being developed and would be available soon (without a commitment date when software will be available)"". Since then, I've never been able to get my money back through PayPal!Fortunately, there's a professional independent iPhone repair shop in town (not at&t, T-Mobile or Cincinnati Bell) who could help activate, jailbreak and unlock my phone; the phone works great now! I don't have to purchase a 2-year plan, I can use the best-deal package plan I want from either at&t, T-Mobile or Cincinnati Bell any time. One important note: NEVER update your firmware after the unlock, otherwise, everything will be reset to previous locked configuration!"
"Apple",3,"The phone is nice condition, almost looks new but it is not unlocked! I have not had any luck unlocking it yet, but remain hopeful!"
"Apple",1,"I bought this iphone and discovered that it is LOCKED to AT&TDon't BUY , I am returning it back to Amazon warehouse !!!"
"Apple",5,"Had to order twice, first time I received incorrect product, but customer service was GREAT and handled everything expeditiously....my son loves it!"
"Apple",3,"good afternoon I received the phone is locked does not recognize the card without my line is movistar sim trajeta says that is not compatible"
"Apple",4,"I am enjoying my new phone. I still have a lot to learn about it. Just bought a new cover for it."
"Apple",5,"they come in ok condition ! but for the price you can complain !! its actually better than good but not very good cosmetic !! always buy from amazon and not 3rd party sellers !"
"Apple",4,"I would have given it a higher rating, but I had to get a SIM card Holder installed on the Phone. Other than that the phone seems to be working fine. Phone is in very good condition and was well packaged."
"Apple",5,"I bought this phone used through the Amazon Warehouse Deals. I wasn't expecting much, but I figured that if anything was wrong, I could simply return it.The box arrived in a few days, and I'm not exaggerating when I say that this phone was just like new. It came in its original packaging, with all of the accessories and manuals, and there were no visible scratches. The only thing that let me know that the phone was used was that the port where the charger goes and the speakers had gotten a little dusty. So, in short, the phone arrived in like-new condition.As for the phone itself, it's worked fine for me so far. I've been using it for about two weeks now, and I haven't encountered any problems. The only complaints I have are about AT&T and their service, not the phone itself. It bears repeating that if you get this phone, it's not unlocked and you're stuck with AT&T. If you can make peace with that, and one is on offer from Warehouse Deals, I highly recommend getting this phone!"
"Apple",4,"I was real nervous about buying an iPhone that was refurbished on-line but I am glad I only paid $100 for this 3G it was a great buy."
"Apple",3,"The phone is in great condition. no scratches , no acting funny , just the cord charger that came with the phone wont charge it. The box works just not the cord. I'm not happy with the charger not working but overall its been good !"
"Apple",5,"Quality was as advertised. An unlock is required before you can use your own SIM. There were no significant scratches and the product was up to standards."
"Apple",5,"I bought that phone it looks real good. I went to a thrift store and found a case to carry it in. It was brand new too. The battery doesn't hold a charge for very long. How long are they suppose to hold a charge? I have not used it yet nor have I went to see if it was unlocked or not. So I am wondering if the battery is good or has to be replaced. This is my first smart phone so I am ""DUH"" on the usage. Oh on the PayPal issue I have been waiting almost a year to get money back from them and that money came from my bank account. I did not use PayPal for payment. So GOOD LUCK. I love Amazon they ROCK!!!!"
"Apple",3,"the iphone 3gs is okay. the battery does not last long. i have to constancely keep it charged. i did receive the phone in a timely manner and the condition was good."
"Apple",4,"Using for a digital music device in my car. Great idea and no complaints about the product itself. It works fine. However, the way the seller packaged it (with no wrapping between device and inside of envelope), I had to clean a lot of sticky adhesive from the envelope out of the headphone jack before I could use it."
"Apple",5,"Great quality product"
"Apple",5,"Came as described, Works perfectly & seller even gave a charger and ear buds so I'm happy with that and also I'm using the device already to leave this review :)"
"Apple",5,"I got this phone for my wife and she loves it."
"Apple",4,"No problems noted!"
"Apple",4,"I bought this phone for my daughter to enable me to keep in contact with a child who has recently moved out of the house but had lost her phone. She seems to be pleased with some of the newer features."
"Apple",4,"Great phone as stated, very fast shipping!"
"Apple",5,"Purchased from Wireless Warehouse, as a gift. It came exactly as described, arrived promptly and in good condition. Hard telling what exactly ""reconditioned"" consisted of, other than not in factory Jewel Box. Hoping a new battery?It came charged, fired right up and easily replaced an older dying 3GS. Time will tell, but so far so good."
"Apple",5,"This phone is in great condition! It looks like it is new!! Beyond what I expected!"
"Apple",5,"My daughter loves it. It is great."
"Apple",5,"Was exactly what I needed for my daughter :)"
"Apple",5,"good"
"Apple",4,"Got this iPhone for fifty bucks.Yes it's a very old edition, but it still works for the most part. It is a used model, but in good shape..especially the screen,which matters most. The battery life goes quite quick, like in 2 hours with moderate use, a bit more time if standby. I think the battery may need replacing in the near future.I bought a backup battery you plug in..so I am all right, most of e time.You can still get a lot of apps, just not most new ones, as it use iOS 6.?I use the Phone with a provider that is only $15 a month including 400mb of data.Overall I am happy..to have a iPhone. Next year I go up to a 4! I love old school!"
"Apple",5,"Great when I bought it. Use it as an iTouch now."
"Apple",5,"Good phone ..."
"Apple",5,"Excellent and fast shipping"
"Apple",5,"Great deal for the price. The phone has little if any wear and works perfectly."
"Apple",1,"Never really worked wouldn't charge"
"Apple",3,"outdated quickly"
"Apple",4,"The company is lightening quick with shipping and customer service.The only negative issue I've had with this phone is that the battery life is too short. Otherwise, the phone is wonderful and the browser speed is amazing. Great phone, lousy battery life. Not a bad deal at all."
"Apple",1,"Phone came with screen popped out, but still working, and a scratch on the back. A day later, the phone screen was completely popped out. Sending it back as soon as possible."
"Apple",1,"Everything about the purchase was good except the battery. The item was delievred quickly, it came with all the accesories and in good condition. However, there were big issues with the batter. The battery life of the phone was terrible, if I listened to music for a hour or so right after charging the phone I would have to recharge it immediatly....same with intensive texting....and somehimes battery said 50% and it would just shut off receiving a phone call....the cell phone shut off on me so many times that I had to keep it plugged in....which entirely defeats the purpose of having a phone! I would strongly suggest that before you buy a used cell phone you ask the seller about the battery. In the end I returned the phone and they were quick with the refund. I give them one star because everything was good, except the phone!!"
"Apple",3,"I guess for the price the condition wasnt THAT bad, but i was really hoping for better, few visible scratches on the screen and back, but other than cosmetics the phone works pretty well, bought it for my mom. if you just need a phone like this and could careless about the cosmetics then id recomend it (bought it from amazon warehouse or something) otherwise i'd invest in a better looking phone youd probably get a little more for your money. i paid 120 to 130 or something. Good over all, but wished for better."
"Apple",5,"This product is very good, and it is what I like to buy it, and it is a very good deal!"
"Apple",5,"aside from the usual wear and tear scratches, all works just fine, its awesome!! and it got here on time soooo goooddd!!!! thanks for being trustworthy...definitely buying with you in future"
"Apple",5,"The phone works great and arrived quickly. This is a used product and I'm very happy with it. No problems."
"Apple",2,"Though the phone came packaged in a box and bubble wrapping, the upkeep of the phone was worn and scratched up.All of the open sockets had dirt in them.I was disappointed with the purchase."
"Apple",5,"We got this for our 15 year old for Christmas--his first phone. He's as happy as a clam and so are we. My only complaint against the iPhone is that the battery can't be replaced by ordinary humans. But it does good stuff and it always works."
"Apple",4,"my iphone is working good but the power button is acting up but everything else is working right thank you for the iphone"
"Apple",5,"the iphone was as described it was excellent i`m trying to unlock it`s off contract AT&T , really good iphonethis seller is really good and fast service"
"Apple",5,"I finally decided to get a smart phone and this iPhone 3GS is perfect for me. Has more features than those on the 3 and almost as much as the 4.For a retired person like myself, it is perfect. The iPhone 3GS was brand new and unlocked as stated. I set it up on Consumer Cellular phone and data service and I will be using it in Europe with a European SIM card for phone, # and data there.It works perfectly. Loved it so much we bought another for my spouse!NO DISAPPOINTMENT OR DISSATISFACTION HERE!VERY PLEASED!"
"Apple",1,"producto no se recibio su empaque ni con sus accesorios originales, adicional se recibio con la tarjeta logica dañada la pantalla se queda en blanco, tengo un pisapapelesProduct not received your package or with their original accessories, additional logic card received with damaged screen goes blank, I have a paperweight"
"Apple",1,"wharehouse deals POSDON'T BUYTOTAL JUNKdoesn't hold a charge for more than twenty minutesfront screen unresponsivetotal POS"
"Apple",5,"come early than expected and i got a new product, do not know its a used one and i need to buy 2 more"
"Apple",5,"I needed to replace my iPhone 3GS since it wouldn't recognize the charger & my computer wouldn't recognize the phone when plugged into it for downloads. This phone is bettter than the one I got from AT&T!!!"
"Apple",5,"I love it and the price is very good for the iPhone I recomend any body who intrest on it purchase the out any doubt.Manny Depina"
"Apple",4,"The only thing I wish is that AT&T & Apple would work out a data service, because I cannot use my unlimited data on my new iPhone."
"Apple",4,"Overall, I changed my mind. While the phone wasn't as described, it's not bad at all. I do still have to clean it up a bit from the adhesive, but it's not a big deal, especially for such a low price. Customer service was excellent. The problem was resolved with a partial refund for it's condition, and I'm happy with that."
"Apple",1,"First of all it wasnt match what its says on website. It was internally broken phone and it wasnt unlock."
"Apple",3,"good afternoon I received the phone is locked does not recognize the card without my line is movistar sim trajeta says that is not compatible"
"Apple",2,"The cell works well, however for some reason the charging is a problem. I have to charge while cell is off and it doesn't always work. I have to turn cell off and on several times before it will actually charge. I don't recommend this cell, their are so many more better cells than this one. Keep shopping."
"Apple",5,"love the phone. I can hear others clear as a bell. Just received my phone this week. The music is you can find is great."
"Apple",4,"I've had factory refurbished items before and they did not come with the light scuffs and scratches on the screen (not enough to notice during use, but light scuffs all the same), and the apple ID and password alert continues to pop up with unfamiliar usernames. Other than that and a few light start up bumps, the phone works as good as new. Came with wall charger and cable. Delivered a day early. Would recommend to a friend."
"Apple",3,"I'm happy with the product you received, thank you very much."
"Apple",1,"First of all the phone was not an iPhone 3GS , it is an iphone 3G instead.#2 I could not activate it for some reason by connecting it with iTunes , I've tried dozens of time unsuccessfullyDon't trust this buyer , all they care about is getting customers money"
"Apple",4,"This has been my first i phone so it was a big step up from my last. Highly responsive, bright display, great to store music, finally I'm texting (!)- it's all good. Now that I've had it a bit and I watch my kid facetime on her ipod 4 (which this can't do due to no front facing camera) I realize an i phone 4 probably wouldn't have cost any more or much more. However, it's easy to put a non-contract month to month or pay as you go service on the 3GS, which is why we got it. You might be able to do this on an i phone 4, but the newer the i phones get the trickier the tech' gets to keep you from doing that. Worth 100 bucks for sure."
"Apple",1,"not good as new."
"Apple",5,"ives effective service. works as expected and promptly. good for those in love with iPhone . recommended to all give it a trial"
"Apple",1,"I had an iPhone 3 and I loved it. I've been purchased an iPhone 3 of this website, the battery would not hold its charge it would be at 80 percent and my phone would shut off. this happened every day I charge it every night and I don't think that 80 percent your phone should shut off... and also everytime I try to use the camera the phone would shut off....extremely frustrating I do not recommend this site for phones."
"Apple",1,"Horrible reception. Poor GPS connectivity. Poor GPS accuracy. Constantly loses signal even when outside in a good coverage are. Overall poor phone quality. Although apps work great and makes for a great iPod."
"Apple",5,"Good"
"Apple",5,"This iPhone is for my colection of iPhones I started and I could not be more pleased. The Iphone3GS was refurbushed, had no problem getting it unlocked by AT&T. The phone does not have a single scratch on it, it looks brand new. Very pleased."
"Apple",5,"Niceee"
"Apple",1,"the description was NEW but when we got it, it didn't hold service so I took it to AT&T and the APPLE store and the pulled the serial # and saw the phone was purchased 5 years ago."
"Apple",5,"Great"
"Apple",1,"The phone would not get service. I purchased 3 phone s on amazon. Only one was not hacked. I will not buy another phone on amazon."
"Apple",1,"Very bad"
"Apple",1,"This phone is a real disappointment. I can not get onto the internet unless I am at an establishment that has WIFI. So this phone is useless to me. Now I have to buy another phone that is in working condition this is the first time I have ever had a problem buying a phone on Amazon."
"Apple",5,"very good"
"Apple",3,"I am having problems with the charger hookup. Is difficult to hook the charger"
"Apple",4,"it gives you an iPhone experience"
"Apple",5,"My wife uses this phone now. Works great,"
"Apple",1,"I ordered this phone for my husband and it would not work in the mountains in southeastern Oklahoma where we live and I still have it can I send it back with case and glass jprotectors"
"Apple",1,"New update- I should have just returned this piece of crap. It no longer functions unless it is plugged in. It turns off constantly from something as simple as I am typing a text and receive a text at the same time. not pictures, just text, and the phone is not loaded up with anything, I don't have games or videos. It is simply a garbage phone. I did not heed the waning signs, I really wanted it to work, but alas, it doesn't.Update - I did not get a chance to change back over to my old cracked phone, but in the meantime I left the new one on a charger for a whole day and now it seems to be working fine. Perhaps they should include an instruction to do this before using the phone (although, I have never had another phone glitch out like that and not want to charge or take a full day to complete one full charge, so it still makes me think twice about keeping it)... For now I am updating my review to 3 stars and keeping the phone because I just don't have the energy to go through another 3rd party seller return. Hopefully I don't regret it...Just received this phone and in the last 24 hours it doesn't seem to get to full charge no matter how long it is plugged in. It has also turned off randomly at least 25 times during use and you turn it back on and it turns off a few more times before staying on for a couple hours, but as soon as it is being used to do anything it glitches and turns off within a few minutes. All I've done is text on it and read a few online articles, I don't even have apps or a ton of stored things, so no reason to glitch like this."
"Apple",5,"perfect"
"Apple",5,"very good"
"Apple",1,"no work, i do not recomend this item and the seller."
"Apple",3,"bien"
"Apple",2,"Wouldn't let me upgrade to the newest software for Iphones."
"Apple",1,"Unusable"
"Apple",1,"The phone does not hold a charge at all.I cant take it off the charger or it will die even when it says 100%"
"Apple",5,"So it's not the newest phone out there, so what. This phone was cheaper than getting an iPod of same GB size. It's an apple product so good support, good apps."
"Apple",5,"This classic iPhone has the old school shape and weight, with plenty of performance. I'm one for simplicity and the classic 3GS is a solid buy."
"Apple",5,"It performs great. I would recommend it to anyone that wants an iphone, but can't afford the latest one out there."
"Apple",1,"Product in good condition but incomplete, because i miss miss accessories had the doubt if so go on and buy it had bought a better one because i had to make additional spending"
"Apple",4,"got just like they said and im happy with it however it was missing the on/off switch cover and I had to have that repaired but my otter box cover is the only thing that keeps it in place- phone looks and works fine but I was a tad disappointed with the missing part"
"Apple",5,"I bought this phone for my son & he loves it especially it's being his first iPhone. Great product at a great price. Item arrived at the time it said it would"
"Apple",1,"On the description for the iphone It said it didnt work but could be fixed but it wasnt coming on and you didnt drop it or do anything to it! but i took it to the shop to be fixed and they said that it had water damage to it and could not be fixed! :-("
"Apple",4,"Both the phones where in nearly new condition. However few days latter battery of one of the phone become like balloon and braking most of the internal parts. the front glass came out etc.."
"Apple",1,"I was fooled by the item description. It was totally below expectations. I could not even use the phone. Seems that they were just trying to place a broken phone to innocent buyers..."
"Apple",5,"I'm happy with the purchase came one month here in Brazil however, I did not realized that the device is locked, so I can not insert my sim card here in Brazil, but I'll try to unlock, and if anyone knows how to unlock for use in Brazil by please help me thank you"
"Apple",2,"I am very disappointed as I ordered an Apple iPhone 3GS 16GB (Black) however received a 3g with model number A1241. All the packaging said that it was a 3gs however the phone itself is a 3g. This is made worse as I am living and working In Africa and had a friend bring it over when he visited."
"Apple",4,"Only after one month the IPhone would no longer charge properly. I have to reset the phone every time I need to charge it. And the charge cord lasted half as long before it fell apart. Over all I love the phone and it was like new when it came in. Highly satisfied."
"Apple",3,"Label on the box included the correct description, Iphone 3gs 16 gb black, however the phone included was a 3g 8gb black in good conditions.Price was good an item was in good condition, included usb cable, wall charger and earphones.Phone was not unlocked."
"Apple",5,"I am happy with this purchase. It was delivered on time. Though it was a used phone, it looked like brand new, wrapped in a plastic, screen in mint condition and hardly any scratches on the back cover. Included were a new wall charger, new usb cable and new headphone. It is functionally perfect, good network, holds battery for just over a day. Overall, a nice buy for the price."
"Apple",1,"horrible. it doesn't even work. no charger and little description about what is in the box of my package. the user only took a picture on the back instead of the screen. i knew something was fishy. don't even know how to return it to get my money back!!!"
"Apple",5,"My phones category was unlocked phones"", but when I received it was locked and it had the second problem too: when I tried to charge phone, on the screen displayed: charging is not supported with this accessory"". With my friends original cable it charged fine. I repaired my phone at the apple dealer and paid $30. Amazon has refund my money and I am very satisfied of its service."
"Apple",5,"Awesome phone. It was neat and doesnt look like used. Easy to acivate and use. Never had issues with it till date. Highly recommended."
"Apple",5,"i wish i had done this 2 yr back ,brand new phone ,stoned noke e5 ,samsung galaxy ( worse phone ) android sucks .every money tight should buy this phone .sound quality is not good as nokia and certain features are missing as comparison to new 4s siri dont works on it ,screen touch is little slow to fluid flow ,so buy a otter box case from amazon its dirt cheap too .so finally very glad i have finally what i wanted .loving it and it will go a long way with me until new iphone 5 came out ."
"Apple",1,"This phone is locked, and thats really a bad way to do business by displaying another label.I cannot afford to come back to US to send it back but I think this would serve as a reminder"
"Apple",4,"The iphone 3GS works perfectly with one exception. I purchased this product in ""like new"" condition. There were no scratches or blemishes at all. All the programming works great. My one complaint is the menu button at the bottom. It does not 'click' crisp at all. When you press it it feels like there is something jammed in it below the surface. It's not bad enough to return, but does not earn 5 stars either."
"Apple",5,"Opened box, charged battery, upgraded to the latest software, off and running. It was the perfect gift to someone who had never had a smart phone before. These 3gs feel great in the hand vs the boxy 4s & 5. Bayshine trading inc. was prompt in delivering and then re-delivering when my sister who was surprised to receive it returned by mistake. Una Stewart"
"Apple",2,"The accessories did not work (hand free, the charger), I ought to replace new items. I am angry about that."
"Apple",5,"love the seller for selling it so cheap bets thing about it it was factory unlocked but what really special what that it had the old bootrom which meant i could have a untethered jailbreak on ios 6.0.1 came with everything except the cables and charger."
"Apple",4,"it is great looks brand new but it freezes sometimes and wont charge but that is to be expected.. great!"
"Apple",5,"Exactly as I expected! No surprises and works/functions like an excellent minimally used mac-buttons cheaper than a new one!"
"Apple",3,"It's a bit slow for what it is, nowadays, and most software only barely gets to it. It's somewhat slow, but still fairly powerful. However, be sure that you're getting a factory unlocked phone. Several sellers are selling them as simply iphones, but if you try using a different sim card, it won't work, or it was hacked to allow this. So be sure of what you're getting!"
"Apple",2,"i purchased this phone trusting that it is really unlocked. Apparently Amazon doesn't really check these things. I am outside the country now and cant make any calls as i keep getting invalid sim message. And then to make it worse,its a dead battery.Only a red battery line shows on the screen and this makes the phone trip off after 2 minutes. I'm so sad"
"Apple",2,"I received this phone a few weeks ago and it has not been good. First when i get it out of the box the ringer/mute switch doesn't work, when the seller claimed it did. Then i find that the phone dies at 50% battery. The seller said they had no problems and it worked great. Well, mine doesn't sound like a very functional phone. I was indifferent about the broken mute/ringer switch, but then to only be able to use it for only 50% battery, is just really unusable as a phone, or even an iPod for that matter. Be careful and ask a lot of questions! Make sure you buy from a trusted seller."
"Apple",2,"The iPhone was put on the website in very good condition,butIt was in terrible internally I had to get a new battery and theBattery got so stretched out it bent the motherboard so it shuts on and off randomlyAlso the back of it is melted ffrom the battery and now it doesn't work at all aand he didn't offer to pay the 75 dollarsWorth of work I had put into it or half a refund would be nice"
"Apple",3,"Perfect for my husband. He calls and texts and this fits the bill."
"Apple",3,"The company gave me a refund without any problems. Exceptional service.The phone is worse than worthless.I used to think apple products were better because I never owned any of them.I wanted to find out if iPhones were really as good as people say they are.I've been a programmer, technician, electronic engineer, satellite communications specialist, phone network specialist, and datacenter network management specialist, before I retired in 2001, and I figured out how to do everything I want with android phones easily when I got my first one in 2010.I couldn't do anything with this.First I had to drive all over the city to find a sim card because it won't even let you use it on wifi without one and it took hours of trying different places because apple changes stuff like that with every new model just so their customers can't keep using their old accessories when they buy a new phone.When I got into it I couldn't get it to do anything.It was perfectly functional but it wouldn't do anything I wanted to do. Even the simplest things I do easily on every windows android or Linux device I've ever used.Of course every Microsoft OS has been extremely badly designed and Android sucks in its own ways, and haven't used Linux enough to have an opinion about it.But ios is the worst I've ever seen.With that and the nonremovable battery which will stop working in about a year and hardly any storage, I wouldn't use this phone they paid me."
"Apple",1,"It said in the description stating that it was in great condition with only a few minor scratches. I understood that and was fine with that. But, what I also got was a battery that is expanding so much that its cracking the phone. The battery is so expanded that it wont keep a charge or even stay powered on. Cant even use the phone"
"Apple",5,"Purchased for my niece. She loves the iphone."
"Apple",5,"Exactly as Described. Used for a few months and then Resold for cost price"
"Apple",2,"Phone can in good/great condition however u can't use it without a SIM card. I brought it for my son for music n couldn't use it with get caught up in some contact with my carrier. Kinda a waste of money"
"Apple",5,"fast shipping and exactly what was stated in the description"
"Apple",1,"Camera doesn't work."
"Apple",5,"Everything that I expected...Thanks Fast Shipping as well..."
"Apple",4,"All went well Thanks"
"Apple",5,"The used Apple iPhone 3GS I ordered from Amazon Warehouse is incredible -- just like new! And it is so far superior to the Motorola Atrix I had. Touch works perfectly -- no accidental strokes, no opening something by mistake. Synced with all my info on computer quickly, so now have ALL contact info including ALL phone #s (not just mobile), addresses, & emails. Also calendar info and notes. I have ATT contract, so just inserted SIM and it was up and running. Shipping was fast. Very pleased with purchase."
"Apple",2,"The product did not say that was not unlock, and I am very upset since I have to travel international and do not have more time."
"Apple",4,"The 3G is really, really slow. I didn't want to sign a contract, but I needed a new phone. Perhaps the 3GS is slow compared with the 4 and 4s, but it's plenty fast for everything I need it to do, and being able to pick it up for the price Amazon Warehouse Deals offers it for and not having to sign a contract made this an excellent purchase. My only complaint is that the silence switch is a little wonky, but it is a minor complaint, given that the unit shipped with an immaculate back and screen, and with a sync cable, earbuds, and a wall charger. Highly recommended for those wanting to upgrade from the aging 3G but are wary of signing a new contract with AT&T."
"Apple",5,"I ordered this phone because my old LG prime's touchscreen was starting to become unresponsive. So, I thought why not try out the iphone 3gs, I'd heard good things about it, so I thought I would buy one. I choose to buy it online because everybody knows at&t's prices are ridiculous. So I bought the phone expecting not to get much for only $270. Boy, was I wrong. I got the phone in a nicely wrapped package and they even included a charger. Unfortunately, the phone was locked. But that was not a big problem, I took it to my nearest at&t store and got my number transfered to a new sim card for the phone. All in all I am very happy with my purchase. The phone only had a small scuff mark on the back and the battery is in marvelous condition."
"Apple",5,"This review is not for the product as you may find it everywhere in the www world. This is for the quality of the product that I received from the seller - Amazon Warehouse deals. I bought it used - like new condition. Luckily it came with a version of firmware that is easily unlockable (as I needed a phone to use it overseas). The quality was very good, battery holds well, screen was pristine and there were very minor scuffs and scratches on the back (which should be expected on a used piece). The sockets and ports were well cleaned up and came with NEW headphone, power adaptor and cable !! Highly recommend Amazon warehouse seller for this product."
"Apple",4,"The product was in good structure. I'm still not use it because in Brazil there is to unlock the current version of software."
"Apple",1,"The iPhone was fine. It works and is in good condition but one major thing was wrong with this product!!It was categorized under 'unlocked phones' but when I received it, it was clear that it was LOCKED! I had so much trouble with this phone and to sell a product that is different from the description on such a crucial feature is very very WRONG!"
"Apple",5,"Yes, the used iPhone 3GS works the way it should. I actually received two for the price of one. Also, both iPhones works with any SIM card that I putted."
"Apple",1,"bid for the purchase of an iphone 3gs 16gb, and they sent me was a iphone 3g 16gb with case broken in one corner and locked when the advert says this factory unlocked and it is a 3gs"
"Apple",5,"I'm a senior citizen and have been puzzled by many of the newer phones so I started out slow with the I-phone 3G. I knew right away I should have gone all the way and purchased the newest one. It has been so easy to learn. I recommend it to anyone"
"Apple",4,"works amazing, sooo fast and love IOS7 , its super fast and i love SIRI being on it with the new update."
"Apple",1,"I wouldn't even give it one star. I got this phone for my mother. She loved it but it wouldn't charge so had to send it back!"
"Apple",5,"Item was as described. Like new in the original box and packaging, with plastic protective sheet across screen, immaculate, with headphones and all papers and manual. It works just like my original 3GS (which served me for 5 years). Fantastic!"
"Apple",5,"Pros and consI will start with the cons: I forgot that the 3GS did not have siri. That was my fault, and because its an older model. and is on the newest firmware; the battery life is not all that great. 7 hours of use before it dies.Other reviews state that this company is shipping 3G phones instead of 3Gs.At first i thought the same thing until I called my carrear, and gave them the model number. They confirmed it was 3GS.Pros.Item arrived extremly quickly :-)As advertised it was brand new in box un-opened. :-)With moderate use, without the use of GPS, or downloading apps. Canging settings from 3G to 2G noticably increases the battery life.Over all i am extremly happy with my purchase."
"Apple",3,"Currently it is 2014, the 3gs is discontinued. However most of the apps I want are still working for it. Other reviews were full of lists that didnt work, but I tried them on the 3gs I got recently and the ones that didnt work were usually ones I didnt expect to work. Youtube,bbc News, Google Maps, GPS apps, Amazon Prime video, kindle books. All of these apps worked fine with no errors. As well as Final Fantasy Dimensions. I would expect most games not to work in this, but the only ones I've tried are FFD and Bejeweled which work fine. As for the phone itself, the screen is small and its sometimes not very reactive."
"Apple",2,"This phone was a replacement used by my daughter.When received she told me the phone wouldn't take andkeep a charge. I was told to put the phone on Airplane modeto charge. It never made a difference."
"Apple",1,"I ordered the 16GB model, but was sent the 8GB model instead. I contacted them via amazon, but haven't heard back from them since.If I wanted the 8GB model, I would have saved a lot of money and ordered it originally."
"Apple",2,"Screen cracked really quick."
"Apple",1,"Will never buy anything again. I received it and did not work. Neither one of them. Then returned them both and they received it. Never got my refund of 89.00 back, like they said it would happen."
"Apple",5,"When I saw that I could buy an apple phone for $35 I thought YAHOO! I have had a series of cheap'/free phones and an apple phone would be the ultimate. Before the phone arrived, I bragged to anyone who would listen. Everyone snickered about it This is a generation 3 phone which basically means it has older technology. I received the phone in less than a week.. It is thicker and the charger is different. The camera is not sophisticated, but it does take pics. No fancy ring tones, but calls are clear. There are limits with this phone, but none that bother me. I am very pleased with this phone."
"Apple",1,"Phone worked but it was scratched pretty bad and it was semi open like if it was dropped bad."
"Apple",2,"i got the phone and it's missing the tray to insert a sim card... it's useless the plus side it looks like it used to belong to a woman and she had ""nice"" pictures"
"Apple",2,"Poor reception"
"Apple",5,"This is a great iPhone for me to use since it is my first iPhone"
"Apple",5,"Great condition, reasonable price and will be buying from them again for my audiobook listening for my classroom! Very impressed!"
"Apple",5,"The phone was better than expected!"
"Apple",5,"Works great"
"Apple",5,"The iPhone 3GS 16gb I bought arrived in good condition and the phone look brand new. This is the trustworthy every person should have when buying a product got my product from ctphone. Gladly to do business and everyone should too. Great value and prices too. Excellent job.-Ashley"
"Apple",5,"Perfect for beginner iPhone user..Thank you very much."
"Apple",5,"Thanks"
"Apple",1,"This phone broke within a week. Not a great item. The whole screen just cracked because when I received it in the mail and when I opened it, it had a small crack onto it cause it wasn't packaged the right way"
"Apple",5,"EXCELENTE"
"Apple",5,"Works great!!"
"Apple",5,"fine"
"Apple",4,"It's pretty good for a old cell."
"Apple",5,"No problems. Phone look'd brand new!"
"Apple",5,"Amazing and fast...Thank you!!!!!"
"Apple",5,"iphone was in a vary good condition. there vere no scratches. everything was included as it was discribed. i'm very setisfied with my purchase."
"Apple",1,"Phone did not work it was junk could not get money back called and complained they would not do anything about it"
"Apple",3,"good service, fast delivery. I didn't arrange appearance of iphone 3gs received by me, namely attritions, scratches, chips and cracks. In the description them it wasn't mentioned"
"Apple",2,"In short I end up spending $92.00 in fixing this specious deal, i will never make such a mistake of buying USED electronics from you again"
"Apple",2,"The thing that saved it was the company at least sent instructions on how to fix the screen. Stinks because it was a gift :("
"Apple",1,"good afternoon, teams are locked and the aspect that is depressing arrived .. there is one that is estillado everything back sulphate is apparently the battery. quisera know we can do about it."
"Apple",3,"when i order this item it says 32gb but when the item is ship it change to 16 gb but the price didn't change..... misleading customers.."
"Apple",1,"I brought as NEW and UNLOCKED for Christmas gift for my mom. It lasts not even a month. Completed OFF! We lost great memories of my newborn baby . I just came from one local apple store and they said that the phone is NOT UNLOCKED AND IT IS NOT NEW either. It cannot be fix because is missing some pieces. - I am very disappoited and sad."
"Apple",1,"HI THE IPHONE WAS BROKEN FROM THE BACK NEAR TO THE CHARGE CONTACT ABOUT 1.5 in . IM SO SAD ABOUT THESE BECAUSE I WASN'T LIKE DESCRIBED AT ALL ."
"Apple",5,"I love the product, arrived on time and not have any damage, I am pleased with the product . OK"
"Apple",4,"I like my Apple iPhone . This make me able to contact my friends in easy and fast way. The thing that I do not like is the sound of coming call that I barely hear the other side even I put the sound on high level. In addition, this cellphone has clear screen and all icons are under my touch. I showed this Apple iPhone to all my friends and they asked me from where I got it. They surprised that how much I saved because I bought it from Amazon.com, Thanks Amazon.com"
"Apple",1,"The phone never even showed up.The online tracking said that it was supposed to arrive on the 19th, approximately a week or so after I first ordered it.The phone was a gift, so when it never arrived I was forced to go out and buy one myself (which was thankfully about 75% cheaper than this product).Luckily, the company was very apologetic and refunded my money after I reported the package to them.WARNING!!! The manufacturer themselves admitted that it was not the first time the packages had been shipped and suddenly vanished. They said they'd had this issue on multiple occasions. Save your time and money."
"Apple",4,"I like this phone. It cable a week later, but it works well. It was classified as new, but if came with scratches on the back. Very few, though."
"Apple",5,"The phone is In like new condition, better than expected. Very nice case ear phones charger and data cable included."
"Apple",5,"Love apple iphones, I've had 3. bought this one as a gift to bring my parents into the technology era."
"Apple",3,"phone works just fine, just don't drop it from any, and i mean any, height without a protective cover on it first. Dropped mine from 1 foot on to tile and the case cracked apart at the front and back seam."
"Apple",4,"I was so excited to get this phone although right away I had to have it repaired which was $50.00. I did not even have a clue that it would need to be unblocked until I purchased the right stuff to activate the phone and could not use it. So I am very disappointed that I have to spend more money to get it unblocked so in the long run I can only use it now to play games. I will not be buying any other phone at all from Amazon and I have purchased alot of things from this website."
"Apple",5,"These phones looked like they were brand new. My granddaughters loved them. Thanks! Plus they came with new chargers and USB connectors."
"Apple",5,"I didnt want to spend hundreds of dollars on an IOS device for my 13 year old. This iPhone does everything the latest touch will do-almost. If she is responsible enough and can take care of this, then we will move up."
"Apple",2,"its automatically turns off . i tried to charge but its still doing. every day its turning automatially and does not turns on.. i wait that 15 minut.. :("
"Apple",2,"Unfortunately, this did not turn out to be as good as originally thought.We discovered the phone would not hold a charge beyond a couple of hours, no matter usage time. Apparently the battery was bad, and we didn't want to invest the cost, which we understand is substantial, for having it replaced. Thank goodness for Amazon's excellent return policy."
"Apple",5,"I bought this phone for my daughter's birthday and she loves it! She had it activated within 5 minutes after I gave it to her and it's working great!"
"Apple",3,"Its a very good phone. The applications that comes in it are great. It help me to get organized: the clock with the convinience to set different alarms, the calendar for the appointments, the camera and the application to write notes. Those are my favorites. Another favorite is the ease to download applications like the Bible (daily devotional) and the calorie counter and GPS.My only disappointment was that it came with a crack in the back side of the phone (about an inch of long!). Its not noticeable since I use it with a cover.Otherwise I would have rated it with 5 stars.By the way I was wondering if it would work in Puerto Rico with Net 10 phone service... yes it does!"
"Apple",5,"This phone was in excellent condition and it was shipped fast. It was the best deal we could find on the older 3G model and I needed one fast because mine bit the dust."
"Apple",4,"I bought this phone for my son as a tester to see how he would do with an ""expensive"" phone. It was cheap and worked just fine. It is obviously slower than the newer iPhones, but I wasn't ready to purchase one of those for my son just yet."
"Apple",1,"The phone cuts off at65 percent, the camera doesn't work. I'm very disappointed in the phone. It's supposed to be a phone in good condition, it's not!"
"Apple",1,"Hello this message is for reporting touting an Iphone like new , and received iphone with detached screen, the screen has a line of liquid in the center and on top of that the device turns off after 30 minutes of use and you have to have it connected to the charger it will not fade._________________________Buenos días, el presente mensaje es para informar que promocionaban un Iphone como nuevo y me llegó un iphone con la pantalla despegada, la pantalla tiene una raya de líquido en el centro y aparte de eso el dispositivo se apaga luego de 30 minutos de uso y hay que tenerlo conectado al cargador para que no se apague."
"Apple",3,"Works nice. All the buttons work good. I love the side switch where I can just lock it and it turns the volume off instead of going into the settings and taking longer. However it does shut off when there is still half battery life left. And sometimes when I am in the middle of an app/game it shuts off as well. But other then that its nice because its a working phone"
"Apple",1,". The phone didnt work. Kept shutting off while in apps. It wouldn't turn back on unless hooked up to the charger. Sent it back this morning."
"Apple",4,"Seems to be as described and in great condition! Arrived on time But without promised case and the sync cord was super cheap but I didn't really buy it for that purpose. The phone is very good and that is certainly what counts!"
"Apple",5,"This was a gift to my son and he has loved it from the moment he received it. He's currently taking college classes in Cincinnati and it allows him to stay in touch with family and friends.My son loves Apple products and enjoys listening to downloaded music on his new Apple iPhone 3GS and the 16 GB gives him enought space to keep a nice library of music.I would recommand Amazon to everyone that is looking for a replacement or new smart phone"
"Apple",1,"Ordered unlocked, it's locked by a French carrier and it has a water spot under the screen! Can't believe I fell for this! Don't do it!"
"Apple",1,"product was blocked, the serial number of the box does not match with serial number of thephone, the ear-phone was not original. The product was manufactured in 2010.The product was returned and already refunded"
"Apple",4,"Very good phone. 16GB a big plus. Would have given a 5-star rating if it wasn't for the slight slow down when running iOS6"
"Apple",5,"It's exactly what we expected. Works great and was in the condition it was supposed to be in according to the ad. This item was part of a customer service adjustment from Amazon due to an earlier order problem."
"Apple",2,"This product is disappointing. It is locked and has a big crack at the back. The OS is also ancient."
"Apple",1,"Hello. I order you white phone. But you sent me black one. Can you tell me what happend. if u dont help me I will hate you.........I,m waiting your answer.sisinserly levani............."
"Apple",1,"Totally Bummed....Was a Christmas present for my son and the letter 'E' doesn't work. It now sits in the drawer..Useless!"
"Apple",2,"I bought this phone specially because it was described as UNLOCKED. When I received my phone everything was ok until I put the SIM card, phone didn't work and I had to pay initially US15 to unlock the phone, next day when I tried to download applications I couldn't because the phone was not updated to ISO 4.3 or plus. Then I had to pay US$25 to update the phone to IOS 6.0 and unlock the phone for ever. I contacted the seller and he replied saying how he could help I told him to refund the initial $15 dollars I spent he replied just saying he didn't know how to refund the money and never replied to any of my following emails. In fact the phone was in really good condition but locked I had to pay totally $154 + $40 to repair. No happy with the shopping and the seller"
"Apple",5,"The phone came in its original box together with all its accessories: no scratches or dents. The phone looks as though it were brand new. It was on IOS 5 and the baseband was an unlockable one. I eventually managed to get an unlocked baseband on 6.0.1 without much trouble. Great purchase!"
"Apple",5,"Love it"
"Apple",5,"Was the best"
"Apple",1,"when i recieved the phone the sim card reader was not working and phone would not get passed activation setup screen"
"Apple",1,"The particular phone I got, Well it exploded after it's first Charge! I'm glad it wasn't on my son at the time. I believe he may have gotten hurt!"
"Apple",5,"good"
"Apple",1,"I don't like it because I need ios 7 upgrade and it wont let me upgrade to it so now I need to buy another new phone that will take the ios 7 upgrade"
"Apple",2,"I paid over $200 for a 16 gb phone and ended up getting an 8 gb."
"Apple",5,"It's beautiful,no real scratches,no cracks.But I may be sending it back,can't access Amazon account on it,or Facebook😱"
"Apple",5,"runs soooooooo smoth"
"Apple",1,"False advertising . It was stating the phone was factory unlocked and I called in to make sure I was getting the product as advertise the customer service rep assured me I would received factory unlocked phones and it doesn't seems like no 3rd party people wanted to touch the phones to try and unlocked them."
"Apple",1,"I am very disappointed with this product. not because of physical appearance or whatever, but because of lack of arrival. It was supposed to get here by the 23rd of December, but I still haven't gotten it at the start of 2014. I wish I could give zero stars."
"Apple",5,"I bought this phone for my daughter, great phone even thought it's an older model, it's GREAT, service was also GREAT"
"Apple",1,"Worked good for one year it lasted and then it showed that what it means to buy a refurbished product! Isn't this what is always expected with refurbished products. Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice, shame on me."
"Apple",1,"Not at all as advertised. This was a gift for a friend and She didn't tell Me about the problems until I saw the phone in use out of the box. She didn't want to seem ungrateful. besides the damage to the phone there are some functionality issues. So to anyone out there... check the phone well. power it on.. don't just listen to Amazon if they say ""like new""!!!! No one checks these things out to see if they really work.. they just go on the disclosures of the last owner. If they don't check the phone( and this goes mostly for the 3rd party sellers) then they don't know of any issues... allowing them to sell the phone as ""like new"". Just lettin You know..."
"Apple",3,"Product was exactly as described. There were no dents. The housing reflected only light wear and tear and the screen itself was flawless. The quality of customer service fell a bit short of 100%. Otherwise, my rating would have another star. From now on, I will stick to purchasing all accessories from the Apple store."
"Apple",3,"Phone worked great! Only issue was that it wouldn't charge. Something was bent small repair made and it works like a charm"
"Apple",5,"This is a great product, it worth its price. The phone can do as much as all of the other iPhones out there."
"Apple",3,"Works well except for the battery which doesn't hold a charge well. Loses power much more quickly than other 3GS units I've owned. Shuts off with ~15% left. Yes, i calibrate the battery regularly. It doesnt help. Based on its shaky battery life and power quirks, I don't think this phone will be working much longer, so I feel a bit cheated."
"Apple",5,"IPhone 3gs is a solid smartphone. It is relatively light and compact. It has a premium feel and it is just beautiful. The battery lasts all day long on reasonably heavy used with screen brightness at 70-80 per cent. Call quality is solid and antenna reception is consistent."
"Apple",1,"The phone had pretty heavy scratches on the front and back, plus the back part was all cracked! The phone restarts itself all the time and the battery lasts 2 hous top! I bought it from Amazon Warehouse and definitely would NOT buy it again."
"Apple",4,"I got the iPhone in less than 24 hours ,no original iPhone box was in it ,some scratches on back ,screen perfect iPhone locked to at&t."
"Apple",5,"My iPhone works like new. It looks better than the description. Phone was unlocked, and ready to use! I love it. & I got it for a great price!!! I recommend it."
"Apple",5,"Absolute Value for money and this is what I expected from Amazon !.I received in neat packaging with all necessary accessories required."
"Apple",3,"I Just received the product, but i am really unable to know if it is working. The SIM CARD TRAY is missing. I can not insert the SIM CARD.Amazon adressed the issue ok so far."
"Apple",5,"my first 3G came severely discounted with the initial 2yr plan. 8mths later it was stolen. i didnt realize i couldnt purchas another at the same 'discounted' price. it was $3-400 to replace it.i got the identical phone through amazone for $150. i've yet to tell any difference, other than i use my password lock and my ""find my phone"" app...after i was told by AT&T and apple they 'couldnt trace' my original phone without it (which i dont believe). but either way...i'm 'older', not the most techy person, and probably i dont use the phone to its fullest potential, yet. but it serves my purpose thus far, and i have no complaints, yet. seemingly as with most smart phones, its made to be dropped (very slick and sleek) so i HIGHLY suggest purchasing some sort of silicone wrap for ease of grip or some 'hard cover' to protect it from when you drop it. its not a matter of IF, but when. the first one i didnt drop AT ALL for 8mths. i dropped the 2nd one twice in one week...but thankfully it was protected."
"Apple",4,"works very well, for the most part, but its unlocked so it took a little effort to get picture messaging to work and after every 5-7 texts or every phone call, I have to turn it off and back on to get signal."
"Apple",5,"Bought this used locked GSM iPhone 3GS 16GB for two reasons:1. it's sold by trust-worthy Amazon WarehouseDeals2. it's advertised that product was ""From the Manufacturer""Received the phone in excellent shape, well packed, like new, with the latest 5.0 firmware. It came with a new set of genuine Apple earphones with remote and mic, dock connector to USB cable and USB power adapter. Touchscreen and battery seemed to be newly replaced as well!Googled around, selected a company on the internet that claimed to be the No. 1 iPhone unlock service provider; after payment to them, received from them a message claiming that ""software was being developed and would be available soon (without a commitment date when software will be available)"". Since then, I've never been able to get my money back through PayPal!Fortunately, there's a professional independent iPhone repair shop in town (not at&t, T-Mobile or Cincinnati Bell) who could help activate, jailbreak and unlock my phone; the phone works great now! I don't have to purchase a 2-year plan, I can use the best-deal package plan I want from either at&t, T-Mobile or Cincinnati Bell any time. One important note: NEVER update your firmware after the unlock, otherwise, everything will be reset to previous locked configuration!"
"Apple",3,"The phone is nice condition, almost looks new but it is not unlocked! I have not had any luck unlocking it yet, but remain hopeful!"
"Apple",1,"I bought this iphone and discovered that it is LOCKED to AT&TDon't BUY , I am returning it back to Amazon warehouse !!!"
"Apple",5,"Had to order twice, first time I received incorrect product, but customer service was GREAT and handled everything expeditiously....my son loves it!"
"Apple",2,"I bought this iPhone to replace my old HTC Inspire but all i wound up with was an iPhone that shuts off randomly during use such as my phone calls, or texting so if you want to buy this phone I would reconsider if I were you."
"Apple",5,"bien"
"Apple",4,"Good"
"Apple",1,"Phone doesn't charge. When it is plugged in it is stuck in a loop. Tried to do recovery through iTunes app on computer and it failed before it even began. Worthless junk."
"Apple",3,"good phone"
"Apple",1,"was not so recommended"
"Apple",5,"thank you"
"Apple",4,"This is a great starter phone ,It came within a week and was in excellent condition My brother will have a blast with it"
"Apple",2,"This has been a disspointment. After a few months of usage the phone is not working well and giving problems. Sometimes it boots and other it doesn't. If you buy from this seller you are risking to have the phone go bad in a few weeks."
"Apple",1,"The touch feature would not work properly. Had to turn it sideways to get keys to work. Many times couldn’t even turn phone on to answer calls. Finally fixed it. Threw it on the floor and got another phone. No one else will have to deal with it."
"Apple",3,"good afternoon I received the phone is locked does not recognize the card without my line is movistar sim trajeta says that is not compatible"
"Apple",4,"I am enjoying my new phone. I still have a lot to learn about it. Just bought a new cover for it."
"Apple",5,"they come in ok condition ! but for the price you can complain !! its actually better than good but not very good cosmetic !! always buy from amazon and not 3rd party sellers !"
"Apple",4,"I would have given it a higher rating, but I had to get a SIM card Holder installed on the Phone. Other than that the phone seems to be working fine. Phone is in very good condition and was well packaged."
"Apple",5,"I bought this phone used through the Amazon Warehouse Deals. I wasn't expecting much, but I figured that if anything was wrong, I could simply return it.The box arrived in a few days, and I'm not exaggerating when I say that this phone was just like new. It came in its original packaging, with all of the accessories and manuals, and there were no visible scratches. The only thing that let me know that the phone was used was that the port where the charger goes and the speakers had gotten a little dusty. So, in short, the phone arrived in like-new condition.As for the phone itself, it's worked fine for me so far. I've been using it for about two weeks now, and I haven't encountered any problems. The only complaints I have are about AT&T and their service, not the phone itself. It bears repeating that if you get this phone, it's not unlocked and you're stuck with AT&T. If you can make peace with that, and one is on offer from Warehouse Deals, I highly recommend getting this phone!"
"Apple",4,"I was real nervous about buying an iPhone that was refurbished on-line but I am glad I only paid $100 for this 3G it was a great buy."
"Apple",3,"The phone is in great condition. no scratches , no acting funny , just the cord charger that came with the phone wont charge it. The box works just not the cord. I'm not happy with the charger not working but overall its been good !"
"Apple",5,"Quality was as advertised. An unlock is required before you can use your own SIM. There were no significant scratches and the product was up to standards."
"Apple",5,"I bought that phone it looks real good. I went to a thrift store and found a case to carry it in. It was brand new too. The battery doesn't hold a charge for very long. How long are they suppose to hold a charge? I have not used it yet nor have I went to see if it was unlocked or not. So I am wondering if the battery is good or has to be replaced. This is my first smart phone so I am ""DUH"" on the usage. Oh on the PayPal issue I have been waiting almost a year to get money back from them and that money came from my bank account. I did not use PayPal for payment. So GOOD LUCK. I love Amazon they ROCK!!!!"
"Apple",3,"the iphone 3gs is okay. the battery does not last long. i have to constancely keep it charged. i did receive the phone in a timely manner and the condition was good."
"Apple",1,"I look for an unlocked iphone and this was not. The article said iphone 3gs yet sent me an iphone 3g and I did not pay for it .... this is not right and it is wrong because it is a deception."
"Apple",5,"The product was exactly what I expected. Very Pleased. The phone came with all the original packaging and ""how to"" manual"
"Apple",1,"we had a lot of problems with this iphone from the beginingafter 3 weeks screen went blank could not use it, I sent it back to the vendor, hope i get my money back..."
"Apple",1,"Payed for the iphone on October 9th, October 30th was the latest to arrive from arizona to california and as of today (11-6) I'm still waiting.Of course I tracked it and long story short the product was delivered on 10-22 in Nigeria Africa ... What???!!!That's all I can say about the iPhone 3 I pay for a month ago, I'm hoping by the time it gets here it will be the iPhone 5 insteadBtw, Benjamin from amazon customer service has been great help, he's the positive part of this nightmare.Hopely my son gets compensated for all the frustration every day waiting for the postal service guy to show up bringing his phone."
"Apple",4,"I used it for a long time until my friend sold me his iPhone 4. Now my sister is using my old 3GS. She absolutely loves it. It came in perfect condition and was fast! I still wouldn't trade the 4 for the 3G but I loved the 3G non-the-less."
"Apple",5,"i wantto know if this phone is AT&T )) i want to bay it. please understand. thnx thnx thnx thnx thnx"
"Apple",3,"The phone arrived on time as indicated (That is good !). Phone screen is in good condition so far and the back cover has some scracthes. It is locked, but i have my AT&T SIM ready. As of now, the only thing that trouble me is the missing pin that use to open the SIM slot, the rest of the functions work just fine. I shall try to post more of this phone review, so stay tune."
"Apple",3,"Have had issues with ""no service"" several times, so far made 3 trips to AT and T.Replaced sim card and does not hold charge well. We keep hoping the issues will stop, still not sure if we will keep or return."
"Apple",1,"The phone appeared to be in good condition, but it is defective. It's difficult to hear. I thought it was the plastic over the phone but it wasn't & didn't realize it until a few weeks after i purchased the phone."
"Apple",1,"First off i put in my sim card and it wouldn't read it for like a whole night. it kept saying searching but wouldn't read it. When it finally read it the problem was it kept turning off randomly even though i was at 70% . Waste of $190"
"Apple",1,"When I received the iphone,i found it is fake and inferior product,the back cover is renovated,the receiver has a noise when you have a call,screen light-leaking,in a word,it is a bad iphone."
"Apple",5,"Yes I like my 3G first I can't connect to Internet but finally I got it and I happy with my selection thank you very much"
"Apple",4,"Came in factory box unopened, my niece hasn't had one problem with it. Programmed so easy for her straight talk activation"
"Apple",5,"I was using a an old iPhone 3 that a friend gave me and got to really like it. But then I accidentally got a lot of water on it and couldn't get it to work again. I bought another cheap mobile phone and was very dissatisfied with it--I wanted my iPhone back! I thought to look for a used iPhone on Amazon and was delighted to find many 3Gs for sale for under $100.00. It works great so far and I'm happy with it."
"Apple",1,"I received the phone with the ""on"" button missing. I took it into the apple store and they said it was counterfeit and refused to fix it. I contacted the seller but they refused to do anything."
"Apple",5,"i got this phone as a gift for my nephew i have had iPhone 3gs before so i know how they work , the phone is in mint condition but did not come with a charger, the phone is factory unlocked as promised and did not ship in the amount of time that it should this is also understandable and acceptable once you use the phone for the first time."
"Apple",4,"WORKING NICE AS PER EXPECTATIONS STILL I DID NOT COME ACROSS ALL THE FEATURES IT CONTAINS .PICTURE QUALITY IS EXCEPTIONAL."
"Apple",1,"I have trouble with receiving pictures . had to call my cell phone company and Im still having trouble. Its just wasn't what I expected. I also ordered the plastic cover and I still waiting for it. it now been 3 weeks"
"Apple",4,"The only thing I don't like is that I can't receive pictures from other people. If I could do that it would be great."
"Apple",5,"I bought it for my 14 years old, great condition exactly as describedI'll always use the seller and recommend to all my friends, great price and fast shipperThank you"
"Apple",5,"A++++fast"
"Apple",5,"all good"
"Apple",5,"It was excellent. thanks"
"Apple",5,"excellent phone ,excellent seller"
"Apple",1,"The item's charger did not work and it seems as though this is a fake or replica iPhone. I will have to take it to the Apple Store to know for sure but I'm unhappy with the product besides the fact that it took over two weeks to get here."
"Apple",5,"Great product works great"
"Apple",1,"it is not working.i like to return.. Very bad condition.it was not like i saw it in the add.it is totally garbage. i just trashed my money."
"Apple",5,"Perfect to use as ipod. Brand new."
"Apple",5,"Works great! Using it to help my grandma learn how to get up to date with technology!"
"Apple",1,"*** I GOT DUPLICATE IPHONE, AS SOON AS YOU GET THE PHONE PLEASE CHECK WHETHER IT IS ORIGINANL BY CALLING APPLE SUPPORT TO SAVE YOURSELF **** SELLER: WIRELESS MARKET""I bought the phone and it display gone bad within two months, and when I went to apple service center they checked the phone and said it is a duplicate product. And I said them that I got it from amazon. They said, they are facing many duplicate phone complaint from amazon purchases.I was further shocked!!!!I felt lonely and cheated by a big giant! I felt helpless. Depressed!!! It was a gift to my wife, and felt shame! felt insulted! Please be aware and save yourself.."
"Apple",1,"I buy one, but I was think it new but when I receive it I find that it look old and used and like be repaired"
"Apple",5,"Excellent product!"
"Apple",5,"I haven,try it yet. I will be using overseas and I am travelling in two days."
"Apple",5,"Works great"
"Apple",5,"very good iphone 3gs."
"Apple",2,"The speaker desnot work."
"Apple",5,"great"
"Apple",5,"Nice."
"Apple",5,"Nice phone as described great fast service"
"Apple",5,"thanks"
"Apple",5,"I needed an unlocked 3gs iPhone to use with my T-Mobile account. This phone came in an Apple box, never been used or repaired. I checked out many sites before I settled on this seller and I'm glad I did."
"Apple",4,"Nice phone, great value, I was looking for an iphone, but didnt want to pay $300 or $400 for a newer version, so I went with this 3gs. It arrived in like new condition with all the features of the iphone for a much more affordable price."
"Apple",1,"No recomiendo este vendedor, sus equipos son reconstruidos, el mio vino con problemas en la pantalla y estoy en venezuela es dificil que se me repare el daño!!!"
"Apple",4,"I do not know where Tablet Distributors got these 3GS Iphones (mine came with 2010 manufacturing date) in almost impeccable condition - but it is true. Unlocked, in a new factory box. The only tell that it was ""in hands"" is that the supplied USB cord was actually for 4 version, and would not charge 3GS. No big deal - there are plenty of old cables around. 4 stars for that, but $237 deal is sweet. The same phone in Target would cost $150 more.It will work with almost any carrier except probably Verizon (I use cheap $30 T-mobile 5 GB plan, no contract and no activation fee). Be aware that 3GS Iphone uses normal, not mini SIM card. Mini SIM would work, but with the adapter."
"Apple",5,"todo perfecto como lo describianlo recomiendo.. sigan asi..todo perfecto como lo describianlo recomiendo.. sigan asi.. mejor imposibletodo perfecto como lo describianlo recomiendo.. sigan asi..todo perfecto como lo describianlo recomiendo.. sigan asi.. mejor imposible"
"Apple",5,"The iphone is the same that the seller discribe. Is new, and work perfect.I recomend this product for all people who wants to have an iphone and don't want to pay to much por a cel phone."
"Apple",5,"Apple is as apple does....thank God! :-) love this phone! It works perfectly, was unlocked and came with clear instructions about how to connect to the iStore, etc. Love it. Mine was white, not black as pictured. I didnt care because it's covered anyway. But if you do care, you may want to make sure. Also, mine is slightly cracked, the shell on back, close to the charging inut. Does NOT interfere with operations but just FYI. I've chosen to keep it because it works perfectly. Arrived when expected. Good value for the price."
"Apple",1,"I bought a phone and they sent me a damage one. Not recommended. I hate it completely. Not good at all."
"Apple",4,"It's perfect, factory unlocked.Works well in Brazil.I already updated and no problem at all.Apple products are great."
"Apple",5,"Great working order. Came packaged safely and wasn't moving around in the box. Was shipped out immediately. Greatly appreciated. Thanks."
"Apple",2,"The charger that came with the phone doesn't charge the phone it says ""Charging isn't supported with this accessory."" At the bottom of the screen there is some discoloration and there are a lot of small/medium scratches. It was only $30 so I didn't expect much but the phone works fine and was unlocked like advertised and I was able to use it on my plan."
"Apple",1,"unfinished return"
"Apple",5,"In great shape for the age of it, had a crack in back and SIM tray was damaged but it's all perfect! Works like it should! Worth the price!"
"Apple",1,"The phone dies after 15 mins fully charged - NO KIDDING"
"Apple",5,"This turned out to be a NEW unused IPhone - it worked great right out of the box - lost mine when I left it for 5 minutes on a restaurant table."
"Apple",5,"I just didn't like it"
"Apple",5,"Nice phone !"
"Apple",2,"ok"
"Apple",5,"as described and works well"
"Apple",1,"I bought two of these phones. One of them worked fine, but the other decided to stop working about three months after I bought it. It wasn't charging so I bought a different charger and it still didn't work. When I called iTunes help center about an issue I had with the apps, when it was still working, I gave them the number inside the phone and they told me that the phone had been bought years ago, so it's DEFINITELY not new. I never would have bought it had I known it was used, refurbished, or whatever this was."
"Apple",5,"muy bueno"
"Apple",4,"Very good service and phone working well."
"Apple",5,"Great phone. If you get a 3 make sure it's a 3gs. Nice rugged feel."
"Apple",4,"Got it as expected - unlocked, factory-sealed and in good working condition!"
"Apple",5,"My wife loves it. Works great. Thank you soon much."
"Apple",2,"very bad phone"
"Apple",4,"Still working and that is all that counts. :)"
"Apple",5,"Excellente"
"Apple",1,"Did not work as expected. GSM sim did not work on it even though it said unlocked smh"
"Apple",3,"Good"
"Apple",5,"Love my new IPhone, so easy to use, great price"
"Apple",4,"A very good price for what you are getting. It's not the best phone out there and it's a little slow, but if you're only looking for a cheap smartphone to talk and text on, this is is the phone for you."
"Apple",5,"Exactly as described"
"Apple",5,"Basic use for calls and texting. Works great."
"Apple",5,"Looks almost new. Started working as soon as SIM was inserted."
"Apple",1,"dose not work with verizon but every nice people"
"Apple",5,"Very happy with my iphone 3GS. I got a great price. I took it to at&t and they set it up for me in 15 minutes."
"Apple",5,"it's working perfectly!"
"Apple",5,"Very Happy"
"Apple",1,"Too good to be true. When I received this phone (fulfilled by Amazon), it looked new. It was sealed. But upon using it, it's obviously refurbished??? It wouldn't read my wi-fi and sim card. Also it keeps shutting off on its own even when it's fully charged. The browser freezes a lot as well. Beware."
"Apple",1,"The phone described as new and it looked like new when it arrived. The home button was not working as new and few other problems and hence checked with apple with the IMEA. They clearly confirmed its a refurbished phone. So disappointed."
"Apple",5,"Love this phone. it arrived exactly as described and was factory unlocked and not at all jail broken (like my other phone from a cellular service provider). I could set up our new phone plan in about 10 minutes and it is fully up to date! I will recommend this seller to every one I know.Thanks again!"
"Apple",1,"Unfortunately the product did not meet my expectations. I could not update the version of IOS (was only in the number 4). This shows that the device was unlocked not in the way that appears in the ad. I had to pay a technical assistance that confirmed the problem. I would return it and get my money back. I bought two devices on two different dates and two had the same problem."
"Apple",1,"I bought this phone to replace one exactly like it since my started having problems. I was so excited when I received it; however, it will not import my contacts, capital letters do not work when you push the arrow key and will not even find my carrier. I am so disappointed in this particular purchase."
"Apple",5,"I was shopping for a replacement of 3GS after my daughter broke my phone. I was worried with some of the reviews after I placed the order. The Phone was in very good condition, unlocked, I just had to insert the SIM card and restore the backup from iCloud. I just had to spent 5 minutes to get going with this phone. I will certainly recommend this seller to my friends."
"Apple",1,"I ordered two ""New"" iPhones, what i received were refurbished phones. I was planning to gift it but.....Now I visited apple outlet and bought tow ""New"" iPhone 4s..."
"Apple",5,"Excellent service and easy to use. Would recommend this product to others. plan to use it for a long time"
"Apple",5,"iphone keeps an innovate desing, easy to operate, fast in internet an limited with some apps but iphone 3gs is still a good choosefor the price"
"Apple",1,"got it last month and it doesnt work any more ... i just cant tur it on .. when i connect it to the wall charger it turns on for a while and after a minute or two or if i unpluge it it dies ----- please need help if anybody knows how to fix it //// im in argentina and theres no apple store here.."
"Apple",5,"EL IPHONE ESTA CASI NUEVO ACTUALIZADO A LA VERSION EN OPTIMAS CONDICIONES OFERTA INMEJORABLE EN LA TIENDA EN LINEA Y CONTRAPARTE"
"Apple",1,"Item had some dents and very visible wear, was not ""New"" as described in the listing, that is incredible for the price that I pay! i go to return this item!"
"Apple",5,"Arrived quickly, works absolutely fine."
"Apple",3,"Good iPhone but not what i'm looking for"
"Apple",1,"friends shari the phone you buy is used and then restored is not new battery does not last long and I connect it to charge the battery and after 10 or 15 min loads the cel and deconectarlo low battery 70 or 80 % of a ud once again publish the phone is not new and should not publish again I feel cheated by this situation"
"Apple",5,"this was worth every penny"
"Apple",5,"I bought this phone for my 14-years old son. I wanted an iPhone, but not paying for it. So this 3GS was perfect and cost me a fraction of the iPhone 5."
"Apple",1,"I am not satisfied with phone,As it's not working properly and displaying screen was not good.Poor co lour display.Less quality."
"Apple",5,"100% reliable recommend thanks for everything"
"Apple",3,"Good"
"Apple",5,"Everything was as promised and expected."
"Apple",3,"It's ok"
"Apple",5,"Very happy with purchase, works great"
"Apple",5,"I bought this as a gift for my niece, she loved it (never had a smart phone before)what can I tell you, is an iPhone"
"Apple",5,"Good buy.. For an iPhone.. New!!"
"Apple",5,"good product"
"Apple",5,"Item as described and is unlocked not jailbroken as they have stated very satisfied with this iPhone 3GS 8GB bought it brand new Sheri international was very quick to ship it out and very well packed in the shipping box they use UPS very good delivery system to use when shipping or fedex both are very good company to use when shipping i have T-Mobile on prepaid service the iPhone 3GS was very easy to set up to it i had windows 8.1 nokia 521 which is ok but i like Apple Cell phone's better the transfer was very easy for it all u need is adapters to switch the cards out."
"Apple",1,"Got this phone for my parents Christmas gift. The home button spoiled in two days, can't use the phone because you can't come out of the last App. Unfortunately I'm not able to return the phone. Don't buy!"
"Apple",1,"I saw a lot of great reviews about this phone, and I thought I would be one of those lucky ones who wrote these great reviews. I was so excited to find out that the battery works fine yesterday. Unfortunately, this phone couldn't be activated in the store today. It doesn't recognize sim card; maybe it's a locked phone. It's been a waste of my time. I just want to break this phone right now, but I guess I should get my money back. It's not worth it. I bought it from ROSS CELLULAR, btw."
"Apple",5,"Son loved phone and I liked the price point. He needed phone for oversees to use while away from home.As of May 2015: Purchased in Dec. 2014, started using in Jan. 2015. No longer wish for the 5 stars, after 5 months of use this is the update on this phone: speakers making screeching noise, phone would freeze up, now pretty much not charging any longer. It served its purpose but lasted only 5 months. Too bad. (only used for text and online stuff, with a very occasional phone call)"
"Apple",5,"Phone was exactly what was described. Great shape, brand new. Not a scratch. Much more affordable than getting a newer iPhone, or a two year service contract."
"Apple",5,"The unlocked 3GS is a great phone. The remarkable thing is that there was no programming involved whatsoever when I put in my Simple Mobile (T-Mobile) chip. Calls, texts and internet work fine right from the get-go."
"Apple",4,"I love my new iPhone. It's just like an iPod except that I can make phone calls with it. Unfortunately, the charger didn't work and I had to use my iPod charger to charge the phone. I like the fact that it's unlocked because I can use it when I travel to Europe."
"Apple",1,"The device sent by this merchant to me did not work. It did not charge even leaving it plugged in for more than 24 hours. On top of all that, the device failed to activate."
"Apple",3,"compared to my htc sensation (yes I know that phone is wayy advanced and the comparison would be unfair) which I destroyed by getting it wet, of course it*s hard for me to give the Iphone 3s a fair review.However, here my review:The Iphone 3 is pretty and has most things you would need in a smart phone.I like the texting, even though sometimes texts especially pictures won*t send and I have to send it over and over- despite having service in the area!service..... yes, sometimes there is no service in an area for no reason. kind of annoying. I always had service with my htc so it is not my service provider. My friend who has the Iphone3 says the same thing.. very annoying.I was spoiled by having a gps tell me when to turn - the iphone 3 comes with a navigation system which is a lifesaver so and so often - but you still have to flip thru the steps manually as you go which can get you a ticket or killed at times.Some of the apps I could get for free for Android I have to pay for now.. bummer.The camera is terrible sadly, no flash, and no front screen camera..However, the phone works, it*s pretty, and if you use your phone mainly for calling and texting and only need the internet at times it works very well. I love the way the voicemails are set up!!!I don*t understand btw why apple makes the front screen from glass! I could drop my htc on concrete ten times a day and not a scratch would be on the screen but now when my Iphone slips my grip I nearly have a heart attack!"
"Apple",4,"I never saw a review that indicated someone using the iPhone on Straight Talk but it does work on it.The iPhone arrived FACTORY UNLOCKED! So that was good. There are sites you can check to see if the iPhone is factory unlocked by inputting the MEID. I slipped in the SIM card and it works. The only thing is that the iPhone is a little beat up. You can tell that the screen was replaced cause they did not clean the under screen before applying the new screen and you can see dirt in it when looking at the screen in the light, which can be annoying.The iPhone works and battery is good. The quality is not the best and the phone was Factory Unlocked and works on Straight Talk."
"Apple",5,"Considering the cost of smartphones today, they are as expensive as laptops at 1/10th the size. I do not need the latest phones so my needs are not that essential, however, if you are looking for a great phone, the 3GS is it. The price I got it for was fantastic and I use it with the Straight Talk plan. Of course, the Iphone does do everything so I am very happy with the purchase. Thanks!"
"Apple",5,"It took me several years to persuade my husband to buy iPhone for himself. Finally, the price of this iPhone 3GS made a trick and for couple of weeks already he is a satisfied user.The phone came with all accessories, but the box and brochure were not original. So far it works perfectly, the battery keeps as it should and there are no problems with the use."
"Apple",4,"Easy to use, just love this phone. My first iPhone glad that it came with direction. My wife use this phone more than I do, she loves it also."
"Apple",1,"I was really excited to get my phone. From the very first charge it stopped and started charging. I did not send back, this was my 1st I-phone and I didn't know if this was something that just came with the territory. 2 months later, the phone won't take a charge. It's a brick and it's too late to get a refund.It now serves as a pretty paperweight.Don't get ripped off thinking your experience will be different, you are flipping a coin."
"Apple",4,"Product arrived as advertised...had USB wall plug and connector. Phone did not have most recent update, but easily accepted it. Arrived charged which was nice. No case or instructions, but the screen was immaculate and only very minor wear was shown on the back of the phone.Fired up immediately after installing my TMobile sim card in the tray. Good deal and great price."
"Apple",5,"I ordered it for other than myself, but I did ask for review. As the person said it is a great purchase and very satisfied with it. Came with the original boxing just like You buy it in an apple store personally. Perfect in every single way, especially the pricing."
"Apple",5,"the phone works well and was what was described in the adi have had no problems with the unit"
"Apple",3,"it had a few scratches in the back of the phonethe screen looked great, brand new.however the the plug in wall charger does not work and cannot make the phone chargehad to buy a iphone charger.overall its a good phone battery is great, i can do everything i want and it functions very well."
"Apple",5,"The phone was maintained very good as described. I tested for 3 weeks and all are working. Shipped very fast. I like the phone."
"Apple",5,"A good telephone in a good condition. Arrived quickly. Nice that it had a new charger and a protection for the screen. Thank you!"
"Apple",5,"It is very good and almost as good as new. The charger's cable was chewed by a dog, but I bought a new one and it's working."
"Apple",5,"Bought from UnlockedCellPhoneKings refurbished. Arrived fast, in excellent conditions, like new.Everything as expected, unlocked, and all original accesories (charger, manual, etc.) were included.Read reviews carefully, you can notice there are a lot of bad experiences with some vendors offering ""new"" devices.Know the vendor before buying."
"Apple",1,"I bought this iphone as ""new"" and when i received it i realized it was furbished and it did not work. I ask someone to help in this case."
"Apple",5,"I'm not too interested in having the latest technology I just wanted an iOS device that was a little more portable than my iPad 3 and I happened to be needing a new phone as well, so I decided to go with the iPhone 3GS. It was just as described by the seller, brand new, a great price, works well on iOS 6 and adequately runs all of the apps that I use frequently. Maybe later I will be tempted to update to a newer model but for now I am satisfied. Great product."
"Apple",5,"Product was brand new, and was factory unlocked I was able to upgrade the software and register it with apple like it so much I am buying a second handset for my fiancée only problem is that the price went up"
"Apple",5,"Came like a new phone (box, charger, instuctions, ear buds, tool) looked excellent and had no problem with it working except home button was a little sticky, wont complain very pleased for the price."
"Apple",1,"three days ago to remove the bad rate hoping that I would solve the problem. the phone is useless. also not up service button from the main panel does not work. was a Christmas present and I was forced to give my personal iphone. not want to call. free to contact me via email as any salesman. I am very upset because I feel ripped off and not take away this rate until you have the product under the conditions in which it was purchased. I also lined in this shell. used is not very good is used acceptable, if the problem can not solve my money back."
"Apple",1,"I 'd like to ask how should we do to fix my iphone, came with some problem, it;s not working properly.What i have to do to have it fixed??ThanksMIroel"
"Apple",5,"I've owned a Iphone 3gs before but it feel in a bucket of water. I wanted an iphone but I did not wanted the 4 or the 5. In my opinion the 3g and 3gs were the best built models. The product arrived before the estimated date, it was unlocked and the quality looked (and works) like new."
"Apple",5,"I have tried to return this phone but I can not get any information on how or where to return it, it does not work for me and Verizon Wireless will not make it ready for me to use. I have put in a claim as instructed by Amazon but still have not gotten a reply. The apple phone is too old orjust not usable....I desparately need help with this I need to return it so that my credit card can be credited and I will buy a new one that my carrier Verizon Wireless will accept....MY FRIENDS ARE LAUGHING AT ME FOR GETTING SUCH A BAD DEAL ON MY FIRST ATTEMPT AT SHOPPING ON AMAZON..."
"Apple",2,"It was very good but some of the keys are not working, so i was constrained to send it back."
"Apple",1,"this is an untruthful sellerthe first iphone he sent me, the front button won't work. said with charger but nothing.contact ...sent charger, but can't be used !sent another iphone. But battery die every 40 minutes talk !I give up. I throw $144 to the dirt.don't buy anything from this seller"
"Apple",2,"These Iphones arrived with batteries that only lasted 20 mins. I was forced to buy new replacement batteries. Not as advertised."
"Apple",5,"I got this phone for my mom , and she loves it she still is new to the iphone .. we are showing her step by step how to use different Apps on the phone but other than that she likes it and its UNLOCKED !!!!!!"
"Apple",1,"Crappy phone, completely lied, Not Jailbroken! Was told by 2 different cellular carriers they couldn't do anything with the phone! Complete waste of my money worst purchase to date from Amazon!"
"Apple",5,"I was afraid to purchase an iPhone 5 for my 11 year old but he needed the phone for safety. This iPhone 3 was in perfect condition and his friends all want one now. Easy to order and fast delivery with great price."
"Apple",2,"Although the description says ""Can be upgraded, factory unlocked for any GSM carrier"" AND again states ""ready to be used on any GSM carrier worldwide"". They need to put a disclaimer that says, ""Well... any GSM carrier EXCEPT Verizon Wireless"" because they can NOT be activated on Verizon wireless. The main reason, that I understand, is the mere fact that Verizon never had a 3g iPhone, so they don't have 3g SIM cards compatible with the iPhone and the 4g SIM cards they do have will not work in the iPhone 3gS. I tried my best to get the phone activated but it was just a huge waste of time. If you have Verizon, don't bother - it's not gonna work and its just going to cause you a huge headache.One the positive side, the phone itself was very nice. It appeared to be brand new, in the box with all the accessories. Although the USB cable is not Apple brand, the description does say it includes a 'compatible' USB cable. Everything else seems legit, it turned on and the screen was flawless and bright. Just disappointed I didn't do my research about the 3g/4g SIM card business.The seller, Better Deals FASTER, was very professional and understanding. I was able to return the phone and have my money refunded as soon as they received the phone back.Buyer Tip of the Day: do your HOMEWORK and know what your carrier can activate before you go around buying $200 phones!"
"Apple",1,"when the battery charge drops to 70% the phone is turned off, data cable does not work.The phone looks new."
"Apple",3,"Phone was unlocked, but didn't come in a box and there was no ear piece. Therefore not sure if it was new as it was advertised"
"Apple",5,"Fast shipping good condition itemIt was well packed and shipped in a timely manor .Going to use it in Europe so have not had the chance to see how it works, but it looks good."
"Apple",4,"it was just ok! The purchased was ONLY the phone! Not like the Picture with Accessories and BOX!No Box, No Accessories! Just PHONE!"
"Apple",5,"works good. you can bank on apple product though pricy. Limited with what you can personally do compare to android phone."
"Apple",3,"I'll get to the point. I bought the phone new. I had it only two days when the on/off button fell off. I can still turn it on and off by using my fingernail. The camera's picture quality for low light could be sharper. The box wasn't factory wrapped in plastic when it arrived (which was sooner than its estimated time) so I have to wonder if it really was new. So besides the two flaws it's still a nice phone."
"Apple",4,"Phone came 100% brand new ! everything in mint condition and was great 4 stars cause it came without a charger"
"Apple",4,"what a deal on an entry level Iphone, my wife is learning to be tech savy, without paying the high price for 5S"
"Apple",5,"so far everything is great end up ""Happy"""
"Apple",4,"Works great"
"Apple",5,"great seller.phone new in factory box"
"Apple",5,"Great"
"Apple",5,"perfect gift"
"Apple",5,"Kids loved them"
"Apple",1,"Phone does not work, it turns off by itself and does not hold charge."
"Apple",5,"Excelente"
"Apple",5,"Excellent."
"Apple",1,"was lost"
"Apple",3,"I ordered this for my mother and it had no sim card slot. I had to buy it and have it shipped. It doesn't say anything about this in the description of the product."
"Apple",1,"The charger did not work, there was a huge scratch on the screen, and a even bigger crack by the charging port. Would have pasted with so many issue if they would have been explained in detail. Shipping was fast and timely so that's why I'm posting review"
"Apple",5,"The phone came quickly and met all of my expectations. After a month, it has worked flawlessly and done everything I needed. Good seller and good product!"
"Apple",1,"Why is it so difficult for the vendor to provide a product as specified on Amzn? This product was not factory unlocked and my T-Mobile SIM card did not get any signal on this phone, whereas it got a full signal on my Google phone."
"Apple",5,"The phone works fine and as soon as I inserted the SIM card. Also, I appreciate your thank you card."
"Apple",5,"excellent product"
"Apple",5,"Nothing better you can get for the price and the appearance. I really would recommend to anyone looking for a smartphone to test drive an older iphone first to see how they like it. It's a cheaper test run and it's fully functional. I would recommend this to anyone"
"Apple",5,"Even if already has a newer version of iPhone, the 3GS still a good purchase, everything works fine, good for our kids."
"Apple",5,"Love the phone and got a great price for it. Good for anyone who's looking for a nice cheap and useful smartphone for everyday use. Using for the tmobile line. works great"
"Apple",1,"This product looks great! but it not work as expected, sometimes it restart itself without any cause, when i receive calls I cannot hear the caller's voice, the same occurs when i make calls, no body can hear me.If you ask me if i would purchase this or another used product from this vendor. My answer is NOT, radically.With this product really feel that i lost my money."
"Apple",5,"I ordered the Apple iPhone 3GS 8GB Black Factory Unlocked / Not Jailbroken from PUT group USA and received the item exactly as it was described (i.e. new). The phone holds its charge as expected (about two days of light use) and worked seamlessly once I inserted my T-Mobile sim card. Comes with the latest OS with which it is compatible(6.1.3). Note that OS 7 is not supported on the 3GS, but the majority of apps will run on it, as does iCloud. Given the cost of new iPhones (which are admittedly more powerful with crisper displays) I think the $149 that this goes for is a good bargain. If you are also looking for a reasonably priced case, see the eForCity 2 x TPU Rubber Skin Case Compatible With Apple® iPhone® 3G / 3GS, Clear Smoke Circle which I bought for under $3 including postage. For some inexplicable reason this is cheaper than buying a single case of exactly the same type. It fits the phone snugly, feels nice to the touch, and offers good protection against damage."
"Apple",3,"The power button was broke even though shipping was good. I hoped a brand new phone. Otherwise it is good working."
"Apple",5,"It is a very good phone though is not the most current works excellent recommend i can hear music in my iphone"
"Apple",4,"This phone is just as the seller describe it, it works very well. Only complaint is, it does not have the volume that our old phone did. But of course this is not the sellers fault."
"Apple",3,"It has missing part: Sim holder. I dont like this one because I cannot use it until I buy the sim card holder."
"Apple",5,"I needed an older iphone, because I have problems with Retina displays with my eyes. I found this phone at a great price. It came in great condition exactly as described by Tech 232. It works perfectly."
"Apple",1,"This phone is advertised as ""New"", definitely not true: the signs of tear and wear are there. The box is not official,so it is refurbished at best. It says ""factory unlocked not jailbroken"", but menu Settings-About-Carrier says ""T-Mobile"".The battery on the unit I received was dead: it did not charge. The box and charger had signs of glue and dirt, theytried to make it look like factory wrapping, but did not try hard.I am considering filing a claim to small business court: this is a false advertisement."
"Apple",4,"I bought one 3Gs from this page once, but from different seller. That one was faulty. I contacted Amazon, cause that was fulfilled by Amazon. I returned the phone. Amazon immediately gave my money back. Impressed! So, I bought this one from a different seller. This seller is also fulfilled by Amazon. It is working fine till now. I am still in the coverage of 30 days. I hope I do not have to return it. So far so good."
"Apple",1,"I just bought this iphone 3gs. It's such a nightmare. It's a refurbished phone. Defective phone, Defective charger.Not working!! Total waste of money. Don't buy this."
"Apple",1,"I order a iPhone 3GS and i got an use iPhone 3G and the on/off botton is not working properly . I am returnig the product and i hope they send me a new iPhone 3GS wish i paid for."
"Apple",1,"Does not work well with sim card-though unlocked. Buy maybe for spare parts-Seller has numerous complaints on Internet- so don't bother."
"Apple",5,"excellente"
"Apple",5,"cheap reliable phone.This for a friend that needed a spare phone. apple is always better than Android. phone arrived with zero scratches. better than I expected. was unlocked as promised and according to my friend it was so easy to start using. he is happy!."
"Apple",3,"Fast, clear and easy to navigate. Because it is an older model, there are features we wish we had, like auto correct."
"Apple",5,"All my purchases was always on time and to my expectation. So far I have never had any problem nether with the delivery or with the contact of what I purchased"
"Apple",5,"my mother is always on this phone."
"Apple",1,"This phone kept coming apart as it was not well assembled. It eventually stopped working after 35 days. The seller promised to replace it but has failed since October 2014 to provide me with a return address 😂😫"
"Apple",4,"Its cool."
"Apple",5,"perfect"
"Apple",4,"so far so good. I received brand new in factory packaging. Good deal."
"Apple",5,"fine"
"Apple",5,"Excellent product! It just came like brand new!"
"Apple",4,"Not bad at all. I bought this iPhone 3gs ""new"" - really my first real smart phone. It gets the job done - I'm able to use the few little apps that prompted it's purchase in the first place (shazam and a guitar tuner) and I get basic internet.The quality of sound for actual phone calls is a bit lacking though with a blue tooth (I bought a basic jabra) that remedies that. A good smart phone if you aren't going to crazy, and these are relatively affordable these days. I'd recommend."
"Apple",5,"very good"
"Apple",4,"Looks brand new!"
"Apple",3,"Personally, I would NEVER purchase any Apple hardware for myself - this was a gift. It arrived, it powered up, it connected to T-Mobile."
"Apple",5,"excelente"
"Apple",1,"Not funcionan en Venezuela."
"Apple",1,"used refurbished lousy battery- died very quickly do not buy this phone"
"Apple",2,"It stopped working before I knew it. It would not charge."
"Apple",4,"If you need to enjoy all the goodies a smart phone has, this is it! No contracts, factory unlock, great price."
"Apple",1,"I bought a new mobile, but this is not a new mobile. In two month the battery don't function!!!!It's a shame that people cheat. You must say that this mobile is a refurbished."
"Apple",1,"I purchased this item when i was in US and after i came back to my country this home button in the iphone did not work. When i contacted the seller that i m in india he didnt bother to reply me. This is such a bad experience."
"Apple",3,"I got this item on time and really very clean and no scratches.Two things I notice about the product.one is the slot for the sim card.After I placed my simcard inside I can't remove it anymore,the slot won't come out.Next one is the battery.Even if the wifi is off as well as the others that sucks the energy of the battery I always end up charging it.Battery life cuts in half after 2 hours even when not in use but the phone is still on. Using Skype ,front camera is not functioning even if the OS is already up to date.I'm still using the Iphone and did not return it to the seller because I'm avoiding the hassles of returns.Still I'm rating it with 3 stars.To the business owner who sold this item to me please screen your products carefully before shipping it out.In that way you can leave a very good impression to your future customers.Thank you and I hope this helps everybody who loves to shop online just like me as well as the merchants whose aim is customer satisfaction."
"Apple",5,"very attentive to the item, shipping came the day scheduled in good condition. Recommended 100% and there were no problems with the purchased item"
"Apple",1,"Have had the phone for less than 18 hours and the stupid thing is continuously restarting and unusable. Returns are a MESS with this seller as well... Don't buy it."
"Apple",5,"The 3 gs has slightly less resolution than the I4 but It is so clear I don't think you would notice the difference. The only other difference between the 2 is that the I4 has 2 camera,front and rear for video chatting. The I4 gs is the same as the I4 except Siri was added. IF you don't need your phone to talk to you and you don't need video chatting then the 3gs does everything else. It came with the latest upgrade of the IOS operating system and the screen was scratch free. While I don't understand it completely apparently there is a big difference between factory Unlocked and Jailbroken. It is my understanding that when jailbroken any upgrade re-locks the phone. Can't say enough good about the seller. As advertised and delivered on time at a very low price for what I got = a great value. When its time to upgrade I will return here to purchase."
"Apple",1,"After having a few weeks with the phone, I just was frustrated how badly it worked. It connected to the network but then work shut off for awhile even the wifi would not connect. The battery would die very fast and the headphones was not working. It just was not good at all. Just know what you are buying online before you get it."
"Apple",5,"Phone was as described, new, in the original box. Phone worked perfectly and easily logged onto our carrier network once we installed the SIM card. Delivery was in reasonable time, if you want a new older style iPhone this is the one for you."
"Apple",1,"I cannot get service in my home. The carrier is blaming apple and apple blames the carrier. I live in a big city so this should not happen."
"Apple",5,"Thanks! I am happy with the product. Everything was deliver on time and works perfectly!"
"Apple",5,"""Awesome!!!"
"Apple",5,"Great product. Good value for money."
"Apple",5,"Met and surpassed my expectations all round.Very good buy."
"Apple",5,"good"
"Apple",1,"I ORDERED THIS PHONE THAT SPECIFICALLY SAYS NEW ON THE DESCRIPTION. ONLY TO RECEIVE A USED PHONE. I WAS TOLD BY THE COMPANY THAT I WOULD GET A NEW PHONE TO COMPENSATE. NEVER GOT THE NEW PHONE AND NEVER HEARD BACK FROM THEM. DO NOT BUY FROM THIS SELLER."
"Apple",1,"I was expecting a new device with no problem and from the beggining the device was not factory unlocked and required to be jailbroken. The device never worked not even for voice after taking it to several service centers in Peru. In addition this was intended as a gift for my father end up spending $100 dollars in attempted repairs and have a useless equipment"
"Apple",1,"took this supposedly ""unlocked and new"" iphone to my carrier to be activated and it could not be used as it was a return or something like that. Returned it and got my money back. Bought directly from apple instead. It was more expensive but it was worth it to get a phone that actually works."
"Apple",1,"I never gonna buy again bcs they said unlocked but it's not. I've to spend money for unlocked still I don't know it's gonna work or not."
"Apple",1,"THIS IS A REFURBISHED IPHONE, WAS VERY RUSTY AND DAMAGED... AND THE TOUCH SCREEN WAS DAMAGED TO... I WANT MY MONEY FOLLOW BACK... I WANT A TOTALLY REFAUND... PLEASE I NEED A SOLUTION, BECAUSE I PAID FOR THIS. I BUY AN IPHONE 3GS UNLOCKED NEW, AND I RECIVED AN IPHONE REFURBISHED AND DAMAGED. THIS IS A REFURBISHED IPHONE, WAS VERY RUSTY AND DAMAGED...

"Apple",5,"Awesome phone it works great!! Very pleased"
"Apple",3,"Phone is in great shape. Works very well. Is unlocked, so was able to use it on another service, BUT could not have access to data. Could use the internet, if you wifi to log into, but could not send or receive mms or anything else that you would normally use your data for, including the Internet. YES, the phone line pays for and should have data! Took phone to phone service tech and they said that it was because it's an AT&T phone and the ""data usage"" part of the phone was still locked....???? Other than that, for an older phone, it's great. If the person who needed it was on AT&T , it would be awesome."
"Apple",2,"I don't like it"
"Apple",5,"I had my original Iphone 3g for years and then it finally started dying on me. I'm not into buying the new versions every time one comes out. I'm someone that sticks with a good thing when I find it. I love the original 3g and ordered this phone. It works perfectly. The battery life is exceptional. Very very happy with this purchase and highly recommend this seller."
"Apple",5,"Great phone for the price!"
"Apple",5,"good telephone"
"Apple",5,"Excellent exactly as described thanks"
"Apple",1,"This phone was not working after using it for 3weeks."
"Apple",5,"Perfect condition"
"Apple",5,"Err:508"
"Apple",5,"It was even nicer than anticipated and works great!!! It looked brand new as described. It had all the manufacturer parts included and they were all in mint condition."
"Apple",5,"i really like it so much and it met all my expectations and the seller met all the promises , thanks a lot"
"Apple",1,"got the phone couldn't make it work no matter what I did the damn thing just kept saying ""not able to activate"" I ended up having to buy another Iphone from att and it work just fine."
"Apple",4,"The phone shipped to me by Chubbiestech is in really good condition! Works exactly as described and was Unlocked (with no cell company logos) and not jailbroken! Chubbiestech was very nice to deal with and I will look for them in the future when I'm shopping used iPhones.The 3GS I received seems to work fully including, cell-radio (works with T-Mobile pre-pay), GPS-A, works with several map applications I have tried, all free and all ""off-line"", meaning I turned-off the WiFi radio and relied completely on the GPS-A configuration. The phone also works with the Magellan ""Tough Case"" battery/GPSr waterproof case.The phone also works in my Volkswagen through the Volkswagen Media Device Interface (MDI). The only thing I have not bothered to test is the headphone connection, sorry about that... I have other gizmos for media play-back.Bluetooth works, phone links-up with my in-car hands-free thing.WiFi works through my home setup.iTunes ""likes"" this phone and while it only has 8GB of total memory, I can still carry a good off-line map and a bunch of audio books. (play them through the car radio)Overall, a great buy! I don't use this as my daily phone, I use a Treo 680 for that but as a 'leave it in the car' phone, this is very good."
"Apple",1,"it said it was unlocked but it wasn't, but the owner was nice enough to return the item with a future discount"
"Apple",1,"The cellphone wad not unlocked. I tried many times with different sim cards and with tech support and could not unlock it. I wanted to return it today but saw the return window closed yesterday. I will have to file a chargeback."
"Apple",4,"Phones are working good. The phones initially did not accept the charge then I found out that it is because of the cable and the power adapter. So I bought new cables from autozone and power adapter from Walmart to fix the problem and it worked. Some of the marks on the phones does not imply me that it is a brand new one and guess may be a used one. That is what the packaging label also indicated. Not original packaging. Any way for $135 this phone is ok until to get another newer version. Basically the features are working good. You can buy this phone but do not trust the cable and their power adapter. IMJ"
"Apple",4,"The phone came sealed and did not have a sign of usage in any way, I Checked up on it with the Apple Store and was told that it was sold to a store here in the US few Years ago and the Warranty on it is Expired, so if you are the kind that take care of your phone, that would be a good choice for you"
"Apple",5,"Great phone. I bought it for my daughter and she loves it. She has it assigned to Straight talk service and it works great."
"Apple",5,"I wasn't sure if I should buy a used phone online as you know they could potentially have a lot of issues.Got phone, and worked like a charm, I have had it for a while now and have had no issues."
"Apple",1,"I asked for a iphone 3gs Factory unlocked and sent me a locked iphone 3g, really does not help me in my country.I feel cheated by this supplier PSXPRO.Be careful with this supplier.Finally I will have to pay 40.00 dollars to return the product they mistakenly sent me.Be careful when selecting the supplier when shopping."
"Apple",1,"The phone is not new! In a new, disgusting smelling body established fee from your old phone, which apparently returned by reason of marriage. Unstable network and in standby mode not received calls. What a disappointment! Moreover, it was a gift! In the end, I throw away 169 dollars."
"Apple",5,"I have heard a lot about Iphones and have always wanted one but always found the current generation kinda pricey. I bought this as as my trial Iphone and after I charged it up and did some basic settings, I saw why Iphone adherents rave about them. I'm impressed and am already looking to buy a 4G.."
"Apple",2,"I Think I am returning this item, first of all, because they where not clear of the ""New"" phone, that it looks like new but the accesories are not original, and the battery from the phone lasts so little."
"Apple",4,"i like this stuffs i think when you buy it you gonna love it like i did so only thing is price and shipping, if they fix it, i will be more happy next time."
"Apple",4,"We are military and it is extremely difficult to get companies to send iPhones overseas. This company provided that service and had it to us in Belgium in about a week. The phone was as described. However, the volume is very low and makes it difficult to hear any kind of ringtones, alert, etc.... I will contact the company and see about possibly replacing this one."
"Apple",3,"The battery does not work good. It does not work for more than 3 hours. The other things are ok."
"Apple",1,"The phones when delivered to me were in good condition. But when I gifted them to my friends, it was my worst nightmare. They were complaining that the display colors changed to some odd colors. The speakers of these were gone in some time. I would not recommend any one to buy form this seller."
"Apple",4,"Had a little issue at first but once that was sorted out, it worked fine, Good phone for a decent price, had no problems with it. would recommend."
"Apple",5,"iphone arrived quickly completely new along with the headphones and charger.just like it was described in the ad.I am extremely satisfied with this purchase."
"Apple",3,"It was in good condition but it didn't have the usb charger i was hoping for but overall it's nice. (Since I'm a first time apple user)"
"Apple",5,"So far so good... windows must be clean first"
"Apple",4,"good"
"Apple",5,"Nice very in time"
"Apple",5,"great phone works perfectly"
"Apple",5,"The phone is great, unfortunately the charger/cable is not functioning properly. It all appears to be original packaging, but it's hard to tell for sure. Still an awesome phone."
"Apple",5,"Outstanding my son loves the phone thank u I will buy again"
"Apple",5,"very good product recommend"
"Apple",1,"its not unlocked and didn't work"
"Apple",5,"Sent it to my niece in Africa and she loves it"
"Apple",5,"Great Phone but cannot install Skype. Voxox is better than Skype, and this phone can run Voxox!"
"Apple",4,"Great phone. I use it instead of iPod, b/c I need multiples in my office and iPods are $199.I just need Pandora and another app. to run music in my officeIt's a little slow and you can't get the latest software, otherwise for the price it's a good phone and I bought 3 of them."
"Apple",5,"delivered expectations"
"Apple",5,"I SENT THE PHONE TO GUYANA AND IT WORKED VERY WELL"
"Apple",5,"excellent choice"
"Apple",5,"Exelente"
"Apple",5,"Perfect . happy with the product .."
"Apple",4,"Great phone for under $60 bucks. Software updates is limited to 6.0, so limited to basic apps downloads."
"Apple",5,"Very satisfied with every aspect of the purchase including the sellers customer service."
"Apple",1,"Didn't work. Screen was blank. Disappointing"
"Apple",2,"I purchased these 2 iPhone 3GS, but they have the Cydia software on them...which means they are JailBroken and not Factory Unlocked. I purchased 3 phones in all. They look new, but I know they have been jailbroken b/c it won't show my the iOS version on the phone. Hmmmm"
"Apple",3,"I have had some problems with this phone but, in general, it is in good conditions. I recommend every body to contact the seller first before buying to ensure the full functionality of your future device. The devices, they are selling, are used but they have to be able to do all their operations. With the money I expended to repair my device, I could have bought a new one."
"Apple",4,"The Phone is brilliant for the money you are paying. The voice clarity and everything looks good. The only problem is that the headsets are totally waste and had to buy a new one."
"Apple",5,"The phone works great and have had no issues at all. I connected the phone with ATT and will test it in D.R. On my next trip. I believe that Claro will be my choice in D.R. Since Orange operates on a different band which will only give me 2G, but Claro should be able to provide me with 3G according to the specs, but so far, the phone works great. Factory unlocked."
"Apple",1,"I used the iPhone for today's , and i can not hear . The headphones work fine , and also the speaker phone . I asked a phone technician and he said something is wrong with the phone . The problem is that I am in israel with the phone until June 30.What shall I do?Dr David naveh"
"Apple",4,"good AfternoonestimatesPure mobilitybecause my Apple iPhone 3GS 8GB Black Factory Unlocked / Not Jailbroken) of Order # 103-4118021-3192220, software update asked me and lock me IME does not recognize the sim lost me indicate that the release and as team I distribute at & t can not be unlocked, I would like to give me your feedback as I use it in Venezuela.Mail CarlosGolosina@hotmail.com"
"Apple",4,"I received my phone when expected and was very happy with it. I enjoy all it can do and it does it well. I would recommend this company to anyone looking to get a very good phone for a good price. If there had been a charger with it it would've been perfect . but I knew it didn't come with one when I ordered it so it was no surprise. But in all I am very happy with my purchase . Thank you , Mobile spree."
"Apple",4,"The phone is working great, my husband likes it. Never had an apple phone before, even if it's the older model it works good."
"Apple",1,"I received the phone not in the original box. Definitely it is not genuine. It stopped working after ten days of really careful use. It does not receive a signal no more. I wish I had not bought it from this supplier. Do not buy it or you would be disappointed."
"Apple",3,"As the it says, it came factory unlocked, however, it's been the iphone that has died faster among all I have had so far (4). It lasted only 3 months of normal use. I wouldn't recommend it since I have to buy a new one after three months."
"Apple",5,"I loved this phone it works perfectly no scrashes or finger prints but I do have a little trouble with the battery all though great apple phone!"
"Apple",1,"The iPhone was claimed to be new and unopened. Yet, the iPhone was visibly used. The screen was very dirty and the edges were crusted with dirt. There was no charger with it and the quality of the entire purchase was very poor. I bought an iPhone with them before and it was fine, yet the following iPhones were very bad. They don't even deserve to be claimed as iPhones!!DO NOT PURCHASE ANY PHONES WITH THEM!!!!!!!!It is not even worth returning."
"Apple",1,"After using the phone for two weeks, the home button is not working anymore and when you plugged into the power cable is not charging.A little expensive for a two weeks cell phone."
"Apple",3,"It is what you get for this money. It is only 3g capable. This is my first Apple Phone and till now I am pretty satisfied with it."
"Apple",1,"I have got two Iphones. None of them are working fine. Battering is very weak. Am unable to return it as it is one month old."
"Apple",1,"review for my Dad. He bought this: This phone lasted only 4 months. the battery would not hold a charge for very long after that. replaced the battery with a replacement kit and now the phone does not work at all. the person that did it has done it before and did it for his own iphone and it worked fine. i would not buy this again from this seller. and now i cannot return it because you only had 30 days to do it! there comes a time when buying an entire new phone every 2 or 3 years because the battery dies and you can't change it easily like ALL OTHER PHONES ON THE PLANET EXCEPT IPHONE, you need to switch smart phones. This is for my Dad, not me. He won't stop buying iphones. Waste of money and an inherently immoral company that knows you will buy a new phone because you are an addict to brand consumerism."
"Apple",1,"Don't buy, the camera does not work, went to apple store and they don't even fix 3GS camera. So I got stuck with it."
"Apple",1,"Don't buy this phone. You will not be able to use it anywhere on this planet. Again, this phone is locked to a specific carrier. I wanted to have another iPhone for my travels. This phone is no use to me. I am happy that I checked it before going on my trip. I am certainly returning it."
"Apple",5,"Everything went completely well with this order. I am beyond satisfied, I recommend these guys one hundred percent sure. xoxo"
"Apple",5,"Got this for my grand daughter , she really does like it , she started using it imediatly , Thank you ."
"Apple",1,"I got a locked phone when I called they said oh sorry we knew there were problems with it but we sent it anyway. WTF? Now they keep removing my neg post and ask me to re evaluate the sale. Really?"
"Apple",1,"The item I purchased was listed as ""NEW"" under product condition. It was through a third-party vendor -- ROSS CELLULAR -- but fulfillment was completed by Amazon.com with Amazon Prime availability.The item arrived a few day late, but this was due to a federal holiday (MLK Day) that added two extra days to delivery time.Upon inspecting the item, I quickly discovered that:-- box was not an original box at all. It appeared to have dents on the corners, and it had clearly been opened before.-- phone itself appeared used. There was a plastic wrapping taped around the phone. It was removable, but the adhesive on the wrapping left traces on the device that required some cleaning up afterwards.-- contacted Apple and verified that the device has already been in use since 2011, meaning that Ross Cellular has sold me a USED device despite originally listing it as NEW.** Very disappointed** Please re-consider any future purchases from vendor Ross Cellular"
"Apple",1,"It work for a month, I went to the apple store they told me it could not be fixed; I bought another phone from them."
"Apple",5,"I ordered my used iPhone from amazon warehouse. I was hesitant because I didn't know what to expect although this was my second order from the warehouse. The IPhone came on time and by far it exceeded my expectations. It looked brand new, no marks or scratches, was in the original box & all the accessories. I was able to validate it through Apple and update to IOS6. I am very happy I got my iPhone at a very discounted price. Thanks to all the hard workers at Amazon warehouse in Lexington, Kentucky"
"Apple",5,"I like the phone very much. Its is working fine and I am planning to buy 1 more. Its a good deal."
"Apple",4,"when wife is happy, everybody happy, can't say the same thing about the arriss motorola i bought from kumbee inc. Unit sucks, will be sending back. Can't win em all"
"Apple",5,"The telephone appeared to be newThe phone works great , our sim was easy to install ( transfer )and we are happy"
"Apple",1,"I got the phone which is damaged the screen has some fault when I showed to apple store they said tht the phone has been tampered and us refurbished"
"Apple",5,"I ordered a used iphone and it came on time, unlocked, updated, and in the exact condition that was listed. I have not had any issues with this phone. Compared to the price of other new or used iphones, this is a great buy. I would buy from this seller again."
"Apple",1,"The phone does not charge properly and it seems like a use oneAlso, the phone looks like a fake one. the box seems fake too."
"Apple",5,"Works great"
"Apple",5,"I just wish I would have bought a front view camera. Yet over all I like them."
"Apple",3,"One of the speakers didn't work & I think it said jailbroken but it wasn't."
"Apple",5,"One month using it and rolls very good"
"Apple",5,"excelent"
"Apple",4,"the phone is working good i love dis iphone just put in my sim card an thats it working great im in trinidad and tobago and i have no problam i love it"

"Apple",5,"very goog"
"Apple",5,"good"
"Apple",5,"Because I have a work cell phone, I wanted an inexpensive way to have unlimited talk/text on a brother no your own phone plan. This is a new (or highly refurbished) iPhone that works fantastic. Very happy with it."
"Apple",3,"good team but it arrives damaged charger"
"Apple",5,"Good seller. Thank you ! A++++++"

"Apple",1,"It's garbage white screen doesn't want to turn on only lasted 2-months not worth $80. I only used it for calling and messaging"
"Apple",3,"was ok"
"Apple",1,"I paid 135 for this phone and when i received it i had to pay another hundred bucks to fix the screen and unlock it---------do not recomend"
"Apple",5,"Great product. Works 100%. Costumer's support is outstanding. The item arrived on schedule in perfect conditions. Congratulations to the company."
"Apple",4,"Good price for an entry level iPhone. Fast, reliable. Works with T-mobile sim. I pre pay 35$/month. Unlimited data.Cool."
"Apple",2,"The phone came with no scratches or anything but you could tell its used but I knew that when I ordered it. What I did not know was that the power button or volume up bottons did not work at all or that I wasn't going to receive everything in the picture of the item. It only came with the wall plub (no usb adaptor) and when I bought the usb adaptor, the wall plug did not work. There was no box, headphones, or charger. It did come unlocked though which worked out perfectly with straighttalk wireless. I am currently using the assistive touch button to make the phone work and basically if it dies when I'm not near a computer with my adaptor that I purchased I'm screwed."
"Apple",1,"I am expecting that it will be shipped soon. I am worried about the experiences and issues posted on the review pages by other customers. I wish mine will be good so far"
"Apple",5,"I use it with my existing pay-as-you-go SIM card and it is perfect! Skype calls with camera (not face time), Netflix, Angry birds, cloud storage, are few of its capabilities."
"Apple",5,"Knowing that this phone its actualy very old in the market, i love it, its gorgeous!!! I want to start to used"
"Apple",4,"Phone is unlocked, SIM card works withou any problem. Overall condition is good. Very little scratches on the phone, front and back."
"Apple",5,"Nice iphone 3gs for a good price. In good conditions and ready to use and it is unlocked you can use it in any cellphone company"
"Apple",2,"This product did not have a plastic module that holds the SIM card. It was not sealed and had scratches at corners.I was disappointed by this company."
"Apple",5,"It's factory unlocked, GSM and works well. A good option for your younger brother, girlfriend, whomever...Came in the original box, complete."
"Apple",5,"I ordered a used iphone and it came on time, unlocked, updated, and in the exact condition that was listed. I have not had any issues with this phone. Compared to the price of other new or used iphones, this is a great buy. I would buy from this seller again."
"Apple",5,"It is really brand new factory unlocked Iphone 3GS and no issues at all. It is nice and great phone."
"Apple",2,"I was surprised to notice that I still need to have the phone restored before using it. I paid 70 $ to have it restored or ''unlocked'' ( according to the specialist words). The battery is not good, I need to charge twice a day even though I have not used it. I would not recommend anybody to buy it."
"Apple",3,"I bought 2 sets one is ok but another one is not working properly the slide s not working,the keyboard is not working properly"
"Apple",5,"This is my first smart phone and I'm very pleased! Was able to exchange the phone promptly when the (ear) receiver was not operating. I recommend this seller who was helpful and very receptive."
"Apple",5,"Good condition phone! 3GS - very good model- has no problems at all! Thanks"
"Apple",3,"the phone i ordered was unlock but what came to me was locked. it did not serve the purpose for which i ordered it"
"Apple",1,"Mine came in broken with the screen popped off and I had to throw it away after 1 day"
"Apple",5,"even now it feels fantastic in a hand. great phone"
"Apple",5,"Excellent replacement phone."
"Apple",1,"worst seller to to but from the phone never work it keep coming on for 5 min then cut off and when i contact the sell they say ( sometime it unfortunatly it happen to you but sometime it may have a bad battery and we cant do anything about it sorry .) they will loose more than i did in the furter"
"Apple",5,"looks great"
"Apple",1,"I bought it a long time a go a 3GS IPHONE as an unlocked but it was locked and I could never unlock that. I just put it in trash can."
"Apple",5,"Came like a new phone (box, charger, instuctions, ear buds, tool) looked excellent and had no problem with it working except home button was a little sticky, wont complain very pleased for the price."
"Apple",1,"three days ago to remove the bad rate hoping that I would solve the problem. the phone is useless. also not up service button from the main panel does not work. was a Christmas present and I was forced to give my personal iphone. not want to call. free to contact me via email as any salesman. I am very upset because I feel ripped off and not take away this rate until you have the product under the conditions in which it was purchased. I also lined in this shell. used is not very good is used acceptable, if the problem can not solve my money back."
"Apple",1,"I 'd like to ask how should we do to fix my iphone, came with some problem, it;s not working properly.What i have to do to have it fixed??ThanksMIroel"
"Apple",5,"I've owned a Iphone 3gs before but it feel in a bucket of water. I wanted an iphone but I did not wanted the 4 or the 5. In my opinion the 3g and 3gs were the best built models. The product arrived before the estimated date, it was unlocked and the quality looked (and works) like new."
"Apple",5,"I have tried to return this phone but I can not get any information on how or where to return it, it does not work for me and Verizon Wireless will not make it ready for me to use. I have put in a claim as instructed by Amazon but still have not gotten a reply. The apple phone is too old orjust not usable....I desparately need help with this I need to return it so that my credit card can be credited and I will buy a new one that my carrier Verizon Wireless will accept....MY FRIENDS ARE LAUGHING AT ME FOR GETTING SUCH A BAD DEAL ON MY FIRST ATTEMPT AT SHOPPING ON AMAZON..."
"Apple",2,"It was very good but some of the keys are not working, so i was constrained to send it back."
"Apple",1,"this is an untruthful sellerthe first iphone he sent me, the front button won't work. said with charger but nothing.contact ...sent charger, but can't be used !sent another iphone. But battery die every 40 minutes talk !I give up. I throw $144 to the dirt.don't buy anything from this seller"
"Apple",2,"These Iphones arrived with batteries that only lasted 20 mins. I was forced to buy new replacement batteries. Not as advertised."
"Apple",5,"I got this phone for my mom , and she loves it she still is new to the iphone .. we are showing her step by step how to use different Apps on the phone but other than that she likes it and its UNLOCKED !!!!!!"
"Apple",1,"Crappy phone, completely lied, Not Jailbroken! Was told by 2 different cellular carriers they couldn't do anything with the phone! Complete waste of my money worst purchase to date from Amazon!"
"Apple",5,"The unlocked 3GS is a great phone. The remarkable thing is that there was no programming involved whatsoever when I put in my Simple Mobile (T-Mobile) chip. Calls, texts and internet work fine right from the get-go."
"Apple",4,"I love my new iPhone. It's just like an iPod except that I can make phone calls with it. Unfortunately, the charger didn't work and I had to use my iPod charger to charge the phone. I like the fact that it's unlocked because I can use it when I travel to Europe."
"Apple",1,"The device sent by this merchant to me did not work. It did not charge even leaving it plugged in for more than 24 hours. On top of all that, the device failed to activate."
"Apple",3,"compared to my htc sensation (yes I know that phone is wayy advanced and the comparison would be unfair) which I destroyed by getting it wet, of course it*s hard for me to give the Iphone 3s a fair review.However, here my review:The Iphone 3 is pretty and has most things you would need in a smart phone.I like the texting, even though sometimes texts especially pictures won*t send and I have to send it over and over- despite having service in the area!service..... yes, sometimes there is no service in an area for no reason. kind of annoying. I always had service with my htc so it is not my service provider. My friend who has the Iphone3 says the same thing.. very annoying.I was spoiled by having a gps tell me when to turn - the iphone 3 comes with a navigation system which is a lifesaver so and so often - but you still have to flip thru the steps manually as you go which can get you a ticket or killed at times.Some of the apps I could get for free for Android I have to pay for now.. bummer.The camera is terrible sadly, no flash, and no front screen camera..However, the phone works, it*s pretty, and if you use your phone mainly for calling and texting and only need the internet at times it works very well. I love the way the voicemails are set up!!!I don*t understand btw why apple makes the front screen from glass! I could drop my htc on concrete ten times a day and not a scratch would be on the screen but now when my Iphone slips my grip I nearly have a heart attack!"
"Apple",4,"I never saw a review that indicated someone using the iPhone on Straight Talk but it does work on it.The iPhone arrived FACTORY UNLOCKED! So that was good. There are sites you can check to see if the iPhone is factory unlocked by inputting the MEID. I slipped in the SIM card and it works. The only thing is that the iPhone is a little beat up. You can tell that the screen was replaced cause they did not clean the under screen before applying the new screen and you can see dirt in it when looking at the screen in the light, which can be annoying.The iPhone works and battery is good. The quality is not the best and the phone was Factory Unlocked and works on Straight Talk."
"Apple",5,"Considering the cost of smartphones today, they are as expensive as laptops at 1/10th the size. I do not need the latest phones so my needs are not that essential, however, if you are looking for a great phone, the 3GS is it. The price I got it for was fantastic and I use it with the Straight Talk plan. Of course, the Iphone does do everything so I am very happy with the purchase. Thanks!"
"Apple",5,"It took me several years to persuade my husband to buy iPhone for himself. Finally, the price of this iPhone 3GS made a trick and for couple of weeks already he is a satisfied user.The phone came with all accessories, but the box and brochure were not original. So far it works perfectly, the battery keeps as it should and there are no problems with the use."
"Apple",4,"Easy to use, just love this phone. My first iPhone glad that it came with direction. My wife use this phone more than I do, she loves it also."
"Apple",1,"I was really excited to get my phone. From the very first charge it stopped and started charging. I did not send back, this was my 1st I-phone and I didn't know if this was something that just came with the territory. 2 months later, the phone won't take a charge. It's a brick and it's too late to get a refund.It now serves as a pretty paperweight.Don't get ripped off thinking your experience will be different, you are flipping a coin."
"Apple",4,"Product arrived as advertised...had USB wall plug and connector. Phone did not have most recent update, but easily accepted it. Arrived charged which was nice. No case or instructions, but the screen was immaculate and only very minor wear was shown on the back of the phone.Fired up immediately after installing my TMobile sim card in the tray. Good deal and great price."
"Apple",5,"I was afraid to purchase an iPhone 5 for my 11 year old but he needed the phone for safety. This iPhone 3 was in perfect condition and his friends all want one now. Easy to order and fast delivery with great price."
"Apple",2,"Although the description says ""Can be upgraded, factory unlocked for any GSM carrier"" AND again states ""ready to be used on any GSM carrier worldwide"". They need to put a disclaimer that says, ""Well... any GSM carrier EXCEPT Verizon Wireless"" because they can NOT be activated on Verizon wireless. The main reason, that I understand, is the mere fact that Verizon never had a 3g iPhone, so they don't have 3g SIM cards compatible with the iPhone and the 4g SIM cards they do have will not work in the iPhone 3gS. I tried my best to get the phone activated but it was just a huge waste of time. If you have Verizon, don't bother - it's not gonna work and its just going to cause you a huge headache.One the positive side, the phone itself was very nice. It appeared to be brand new, in the box with all the accessories. Although the USB cable is not Apple brand, the description does say it includes a 'compatible' USB cable. Everything else seems legit, it turned on and the screen was flawless and bright. Just disappointed I didn't do my research about the 3g/4g SIM card business.The seller, Better Deals FASTER, was very professional and understanding. I was able to return the phone and have my money refunded as soon as they received the phone back.Buyer Tip of the Day: do your HOMEWORK and know what your carrier can activate before you go around buying $200 phones!"
"Apple",1,"when the battery charge drops to 70% the phone is turned off, data cable does not work.The phone looks new."
"Apple",3,"Phone was unlocked, but didn't come in a box and there was no ear piece. Therefore not sure if it was new as it was advertised"
"Apple",5,"Fast shipping good condition itemIt was well packed and shipped in a timely manor .Going to use it in Europe so have not had the chance to see how it works, but it looks good."
"Apple",4,"it was just ok! The purchased was ONLY the phone! Not like the Picture with Accessories and BOX!No Box, No Accessories! Just PHONE!"
"Apple",5,"works good. you can bank on apple product though pricy. Limited with what you can personally do compare to android phone."
"Apple",3,"I'll get to the point. I bought the phone new. I had it only two days when the on/off button fell off. I can still turn it on and off by using my fingernail. The camera's picture quality for low light could be sharper. The box wasn't factory wrapped in plastic when it arrived (which was sooner than its estimated time) so I have to wonder if it really was new. So besides the two flaws it's still a nice phone."
"Apple",4,"Phone came 100% brand new ! everything in mint condition and was great 4 stars cause it came without a charger"
"Apple",4,"what a deal on an entry level Iphone, my wife is learning to be tech savy, without paying the high price for 5S"
"Apple",5,"I ordered it for other than myself, but I did ask for review. As the person said it is a great purchase and very satisfied with it. Came with the original boxing just like You buy it in an apple store personally. Perfect in every single way, especially the pricing."
"Apple",5,"the phone works well and was what was described in the adi have had no problems with the unit"
"Apple",3,"it had a few scratches in the back of the phonethe screen looked great, brand new.however the the plug in wall charger does not work and cannot make the phone chargehad to buy a iphone charger.overall its a good phone battery is great, i can do everything i want and it functions very well."
"Apple",5,"The phone was maintained very good as described. I tested for 3 weeks and all are working. Shipped very fast. I like the phone."
"Apple",5,"A good telephone in a good condition. Arrived quickly. Nice that it had a new charger and a protection for the screen. Thank you!"
"Apple",5,"It is very good and almost as good as new. The charger's cable was chewed by a dog, but I bought a new one and it's working."
"Apple",5,"Bought from UnlockedCellPhoneKings refurbished. Arrived fast, in excellent conditions, like new.Everything as expected, unlocked, and all original accesories (charger, manual, etc.) were included.Read reviews carefully, you can notice there are a lot of bad experiences with some vendors offering ""new"" devices.Know the vendor before buying."
"Apple",1,"I bought this iphone as ""new"" and when i received it i realized it was furbished and it did not work. I ask someone to help in this case."
"Apple",5,"I'm not too interested in having the latest technology I just wanted an iOS device that was a little more portable than my iPad 3 and I happened to be needing a new phone as well, so I decided to go with the iPhone 3GS. It was just as described by the seller, brand new, a great price, works well on iOS 6 and adequately runs all of the apps that I use frequently. Maybe later I will be tempted to update to a newer model but for now I am satisfied. Great product."
"Apple",5,"Product was brand new, and was factory unlocked I was able to upgrade the software and register it with apple like it so much I am buying a second handset for my fiancée only problem is that the price went up"
"Apple",5,"so far everything is great end up ""Happy"""
"Apple",4,"Works great"
"Apple",5,"great seller.phone new in factory box"
"Apple",5,"Great"
"Apple",5,"perfect gift"
"Apple",5,"Kids loved them"

"Apple",5,"Excellent."
"Apple",1,"was lost"
"Apple",5,"I needed an unlocked 3gs iPhone to use with my T-Mobile account. This phone came in an Apple box, never been used or repaired. I checked out many sites before I settled on this seller and I'm glad I did."
"Apple",4,"Nice phone, great value, I was looking for an iphone, but didnt want to pay $300 or $400 for a newer version, so I went with this 3gs. It arrived in like new condition with all the features of the iphone for a much more affordable price."
"Apple",1,"No recomiendo este vendedor, sus equipos son reconstruidos, el mio vino con problemas en la pantalla y estoy en venezuela es dificil que se me repare el daño!!!"
"Apple",4,"I do not know where Tablet Distributors got these 3GS Iphones (mine came with 2010 manufacturing date) in almost impeccable condition - but it is true. Unlocked, in a new factory box. The only tell that it was ""in hands"" is that the supplied USB cord was actually for 4 version, and would not charge 3GS. No big deal - there are plenty of old cables around. 4 stars for that, but $237 deal is sweet. The same phone in Target would cost $150 more.It will work with almost any carrier except probably Verizon (I use cheap $30 T-mobile 5 GB plan, no contract and no activation fee). Be aware that 3GS Iphone uses normal, not mini SIM card. Mini SIM would work, but with the adapter."
"Apple",5,"todo perfecto como lo describianlo recomiendo.. sigan asi..todo perfecto como lo describianlo recomiendo.. sigan asi.. mejor imposibletodo perfecto como lo describianlo recomiendo.. sigan asi..todo perfecto como lo describianlo recomiendo.. sigan asi.. mejor imposible"
"Apple",5,"The iphone is the same that the seller discribe. Is new, and work perfect.I recomend this product for all people who wants to have an iphone and don't want to pay to much por a cel phone."
"Apple",5,"Apple is as apple does....thank God! :-) love this phone! It works perfectly, was unlocked and came with clear instructions about how to connect to the iStore, etc. Love it. Mine was white, not black as pictured. I didnt care because it's covered anyway. But if you do care, you may want to make sure. Also, mine is slightly cracked, the shell on back, close to the charging inut. Does NOT interfere with operations but just FYI. I've chosen to keep it because it works perfectly. Arrived when expected. Good value for the price."
"Apple",1,"I bought a phone and they sent me a damage one. Not recommended. I hate it completely. Not good at all."
"Apple",4,"It's perfect, factory unlocked.Works well in Brazil.I already updated and no problem at all.Apple products are great."
"Apple",5,"Great working order. Came packaged safely and wasn't moving around in the box. Was shipped out immediately. Greatly appreciated. Thanks."
"Apple",5,"Love my new IPhone, so easy to use, great price"
"Apple",4,"A very good price for what you are getting. It's not the best phone out there and it's a little slow, but if you're only looking for a cheap smartphone to talk and text on, this is is the phone for you."
"Apple",5,"Exactly as described"
"Apple",5,"Basic use for calls and texting. Works great."
"Apple",5,"Looks almost new. Started working as soon as SIM was inserted."
"Apple",1,"dose not work with verizon but every nice people"
"Apple",5,"Very happy with my iphone 3GS. I got a great price. I took it to at&t and they set it up for me in 15 minutes."
"Apple",5,"it's working perfectly!"
"Apple",5,"Very Happy"
"Apple",1,"Too good to be true. When I received this phone (fulfilled by Amazon), it looked new. It was sealed. But upon using it, it's obviously refurbished??? It wouldn't read my wi-fi and sim card. Also it keeps shutting off on its own even when it's fully charged. The browser freezes a lot as well. Beware."
"Apple",1,"When the phone stopped charging I went to check the serial number in the SIM tray. For my surprise the SIM tray did not have any serial number as is should.Then I checked the SN on the box that came with the phone. I went to the apple site to check the warranty and got the following message?""We're sorry, but this is a serial number for a product that has been replaced. Please check your information and re-enter your serial number. If your information is correct, you may need to contact us.""After that I went to check the backup of it on my computer and discovered that the Serial Number did not match with the one on the box and worse than that the apple site tells me that there is no more warranty for this serial number.Now, I have a new iPhone that does not work and does not have warranty. If I have to pay the 150 dolars to have it fixed, it means that I could have bougth a iPhone 4s instead.This is the first time I have problems whe buying on Amazon. I hope there is a way to solve this situation."
"Apple",3,"Well is a old model and they work just fine no complain about it the price was good son no complain"
"Apple",4,"looks brand new with retail packaging (as shown in the picture) ...wifi got disconnected couple of times but issue solved after rebooting the phone...hope its not an issue..other than that no issues with the phone so far...."
"Apple",5,"My mother (late 50's) asked me to get her an old style Nokia or Samsung (no touch screen). She just uses the phone to make/receive calls.Spending around 60$ more, i decided to get her this unlocked iphone 3GS 8GB. (This phone is unlocked and runs IOS6 and we are using it abroad). I was surprised that she adapted fast to the iphone interface and started sending messages for us via Watsapa and calling us daily via Skype. In addition, she is taking and sending pictures.This is not the iphone 5 (not very high screen resolution, not powerful memory and processor). But it can run all the apps that the new iphone run and you can save around 500$. It is a great value for the money and I highly recommend it if you are on a limited budget."
"Apple",4,"it is a perfect phone for me. I realy like it I am using it for almost a month now i dont have a problem."
"Apple",4,"I wanted an iPhone and not really bothered about latest technology.... This little guy works great.. at a great price.. runs iOS 6 and its unlocked phone!! It was activated and working in first try and it was easy... I just needed to insert valid SIM before it can be activated (It wouldn't be activated on WiFi only without SIM card).. It was arrived on time."
"Apple",1,"The phone needed repair after 15 days, cost me $90.00 and then the battery needed to replaced 7 days after that.The phone was not new as claimed. This has been a horror story."
"Apple",5,"Excellent condition.Just what my grandson wanted.In box with cord, right color.New condition.and easy to add apps and use to potential."
"Apple",5,"I bought this phone for my sister as a replacement for her older 3GS that quit working. She has limited funds so newer model iPhones were not possible and past problems with used phones made that not an option. The 3GS is a dinosaur but it still has great features and is very easy for almost anyone to use. The iPhone 3GS purchased from Tablet Distributors and fulfilled by Amazon was as described, new and unlocked. It came in the original packaging with wall charger and headphones. I do not think the wall charger provided works but the old one is fine so I don't care. I upgraded to the latest iOS, restored contacts, and connected to Straight Talk without problems. Very happy with this purchase."
"Apple",1,"I bought this IPhone as a gift to my mother in law, she told me it was working good, now that 4 years later, she moved in with me and asked me to buy another IPhone for her, but she now insist on buying a new IPhone, I asked why, she hesitantly told me that the last used IPhone I bought her (from this seller) didn't work well, the Home button didn't work,...but she didn't want to hurt my feeling so keeping this secret until now. I had given a 5 stars in the past but now I know the truth, I am downgraded to 1 star, I am so pissed."
"Apple",1,"Item had some dents and very visible wear, was not ""New"" as described in the listing, that is incredible for the price that I pay! i go to return this item!"
"Apple",5,"Arrived quickly, works absolutely fine."
"Apple",3,"Good iPhone but not what i'm looking for"
"Apple",1,"friends shari the phone you buy is used and then restored is not new battery does not last long and I connect it to charge the battery and after 10 or 15 min loads the cel and deconectarlo low battery 70 or 80 % of a ud once again publish the phone is not new and should not publish again I feel cheated by this situation"
"Apple",5,"this was worth every penny"
"Apple",5,"I bought this phone for my 14-years old son. I wanted an iPhone, but not paying for it. So this 3GS was perfect and cost me a fraction of the iPhone 5."
"Apple",1,"I am not satisfied with phone,As it's not working properly and displaying screen was not good.Poor co lour display.Less quality."
"Apple",5,"100% reliable recommend thanks for everything"
"Apple",3,"Good"
"Apple",5,"Everything was as promised and expected."
"Apple",3,"I ordered this for my mother and it had no sim card slot. I had to buy it and have it shipped. It doesn't say anything about this in the description of the product."
"Apple",1,"The charger did not work, there was a huge scratch on the screen, and a even bigger crack by the charging port. Would have pasted with so many issue if they would have been explained in detail. Shipping was fast and timely so that's why I'm posting review"
"Apple",5,"The phone came quickly and met all of my expectations. After a month, it has worked flawlessly and done everything I needed. Good seller and good product!"
"Apple",1,"Why is it so difficult for the vendor to provide a product as specified on Amzn? This product was not factory unlocked and my T-Mobile SIM card did not get any signal on this phone, whereas it got a full signal on my Google phone."
"Apple",5,"The phone works fine and as soon as I inserted the SIM card. Also, I appreciate your thank you card."
"Apple",5,"excellent product"
"Apple",5,"Nothing better you can get for the price and the appearance. I really would recommend to anyone looking for a smartphone to test drive an older iphone first to see how they like it. It's a cheaper test run and it's fully functional. I would recommend this to anyone"
"Apple",5,"Even if already has a newer version of iPhone, the 3GS still a good purchase, everything works fine, good for our kids."
"Apple",5,"Love the phone and got a great price for it. Good for anyone who's looking for a nice cheap and useful smartphone for everyday use. Using for the tmobile line. works great"
"Apple",1,"This product looks great! but it not work as expected, sometimes it restart itself without any cause, when i receive calls I cannot hear the caller's voice, the same occurs when i make calls, no body can hear me.If you ask me if i would purchase this or another used product from this vendor. My answer is NOT, radically.With this product really feel that i lost my money."
"Apple",3,"It's ok"
"Apple",5,"Very happy with purchase, works great"
"Apple",5,"I bought this as a gift for my niece, she loved it (never had a smart phone before)what can I tell you, is an iPhone"
"Apple",5,"Good buy.. For an iPhone.. New!!"
"Apple",5,"good product"
"Apple",5,"Item as described and is unlocked not jailbroken as they have stated very satisfied with this iPhone 3GS 8GB bought it brand new Sheri international was very quick to ship it out and very well packed in the shipping box they use UPS very good delivery system to use when shipping or fedex both are very good company to use when shipping i have T-Mobile on prepaid service the iPhone 3GS was very easy to set up to it i had windows 8.1 nokia 521 which is ok but i like Apple Cell phone's better the transfer was very easy for it all u need is adapters to switch the cards out."
"Apple",1,"Got this phone for my parents Christmas gift. The home button spoiled in two days, can't use the phone because you can't come out of the last App. Unfortunately I'm not able to return the phone. Don't buy!"
"Apple",1,"I saw a lot of great reviews about this phone, and I thought I would be one of those lucky ones who wrote these great reviews. I was so excited to find out that the battery works fine yesterday. Unfortunately, this phone couldn't be activated in the store today. It doesn't recognize sim card; maybe it's a locked phone. It's been a waste of my time. I just want to break this phone right now, but I guess I should get my money back. It's not worth it. I bought it from ROSS CELLULAR, btw."
"Apple",5,"Son loved phone and I liked the price point. He needed phone for oversees to use while away from home.As of May 2015: Purchased in Dec. 2014, started using in Jan. 2015. No longer wish for the 5 stars, after 5 months of use this is the update on this phone: speakers making screeching noise, phone would freeze up, now pretty much not charging any longer. It served its purpose but lasted only 5 months. Too bad. (only used for text and online stuff, with a very occasional phone call)"
"Apple",5,"Phone was exactly what was described. Great shape, brand new. Not a scratch. Much more affordable than getting a newer iPhone, or a two year service contract."
"Apple",5,"muy bueno"
"Apple",4,"Very good service and phone working well."
"Apple",5,"Great phone. If you get a 3 make sure it's a 3gs. Nice rugged feel."
"Apple",4,"Got it as expected - unlocked, factory-sealed and in good working condition!"
"Apple",5,"My wife loves it. Works great. Thank you soon much."
"Apple",2,"very bad phone"
"Apple",4,"Still working and that is all that counts. :)"
"Apple",5,"Excellente"
"Apple",1,"Did not work as expected. GSM sim did not work on it even though it said unlocked smh"
"Apple",3,"Good"
"Apple",4,"This product is good, durable and seems to be exactly like described.My dad is using this phone and he is really happy with this."
"Apple",5,"The seller had this phone listed as used but in good condition.......the phone was actually in excellent condition. Much better than what I had expected it to look like. Arrived very quickly as well"
"Apple",5,"I really like it. works good and smooth. I bought it used. both of the were clean and in a very good condition. it came really fast on expedited shipping with a few bucks more. but it is worth the money i paid. I like it."
"Apple",5,"This is a great phone with a great price. The phone had virtually no scratches. It works well with my T-Mobile sim card. The phone was already updated to iOS 6 when I received it, so I only had to insert my sim to use it."
"Apple",1,"I had high hopes buying this phone but when it came it was a horrible situation - right away it developed problems. It just plain quit working inside of 3-4 weeks, the only one I give excellent high points to was Amazons return policies!! THANK YOU AMAZON."
"Apple",4,"Thanks but i think ill just stick to my old phone. I do enjoy the games but the phone locked up and i cant get ahold of this france SFR place to fix it. I wont be ordering any more iphones anymore. I do like it its just frozen up and i cant use it atm. Thanks again. I was impressed with the speedy delivery."
"Apple",5,"We had to send the iPhone back due to it not being compatible with the plan that my daughter had chosen, and the company was great, understanding and very helpful. I would recommend this company for sure!"
"Apple",1,"Seems to me that this phone was dropped several times and has significant wear and tear the hear phone jack is dented in. Very bad experience"
"Apple",2,"When I bought I chose it from the new phones option.I ordered a new, unlocked 3gs iPhone. This one won't work properly, I can't even do a restart on iTunes!"
"Apple",5,"This item surpassed my expectations. I could not tell that the iPhone was used. I needed an iPhone with the capabilities to support Square credit card reader. Works great and included recharging cable."
"Apple",2,"The charger that came with the phone doesn't charge the phone it says ""Charging isn't supported with this accessory."" At the bottom of the screen there is some discoloration and there are a lot of small/medium scratches. It was only $30 so I didn't expect much but the phone works fine and was unlocked like advertised and I was able to use it on my plan."
"Apple",1,"unfinished return"
"Apple",5,"In great shape for the age of it, had a crack in back and SIM tray was damaged but it's all perfect! Works like it should! Worth the price!"
"Apple",1,"The phone dies after 15 mins fully charged - NO KIDDING"
"Apple",5,"This turned out to be a NEW unused IPhone - it worked great right out of the box - lost mine when I left it for 5 minutes on a restaurant table."
"Apple",5,"I just didn't like it"
"Apple",5,"Nice phone !"
"Apple",2,"ok"
"Apple",5,"as described and works well"
"Apple",1,"I bought two of these phones. One of them worked fine, but the other decided to stop working about three months after I bought it. It wasn't charging so I bought a different charger and it still didn't work. When I called iTunes help center about an issue I had with the apps, when it was still working, I gave them the number inside the phone and they told me that the phone had been bought years ago, so it's DEFINITELY not new. I never would have bought it had I known it was used, refurbished, or whatever this was."
"Apple",5,"A++++fast"
"Apple",5,"all good"
"Apple",5,"It was excellent. thanks"
"Apple",5,"excellent phone ,excellent seller"
"Apple",1,"The item's charger did not work and it seems as though this is a fake or replica iPhone. I will have to take it to the Apple Store to know for sure but I'm unhappy with the product besides the fact that it took over two weeks to get here."
"Apple",5,"Great product works great"
"Apple",1,"it is not working.i like to return.. Very bad condition.it was not like i saw it in the add.it is totally garbage. i just trashed my money."
"Apple",5,"Perfect to use as ipod. Brand new."
"Apple",5,"Works great! Using it to help my grandma learn how to get up to date with technology!"
"Apple",1,"*** I GOT DUPLICATE IPHONE, AS SOON AS YOU GET THE PHONE PLEASE CHECK WHETHER IT IS ORIGINANL BY CALLING APPLE SUPPORT TO SAVE YOURSELF **** SELLER: WIRELESS MARKET""I bought the phone and it display gone bad within two months, and when I went to apple service center they checked the phone and said it is a duplicate product. And I said them that I got it from amazon. They said, they are facing many duplicate phone complaint from amazon purchases.I was further shocked!!!!I felt lonely and cheated by a big giant! I felt helpless. Depressed!!! It was a gift to my wife, and felt shame! felt insulted! Please be aware and save yourself.."
"Apple",1,"The phone described as new and it looked like new when it arrived. The home button was not working as new and few other problems and hence checked with apple with the IMEA. They clearly confirmed its a refurbished phone. So disappointed."
"Apple",5,"Love this phone. it arrived exactly as described and was factory unlocked and not at all jail broken (like my other phone from a cellular service provider). I could set up our new phone plan in about 10 minutes and it is fully up to date! I will recommend this seller to every one I know.Thanks again!"
"Apple",1,"Unfortunately the product did not meet my expectations. I could not update the version of IOS (was only in the number 4). This shows that the device was unlocked not in the way that appears in the ad. I had to pay a technical assistance that confirmed the problem. I would return it and get my money back. I bought two devices on two different dates and two had the same problem."
"Apple",1,"I bought this phone to replace one exactly like it since my started having problems. I was so excited when I received it; however, it will not import my contacts, capital letters do not work when you push the arrow key and will not even find my carrier. I am so disappointed in this particular purchase."
"Apple",5,"I was shopping for a replacement of 3GS after my daughter broke my phone. I was worried with some of the reviews after I placed the order. The Phone was in very good condition, unlocked, I just had to insert the SIM card and restore the backup from iCloud. I just had to spent 5 minutes to get going with this phone. I will certainly recommend this seller to my friends."
"Apple",1,"I ordered two ""New"" iPhones, what i received were refurbished phones. I was planning to gift it but.....Now I visited apple outlet and bought tow ""New"" iPhone 4s..."
"Apple",5,"Excellent service and easy to use. Would recommend this product to others. plan to use it for a long time"
"Apple",5,"iphone keeps an innovate desing, easy to operate, fast in internet an limited with some apps but iphone 3gs is still a good choosefor the price"
"Apple",1,"got it last month and it doesnt work any more ... i just cant tur it on .. when i connect it to the wall charger it turns on for a while and after a minute or two or if i unpluge it it dies ----- please need help if anybody knows how to fix it //// im in argentina and theres no apple store here.."
"Apple",5,"EL IPHONE ESTA CASI NUEVO ACTUALIZADO A LA VERSION EN OPTIMAS CONDICIONES OFERTA INMEJORABLE EN LA TIENDA EN LINEA Y CONTRAPARTE"
"Apple",1,"I buy one, but I was think it new but when I receive it I find that it look old and used and like be repaired"
"Apple",5,"Excellent product!"
"Apple",5,"I haven,try it yet. I will be using overseas and I am travelling in two days."
"Apple",5,"Works great"
"Apple",5,"very good iphone 3gs."
"Apple",2,"The speaker desnot work."
"Apple",5,"great"
"Apple",5,"Nice."
"Apple",5,"Nice phone as described great fast service"
"Apple",5,"thanks"
"Apple",1,"When I received the iphone,i found it is fake and inferior product,the back cover is renovated,the receiver has a noise when you have a call,screen light-leaking,in a word,it is a bad iphone."
"Apple",5,"Yes I like my 3G first I can't connect to Internet but finally I got it and I happy with my selection thank you very much"
"Apple",4,"Came in factory box unopened, my niece hasn't had one problem with it. Programmed so easy for her straight talk activation"
"Apple",5,"I was using a an old iPhone 3 that a friend gave me and got to really like it. But then I accidentally got a lot of water on it and couldn't get it to work again. I bought another cheap mobile phone and was very dissatisfied with it--I wanted my iPhone back! I thought to look for a used iPhone on Amazon and was delighted to find many 3Gs for sale for under $100.00. It works great so far and I'm happy with it."
"Apple",1,"I received the phone with the ""on"" button missing. I took it into the apple store and they said it was counterfeit and refused to fix it. I contacted the seller but they refused to do anything."
"Apple",5,"i got this phone as a gift for my nephew i have had iPhone 3gs before so i know how they work , the phone is in mint condition but did not come with a charger, the phone is factory unlocked as promised and did not ship in the amount of time that it should this is also understandable and acceptable once you use the phone for the first time."
"Apple",4,"WORKING NICE AS PER EXPECTATIONS STILL I DID NOT COME ACROSS ALL THE FEATURES IT CONTAINS .PICTURE QUALITY IS EXCEPTIONAL."
"Apple",1,"I have trouble with receiving pictures . had to call my cell phone company and Im still having trouble. Its just wasn't what I expected. I also ordered the plastic cover and I still waiting for it. it now been 3 weeks"
"Apple",4,"The only thing I don't like is that I can't receive pictures from other people. If I could do that it would be great."
"Apple",5,"I bought it for my 14 years old, great condition exactly as describedI'll always use the seller and recommend to all my friends, great price and fast shipperThank you"
"Apple",1,"I had purchased this as a replacement for a 3gs phone that I apparently used as a basketball too often. I had to return it because several features did not work. I subsequently ordered a 4s, an upgrade at a similar price which works fine."
"Apple",4,"I was skeptical about buying the unlock iPhone 3GS from Amazon after seeing the bad reviews, but I checked with the seller and went ahead and purchased it after he confirmed it. I gotta say, I'm very happy with this purchase. It wasn't hard to set up the sim's card into the device. It came in the mail like it was brand new with the original packaging and everything. I love texting and calling my friends and family with it. I have experienced the white screen of death, but I restarted it without a second thought and everything has been fine ever since. I haven't really experience any serious heating problems and I've played some high capacity games on it while being plugged in. It does get rather warm in the hands, but it wasn't enough to be uncomfortable for me. The main reason why I got this phone was because I wanted an easier and more convenient way to call and text my friends and family. The phone I had before was a flip phone without a proper keyboard. This does what I want and so much more. For $115, I got a really good deal and I'm happy to say that I'll be using this until my dad stops paying for the contract or it does die out on me. Just to let those who have flip phones know, the iPhone 3GS can PREVENT data being used when you're not on that plan. The flip phone that I had would take me onto the web without warning me first and that caused my phone to be charged a few extra dollars for just a few seconds of being on the internet. At least now, I don't have to worry about those slippages because I can only use data when i'm using wi-fi.I don't really have any complaints for this phone because it's more then what I want in an phone, but as an Apple product, I have to say that the screen really takes a miss. I'm so spoiled by Retina Display on my iPod Touch 5g, that it bugs me when everything is in low resolution. When comparing watching videos or pictures, it's just ain't the same. It's good when I'm bored at college, but for casual use, it's not that great from today's standards.It's a little bulky, but I kind of like it that way. It gives it a feel to it and it doesn't slip out of my hands unlike the new iPod Touch.Seeing that I got the white screen of death on the second day scared me. I'm hoping that wasn't the reason why the seller sold it to me.Summery:Pros:Great for a phone and great for texting.Has great cellular connection.Satisfying battery life.Can handle playing games without taking too much heat.Can prevent using data on cellular network unlike my old flip phone.Cons:Poor screen quality compared to today's standard for Apple products.Sort of bulky, but having some weight is a pro for me.White screen of death on the second day of using it."
"Apple",5,"The phone meets all my requirements and more.Was easy to set up with my Carrier ( AT&T)Lightning fast"
"Apple",1,"Well, the camera appeared to be broken and the phone itself is kinda slow. Not satisfied at all. Need to order another phone now."
"Apple",3,"the item was not had been as described, they said in good condition but when i received it has a big scratch at the back and has small crack at the charger port."
"Apple",5,"Love it love it !!! It is exactly what was advertised that I receive at the allotted time I was promised... Took it to AT&T store the transferred all my info except my music to my brand new iPhone 3GS I told all my friends to go to amazon for all their needs*******"
"Apple",5,"it arrived exactly as amazon said it would, the phone was in excellent condition and brand new as far as I could tell and works like a charm ... may not be the newest model but suits my needs to a tee for an excellent price."
"Apple",1,"This phone it was supposed to be brand new and when I receive it I realize the the phone was used the screen was replace and the phone charger had water damage sings so I'm not happy"
"Apple",1,"My daughter saved her money all year long to by her own iphone, and when we got it it wouldn't even power on. The battery wouldn't charge. We sent the phone back and they replaced the battery and we thought we were in good shape. Now the ringer switch is causing the phone to vibrate constantly, the speaker doesn't work anymore, and the headphones keep cutting out. We contacted them just over 30 days and now we're stuck with this POS!!!"
"Apple",1,"i observed it for a couple of weeks and i found out that every time i have a incoming calls and out going calls the phone is turning off and even the battery icon still in high percentage. i don't know what's wrong with this phone. can i return it and check what's the problem?"
"Apple",5,"I ordered this used iphone for my son instead of buying him a ipod. The price was better than that of a new ipod and he can use it on his cell phone plan. The phone came unlocked and as described. He is very happy with it."
"Apple",5,"It is a great phone. It can be used anywhere and it is easy to use the shipping was on time a great service"
"Apple",5,"It would be nicer if I had service in my home from Tmobile for this ;phone. Outside, it is great- not in my house."
"Apple",5,"This unlocked phone works great on T-Mobile. I just had to insert the SIM card from my old black-berry phone. Within a few minutes, it got signal. Because it was factory unlocked, it was updated to to iOS 6 just fine and remained unlocked afterward. Don't buy those iPhones that are unlocked by software, because you can't update iOS.My existing T-Mobile contract doesn't have a data plan. All I had to do was disabling 3G and Data from Settings > General > Cellular. After that Wi-Fi works fine and I don't have to pay for a data plan.Note that if you do a factory reset on the phone, the only way to get through the initial setup is either by having a data plan or activate via USB cable attached to a computer having iTune installed.The condition of the phone is dependent on who you buy it from. My copy was near perfect."
"Apple",1,"This was an AT&T phone with cheap accessories; Apple was spelled as Abble suggesting Middle East as the origin. It was defective; had signal problems, messages didn't go through. However, the seller (24.Hour.Shipping) was nice and issued a refund including return shipping. Thanks.Please, do NOT buy cell phones on the internet!"
"Apple",1,"The phone arrived on time and in perfect condition (brand new, factory packaged). Unfortunately, the phone was LOCKED.LOVE the iPhone, but item was NOT as described. It was described as Factory Unlocked / Not Jailbroken."
"Apple",5,"The iphone 3GS met all my expectations and went beyond. I was concerned about performance after upgrading it to the latest version of IOS, but I went ahead to do it anyway. It has performed well ever since."
"Apple",5,"Bought it for Europe"
"Apple",4,"good item"
"Apple",5,"Excelente"
"Apple",1,"Complete waste of money. Never worked right, constant freeze and lockout. Answering a call was too much for this phone to handle."
"Apple",1,"The battery swelled to the point that it almost exploded and ruined phone. Then the seller would not replace!!!!!"
"Apple",5,"Very goog"
"Apple",5,"received in great condition, works great on my cricket service"
"Apple",5,"I had heard so much negative comments about this phone. I asked if Whatsapp works on it, and one said nothing about this phone works. Well, I am here to say I found nothing wrong with this 3GS iPhone. It works perfectly and I'm loading apps like I dont care!!!! Good phone!"
"Apple",1,"the phone was locked i waste the money"
"Apple",2,"The phone looks good but cannot tell how it's work because the phone came with little charge and the charger came with it is not working......really disappointed."

"Apple",3,"I never used the phone. I ordered it and did not realize that I needed a SIM card adapter to make it work with my sim card. I ordered an adapter, but by the time I got it, my regular phone came back from repair. I charged it and it powered on, and it accesses all the apps already on the phone. I did not put my sim card in or use any of the apps (other that to that it accessed them). It looks to be in good shape with just a few superficial scratches."
"Apple",5,"great item, amazing item work perfect. thanks"
"Apple",2,"Although the phone came with no major flaws and appeared to be in working order the phone often shuts off randomly and won't turn back on unless I plug it in which has proven to be a large inconvinience. I probably won't be purchasing from this seller again"

I can't download any apps or do anything other then make calls, pictures and music. I can get online bit it won't hold any apps because Apple doesn't update the iPhone 3 anymore and it complete crap.

Additionally, reasoned that the battery is bulky, all the base card Cell Phone (circuitry) is damaged. Finally, the product was a total fiasco.

No scratches, looks like a brand new phone. the packaging makes me wanna get a another one even though I don't have money. Seriously, I have no draw backs for this product and its seller. I'll recommend this seller to any one..."
"Apple",1,"I had purchased this as a replacement for a 3gs phone that I apparently used as a basketball too often. I had to return it because several features did not work. I subsequently ordered a 4s, an upgrade at a similar price which works fine."
"Apple",1,"The iphone ran well the first month. Suddenly it didnt turn on anymore and I went to an Apple store to check what the problem is. They told me that all internal equipment is old and prepared to stop working after some weeks. I bought it as a new phone but now there is no way to repair it, only by changing all its interior. Sent a message to supplier for return the equipment but didnt hear any word back."
"Apple",1,"I bought one it works only one and have month then the mic does not work . I went to apple store they told me it out of guaranty it sold from apple since 2010 so I just loss my money"
"Apple",5,"This was gift, and I needed an older phone for T-mobile. As the person in question does not have a data plan, he turned off cellular\Data on the phone put in his SIM, and it worked like a champ"
"Apple",2,"The phone has many glitches, including but not limited to:Shutter on camera that will not openCamera does not take and capture photosWiFi does not recognized any familiar networksBattery extremely weak, charge runs out within 3 hours with occasional usageOther than that the phone is great for email,web browsing, Facebook, etc."
"Apple",1,"Please guys NEVER buy from this saler I was very disappointed when I bought a new iPhone 3 gs from , got some problem and Square Trade told me that it was a refurbished one, it was not new. I will never , never and ever get anything from him again"
"Apple",5,"The phone works great. Just like advertised. No issues with installing apps, setting it up. We use it for straight talk."
"Apple",1,"I bought this iPhone 3gs for my son only work for 4 months then was shutting off when had 60% of battery i talk to couple friends told me it was something i the ios software because battery was showing 60% but i found an apple community website saying they replaced the battery an work ok . I did replaced the battery my self an found inside the iPhone was missing screws an the clip to hold the camera in place . its not good because you are paying for new iPhone an i got a used repair phone has been 1 week after i replaced the battery seems to be working ok but i don't recommend this seller to any body save your self a headed."
"Apple",5,"Got it for Christmas early! So glad it came in.The phone is just as described and it's great :)"
"Apple",4,"I would take the Apple iPhone 3GS over the Samsung G3...I would recommend to friends and family members....A+ product that has exceeded my expectations."
"Apple",5,"awesome product. my daughter loved it and opened it right away. she couldnt wait til xmas. thank you. she's in mexico"
"Apple",1,"I ordered a WORKING 3GS, and it came with a non-working mic. He blamed it on the USPS, and offered to fix it for free, but I could tell that the silver layer attached to the back cover was a bit off, so I took it to a local shop that knows who I am. I have a nose for when things don't smell right. They looked at it for free. The back cover was ghetto rigged on in a manner that the screen came out too easily, and that when a new mic was inserted, the home button would not work anymore. 607 Tech Solutions is the highest rated Tech Repair shop in Broome County, NY. They are professionals, and took the phone apart and put it back together three separate times with three new mics. I watched take an hour to do something that should have taken ten minutes on a normal device. He did not charge me, and told me to send the product back."
"Apple",5,"Phone arrived as scheduled. Phone looks new n works well. The info posted was accurate. I put my Tmobile in n it works n it is ready to go for now. No problem. Nice company. Can be trusted."
"Apple",3,"Works well with T Mobile. The screen is a little small which can cause eye fatigue. Overall, it does an adequate job with wifi."
"Apple",5,"I love this phone. The only thing I don't like is the battery doesn't seem to stay charged as long as my last one."
"Apple",5,"Brand new and performs efficiently, it is as said, factory unlocked allows me to use it in my region without any complications at all"
"Apple",3,"So bought this iPhone 3GS the only thing that sucked was the home button it was had to push deeper glass had some scratches but it was still worked great glass it did not have any glass cracks before had iPod touch 4g do not see much slowness but my power button on iPod touch got stuck so this why i got a iPhone also needed a phone"
"Apple",5,"I am very satisfied with this phone. It was cheap and is the earliest iPhone model that can update to iOS 6. I bought it for a family member who is not very technology savvy and it was easy to teach him how to use it. It has all the functions of a smart phone without becoming too fancy or complicated. He was able to use a T-Mobile sim card on this phone with no problems."
"Apple",4,"I like this phone very much! It meets all my needs, taking picture, surfing the net, knowing the weather and downloading some interesting software. The price is also very good! The reason I did not give a five star is not because of this phone but because of the seller's service. Although they have returning policy but with some condition, for example you have to pay some money for that. I bought a iphone 3 before this one from this same seller. I didn't know I could not purchase software from apple store with iphone 3 until i received it. But if I returned it, i had to pay the mail fees and the about 15% (?) of the price to the seller. Anyway, if the seller could better the service, it will be perfect."
"Apple",2,"Once the phone came I was excited and thought I had a real good deal that was until the phone died, I tried to recharge the phone for hours on hours with no luck. I contact the seller and returned the item now this is were thing got shady. I was told my the seller that my refund would be back on my card 3 to 4 hours, I contacted the sell in 5 hours and was told it take 3 to 4 days, after the days when by No Refund, I tired one more time with the sell who told me that he put the money back on my card that day.... Never Happen!!! It took me one month to get my money back. BE CAREFUL"
"Apple",2,"very fine product, its works perfectly, is exactly were i spected good conditions very weel nice deal thanks you at all butthe battery was damage in the trip"
"Apple",4,"bought this phone for my husband. Works fine for talk, texting and music. Has had some trouble with the volume going up on it own when listing to music, but for the most part, good phone for the money."
"Apple",1,"Unusable, cellphone always gets a terrible reception, even on areas where everyone else has perfect signal. i'm not satisfy with the product."
"Apple",5,"I needed two phones for my twins who were turning 12. I wanted them to have something nice but reasonably priced. Of course they wanted iPhones. I'm not going to buy a 12 yr.old a $500 phone for their first phone plus I needed two. So I figured the 3GS would be perfect. I ordered two from somewhere else and only one came unlocked. I was in a panic there birthday was in 3 days! So I found y'all and got the phone I wanted and just in time for their bday!! Thank you for getting me my order on time and thank you for getting me what I wanted a UNLOCKED phone!! My kids love their new phones!!"
"Apple",1,"I have purchased new i phone 3gs from this wireless provider as a gift to my friend and latter realised its not working.The worst part even if you report this the wireless provider would n't care for replacing the device or refunding your money.Shows 100% functional on the web site --its a lie."
"Apple",5,"A very well made smart phone. Easy to use. Although an older version (iPhones are now version 5), the manufacturer provides software updates."
"Apple",4,"i got the phone but it was the wrong one i order and 16 gb but got a 8 gb it was bend new but wrong gb i sent it back and a refund was made nice doing bussness with them"
"Apple",1,"I bought this phone 3 months ago. Initially I didn't use any sim card to use as a Phone, I only used wi fi to access some web sites. Today I took this phone to a pre-paid Phone company to insert a sim card, couldn't activate the phone. The phone has some software problem, can't fix it. Now I'm stuck with it, can't use it, can't return it."
"Apple",1,"Phone stopped working after 1 month. Couldn't make or receive calls 80% of the time. Had to eventually change phone"
"Apple",4,"The phone was slow , but at least it looked somewhat new . It worked and everything so I have no complaints other than speed."
"Apple",5,"The iphone was absolutely in perfect condition. We set it up with T-Mobile's sim card and it works perfectly now."
"Apple",5,"Excellent"
"Apple",5,"Great product"
"Apple",5,"As described, fast shipping. Thank you"
"Apple",4,"seller was great old phone worked great and lasted almost 2 years. old technology"
"Apple",1,"The iPhone esthetically is good but is missing the SIM card tray..."
"Apple",1,"The product was listed as new and was delivered with ring toggle button missing and the back was cracked. Also, the screen (digitizer) looked like it was coming off. No ear buds, no charge cable, no box, nada! Need I say more?"
"Apple",4,"Awesome phone at a great price!!!"
"Apple",3,"I can download some things and I can take picture messages, but the phone likes to shut itself off whenever I'm doing any of those things for too long (ie more than 7 minutes)."
"Apple",5,"i love it."
"Apple",5,"nice phone"
"Apple",3,"Is white instead of Black but is in very good condition and seems to work great so far."
"Apple",3,"Sound up and down on own"
"Apple",5,"Can not tell it from new"
"Apple",5,"Great Product, the item was way better that expected specially the quality."
"Apple",3,"This phone had a technical problem, the ringer menu was always popped-out on the screen and never gone away and when you minimized the volume, the next thing happened, it was automatically turned up to the maximum volume. That's the reason why I've returned it. Glad that I've got a full refund. Thank you."
"Apple",1,"came with a damaged area inside the screen where the slide to open occurs, won't read 2 new SIM cards, is NOT a new phone, and shows signs of wear. Hope to be able to exchange it because it took 3 weeks to get it and 6 weeks to get the new SIM card in the mail in rural AK, by then expirations occur on returns."
"Apple",2,"Such a Bummer. The phone was marketed as Un-Locked. It an ATT box that said NEW- complete with Apple-Ear-buds etc.Had already decided to free myself from T-MOBILE- Went to Cricket. Store manager & his asst. tried to get this I-PHONE to work- multiple Micro SIm cards etc. Result- store owner said something is WRONG with the phone. So I figure on a total of Six hours Wasted. I Guess- U Get What U Pay For. I really wanted an I-Phone- but no way can I afford the New Model."
"Apple",5,"works fine!"
"Apple",5,"Excellent, met all expectations and a bit more. Further, I bought two as my demands aren't high and the price was good. Further,was more concerned about either dropping in the ""drink"" or ""injuring"" it in some way. Turned our that's what happend as I was carrying it in a holster while crawling about under a sink and screwed up the display. The Apple back up worked as advertised."
"Apple",5,"i love the item thanks"
"Apple",5,"Very good product. Worked perfectly with straight talk sim card. I would recomend it to anyone looking for a cheap Iphone."
"Apple",3,"The item arrived on time, it's battery would not accep a charge at first, after leaving it plugged for several hours it finally took a charge, but once fully charged the charge would not last more than a couple hours, had to replace the battery, it works fine now."
"Apple",1,"I am very disappointed in this cellphone. It does not have the features I was looking for.Is there anyway to return this iphone??"
"Apple",5,"Thank you for your HONEST service (TD) it was great....the iPhone 3Gs 16GB works great with my b Mobile SIM card (in Trinidad) it is factory unlocked not jail broken just as they said because i don't see a CEDIA icon, the box came sealed, the word iPhone etc at the back of the iPhone itself (is not in gray like the 3G) its written in silver to the back so you know its a 3Gs. I was scared at first since it was an online purchase but things turnout to be just as they said it will be."
"Apple",1,"Phone shuts on and off on its own. phone also shows no service for hours and does not function properly"
"Apple",4,"The Apple iPhone i purchased had a couple of scratches but nothing really to take notice, otherwise very nice product. I was able to use my Sim card and use my cellular service, once i put it in slot."
"Apple",3,"The phone is good but the back dude is lije a rumble against the floor but the phone work perfect an the unloked is real"
"Apple",5,"Phone works well with T-Mobile.The battery life is not all that great, but over all this is a terrific phone. I would highly recommend it to anyone constantly on the go."
"Apple",2,"Do NOT get this phone! It drops calls constantly. When you end a call it always searches for service and takes several minutes to reconnect to service.Worst customer service by a company that I have experienced. Doesn't listen to your question and is rude when replying to requests."
"Apple",5,"I ordered this used iphone for my son instead of buying him a ipod. The price was better than that of a new ipod and he can use it on his cell phone plan. The phone came unlocked and as described. He is very happy with it."
"Apple",5,"Excellent product and service. Thanks."
"Apple",1,"Phone only lasted 2 weeks."
"Apple",1,"It locked me out and cannot access it anymore, and they did little to help"

"Apple",3,"It works alright."
"Apple",2,"Improve defect >> but not bad"
"Apple",2,"One of the speakers (right side) is not working, not good support from the seller. Sometimes the phone shut down when using wi-fi, even when battery is above 70%."
"Apple",1,"I bought it as a gift for my Mother. The only good ting from this seller is fast shipping. That is it!I don't check the quality first because I think it is new, and more than that I trust the seller.However, the problems of this products are:bad battery: every 15 minutes, the phone is too hot for user to use.Most of the parts of the phone were changed by something else ( it means they use old stuff to replace new stuff, more than that the earphone looks like new one was useless).I pay $220 for nothing My mom is in Vietnam Now when I receive the phone it has been over 30 days to return for full refund. so what can I do with it?"
"Apple",4,"I purchased this used and the phone arrived on time . It was unlocked and works well. There were some scratches to the back of the phone but it didn't matter to me, nothing a case or phone skin couldn't solve."
"Apple",5,"its perfect and excellente price, factory unlock and sealed condition! it is great and a good choice to every people"
"Apple",2,"Item Not working. This is my first time trying to get an affordable phone for me to get around in my mobility cart and no luck so far,Thank You"
"Apple",5,"Very happy with iPhone3GS. Phone was as described. Works perfectly with Consumer Cellular. Very satisfied customer and would recommend vendor and product to anyone."
"Apple",1,"well i bought this phone online because it was unlocked and i was going out to europe and as soon as i landed in spain i had to waste 50 euros replacing the battery since the phone would shut down if the charge was below 70% and i recieved a call. The guy in applestore Barcelona told me it was refurbished and not new too."
"Apple",5,"Everything seems top knotch now! I'll refer you to a friend who is looking for the same phone. Thanks for your help in getting things working!"
"Apple",5,"great phone, arrived ontime and as promised. it was just what i needed to travel. accepted the sim and i was able to change sims when i changed countries."
"Apple",5,"Icheaprepair packed very nicely the used iphone which seems to work more than fine. I belive it is ,as advertised, factory unlocked , but couldn't check it with other operators. It came with a silicone shell , and the wall charger. Not headphones but no pb as it is an used phone. I highly recommend them. Many thanks."
"Apple",5,"It is a great phone. It can be used anywhere and it is easy to use the shipping was on time a great service"
"Apple",5,"It would be nicer if I had service in my home from Tmobile for this ;phone. Outside, it is great- not in my house."
"Apple",5,"This unlocked phone works great on T-Mobile. I just had to insert the SIM card from my old black-berry phone. Within a few minutes, it got signal. Because it was factory unlocked, it was updated to to iOS 6 just fine and remained unlocked afterward. Don't buy those iPhones that are unlocked by software, because you can't update iOS.My existing T-Mobile contract doesn't have a data plan. All I had to do was disabling 3G and Data from Settings > General > Cellular. After that Wi-Fi works fine and I don't have to pay for a data plan.Note that if you do a factory reset on the phone, the only way to get through the initial setup is either by having a data plan or activate via USB cable attached to a computer having iTune installed.The condition of the phone is dependent on who you buy it from. My copy was near perfect."
"Apple",1,"This was an AT&T phone with cheap accessories; Apple was spelled as Abble suggesting Middle East as the origin. It was defective; had signal problems, messages didn't go through. However, the seller (24.Hour.Shipping) was nice and issued a refund including return shipping. Thanks.Please, do NOT buy cell phones on the internet!"
"Apple",1,"The phone arrived on time and in perfect condition (brand new, factory packaged). Unfortunately, the phone was LOCKED.LOVE the iPhone, but item was NOT as described. It was described as Factory Unlocked / Not Jailbroken."
"Apple",5,"The iphone 3GS met all my expectations and went beyond. I was concerned about performance after upgrading it to the latest version of IOS, but I went ahead to do it anyway. It has performed well ever since."
"Apple",5,"Nice price."
"Apple",5,"Thanks."
"Apple",3,"i loved it at first cos it was looking almost very new to me, only to realize that the middle button was a little bit bad. and before the next day after purchase the button stopped working totally and the battery wouldn't hold a charge any longer. i wished the seller spelt out these problems i would have loved to forgo it. this was totally disastrous to me cos i bought this to sell it out for a gain, now why would i sell this to someone else too bad and i doubt i'll buy again."
"Apple",5,"Excelent product!!"
"Apple",3,"Phone meets the expectation but the charger is not working"
"Apple",4,"I received the phone on time. It's in very good condition. I put in a sim card that I had from T-mobile and it works fine. It came with ear buds and a charger which unfortunately doesn't work. Overall I'm satisfied I've only had it for a few weeks but everything ( apart from the charger) has been OK so far. I would buy from them again."

"Apple",5,"received in great condition, works great on my cricket service"

"Apple",4,"I was skeptical about buying the unlock iPhone 3GS from Amazon after seeing the bad reviews, but I checked with the seller and went ahead and purchased it after he confirmed it. I gotta say, I'm very happy with this purchase. It wasn't hard to set up the sim's card into the device. It came in the mail like it was brand new with the original packaging and everything. I love texting and calling my friends and family with it. I have experienced the white screen of death, but I restarted it without a second thought and everything has been fine ever since. I haven't really experience any serious heating problems and I've played some high capacity games on it while being plugged in. It does get rather warm in the hands, but it wasn't enough to be uncomfortable for me. The main reason why I got this phone was because I wanted an easier and more convenient way to call and text my friends and family. The phone I had before was a flip phone without a proper keyboard. This does what I want and so much more. For $115, I got a really good deal and I'm happy to say that I'll be using this until my dad stops paying for the contract or it does die out on me. Just to let those who have flip phones know, the iPhone 3GS can PREVENT data being used when you're not on that plan. The flip phone that I had would take me onto the web without warning me first and that caused my phone to be charged a few extra dollars for just a few seconds of being on the internet. At least now, I don't have to worry about those slippages because I can only use data when i'm using wi-fi.I don't really have any complaints for this phone because it's more then what I want in an phone, but as an Apple product, I have to say that the screen really takes a miss. I'm so spoiled by Retina Display on my iPod Touch 5g, that it bugs me when everything is in low resolution. When comparing watching videos or pictures, it's just ain't the same. It's good when I'm bored at college, but for casual use, it's not that great from today's standards.It's a little bulky, but I kind of like it that way. It gives it a feel to it and it doesn't slip out of my hands unlike the new iPod Touch.Seeing that I got the white screen of death on the second day scared me. I'm hoping that wasn't the reason why the seller sold it to me.Summery:Pros:Great for a phone and great for texting.Has great cellular connection.Satisfying battery life.Can handle playing games without taking too much heat.Can prevent using data on cellular network unlike my old flip phone.Cons:Poor screen quality compared to today's standard for Apple products.Sort of bulky, but having some weight is a pro for me.White screen of death on the second day of using it."
"Apple",5,"The phone meets all my requirements and more.Was easy to set up with my Carrier ( AT&T)Lightning fast"
"Apple",1,"Well, the camera appeared to be broken and the phone itself is kinda slow. Not satisfied at all. Need to order another phone now."
"Apple",3,"the item was not had been as described, they said in good condition but when i received it has a big scratch at the back and has small crack at the charger port."
"Apple",5,"Love it love it !!! It is exactly what was advertised that I receive at the allotted time I was promised... Took it to AT&T store the transferred all my info except my music to my brand new iPhone 3GS I told all my friends to go to amazon for all their needs*******"
"Apple",5,"it arrived exactly as amazon said it would, the phone was in excellent condition and brand new as far as I could tell and works like a charm ... may not be the newest model but suits my needs to a tee for an excellent price."
"Apple",1,"This phone it was supposed to be brand new and when I receive it I realize the the phone was used the screen was replace and the phone charger had water damage sings so I'm not happy"
"Apple",1,"My daughter saved her money all year long to by her own iphone, and when we got it it wouldn't even power on. The battery wouldn't charge. We sent the phone back and they replaced the battery and we thought we were in good shape. Now the ringer switch is causing the phone to vibrate constantly, the speaker doesn't work anymore, and the headphones keep cutting out. We contacted them just over 30 days and now we're stuck with this POS!!!"
"Apple",1,"i observed it for a couple of weeks and i found out that every time i have a incoming calls and out going calls the phone is turning off and even the battery icon still in high percentage. i don't know what's wrong with this phone. can i return it and check what's the problem?"
"Apple",2,"The phone has zero battery life. As soon as it is unplugged from the power socket the battery runs down."
"Apple",4,"So far the iPhone 4 from this seller has been working as promised."
"Apple",1,"It didn't come with all the things it said was with the phone."
"Apple",1,"Net10 does NOT support this phone...I have no idea what they were thinking...had to go to verizon...love the phone...hate verizon..Not happy!"
"Apple",2,"This is a nice phone, but it is not net ten ready it can only be serviced through Verizon. I learned that the hard way and bought everything for net ten and spent two days trying to activate it to find out you can only use Verizon ."
"Apple",1,"Phone works with network. But old technology does not allow for apps. Phone screen cracked on arrival but not enough to interrupt use. Screen cracks easily and in general phone seems cheap. Great for kids or as inexpensive option if you can't afford newest phones but you get what you pay for"
"Apple",1,"Didn't work for my area Disappointed returned it"
"Apple",5,"it works great"
"Apple",3,"Was not for Net10 but was ready for Straight Talk. Also did not come with all the extra stuff which I think I should be either refunded some money or sent the stuff as promised. Awesome phones though in really good condition and got here pretty fast. Me and my girlfriend do enjoy them but the information is wrong."
"Apple",5,"great lave it to my son he loves it"
"Apple",5,"It was all I expected"
"Apple",5,"Comes ready to activate and simple instructions to activate it. It just didn't come with extra chargers or car charger"
"Apple",5,"Vary happy and any 1who says is not net 10 is a liar."
"Apple",1,"It got here on time but it is not net 10 ready."
"Apple",3,"Gets the job done but no Voicemail? Not sure if that is just my service or the phone or a setting. Advice would be awesome. Thanks."
"Apple",5,"I love this photo unlocked GSM like new"
"Apple",4,"wish I had known BEFORE I got it for my daughter's bday that it can't be activated without a SIM card as it was previously used and owned by AT&T. Ended up having to place another order for a sim card just to get wifi for it and wait another week."
"Apple",5,"The phone was in great shape. Very good investment from our end."
"Apple",5,"Looked new. No scratches and unlocked. works great with Tracfone. Very good value for the price."
"Apple",3,"I like the phone only problem with it is u have to upgrade it for some apps an it wont even upgrade it"
"Apple",3,"Packaging was good, what it can with was good, but the phone itself I had problems with. I currently have tmobile and the phone is lacking service every now and then, I had s few stops between apple and tmobile, both saying its SIM card. So far havnt figure out a solution"
"Apple",5,"Exactly what I payed for. Works just fine."
"Apple",5,"Item arrived quickly and was exactly as described. Thank you very much!"
"Apple",1,"NO MORE APPLE UPDATES,FOR APPLE IPHONE 4,OR APPLE IPHONE 4S. DONT BUY,AS PHONE."
"Apple",5,"Great phone! Love it! Service was perfect"
"Apple",5,"Works great took it to AT&T they put a SIM card in for free and it work great🤗 Phone in perfect condition."
"Apple",1,"Just recieved the iphone and activation error keeps popping up and wont let me go any further.😤"
"Apple",5,"It was a great gift for my little boy for reasonable price . I love shopping at Amazon"
"Apple",4,"The phone works great the plastic over the sceen looked old but when I removed it the phone look like new...."
"Apple",5,"I'm very happy with this purchase, the phone looks like brand new, everything works fine, and the vendor shipped the merchandise fast.So far I did not have any problem with it, A+"
"Apple",3,"I use this phone for the apps and for wi-fi. I cannot use it as a phone because everyone I tried said they were not capatible the whole reason I picked a phone without a SIM card was so I could choose who I wanted as my carrier but after spending an entire day driving around I found out it wasn't capatible with Straight Talk, Verizon, AT&T, Sprint, Boost, or T- Mobile. So if you need a phone to use as a phone don't pick this one but if you are looking for something you can use for the apps and to get on line using wifi then the phone works great."
"Apple",4,"The phone is good  but I felt it is slower than usual"
"Apple",5,"Excelent"
"Apple",1,"the microphone of the phone dont work, not able to hear in a call, just with speakers."
"Apple",5,"Awesome product,perfectly in working condition. Not a single scratch.battery life is awesome too. All of these just for $69.Of course i just got it, ill post a review again in 3 months, fingers crossed."
"Apple",5,"Love my phone-no problem activating it."
"Apple",5,"very nice"
"Apple",4,"work perfectly"
"Apple",5,"I like this phone"
"Apple",5,"Amazing value for this once highly-coveted phone. Looked & felt brand new."
"Apple",1,"Poor quality, would not stay charged, no sound I was only able to talk on speaker. Contacted the company it appears they are too busy to assist me with my problem. Amazon very helpful."
"Apple",3,"My husband is very happy with the phone. He had been using an android phone and hated it. This one is very easy to use."
"Apple",5,"Look like new and work fine."
"Apple",1,"The phone wasn't ready to use/ as promised. Needed to return the phone. Got refund.Wasting time ...."
"Apple",5,"Bought this for my son who has been wanting one to be like the other kids at school. It works great & is exactly what he wanted. Great buy"
"Apple",5,"I really the phone, I want to buy another one"
"Apple",1,"My order came defective. It will not charge. I have six other Iphones. Love them a lot."
"Apple",5,"I loved"
"Apple",5,"Works great and no scratches or damage. Safely packaged phone"
"Apple",2,"Battry was no good some refurbish job"
"Apple",1,"Phone not working"
"Apple",1,"you claim it is a phone that use sim card but no slut found in the phone"
"Apple",5,"works"
"Apple",1,"Over paid!!!!! Did not come with charger/accessories!!! False advertising!!! DO NOT BUY!!!!!"
"Apple",1,"never workd"
"Apple",1,"Someone gave me money to buy this product and they won't please with it. So I had to give dem money from my pocket. Am very disappointed"
"Apple",3,"none"
"Apple",1,"I was so happy and excited when I got this phone as a gift from my wife, but I was so disappointed because there was something wrong with the microphone. People couldn't hear me and I had to use the speaker which was awkward because people didn't know why they were on speaker! I eventually returned it and luckily got a refund."
"Apple",5,"Good product"
"Apple",5,"I got this phone for my grandaughter for Christmas. She loves it!"
"Apple",5,"thanks"
"Apple",5,"perfect"
"Apple",1,"this phone was sold as new worked for 3 mnths then stopped took it to the nearest apple store which was 3 hrs away for them to tell me it was a ""frankinstien"" meaning there were some apple parts an some that were not now NOBODY will help 300$ just gone"
"Apple",2,"It's not bad for the price, but there is lots of glitches in it! Another thing, it says it comes with a charger and it didn't! The only thing good about it is that it came quick!!"
"Apple",5,"Good"
"Apple",4,"Iphone came in very good condition as described, but the charger was not working well. I had to get a new one. Besides that, everything was ok."
"Apple",5,"A++"
"Apple",3,"Overall the phone works fine, but some of the buttons stick or don't work at times"
"Apple",2,"did not function well - very disappointed in the product. not as described."
"Apple",1,"This is my first return on Amazon and it appears to be very easy. As far as the product is concerned, its looks great but works terribly. Clearly a defect of some sort...all well, will return and purchase a new one"
"Apple",3,"I buy this second hand I phone 4 the looks is great but I'm just disappointed coz it won't work properly something wrong on calling somebody they can't hear me."
"Apple",1,"the description of the telephone was that it was a telephone released by to that buys it reason when arrives the telephone to me that him introdusco sim card does not serve because only it is possible to be used for AT& T deberia to demand it to sell articles that do not have a correct description if I wanted a telephone of AT& T I buy it to AT& T and not to a swindler"
"Apple",3,"The iphone 4 shipped quick and came with all accessories in the original packaging. The phone looked almost brand new but the home button did not always register. Ive heard that this issue is not that uncommon because lint and dust get trapped under the button. This was however a $315 phone listed as ""like new"" so I expected it to work flawlessly. This is my first amazon return but the process has been pretty easy so far."
"Apple",2,"i bought i phone 4 and this i phone supposed to be used like new but i surprised when i found the back camera is scratched and not working , really it was very bad"
"Apple",5,"WOULD LIKE TO KNOW IF THE IPHONE IS UNLOCKED ? I AM FROM VENEZUELA AND ME KNOW IF I WANT MY COUNTRY IS IN GOOD BUY IT NOW SO I HOPE YOUR ANSWER THANK YOU!"
"Apple",2,"The iphone 4 was unlocked is a problem for me I had to take and spend more than they should excuse my English"
"Apple",5,"It was a pretty good item and not bad price it was a little scratched up but i can fix that easyly so"
"Apple",1,"It didn't work. The microphone wouldn't work half the time and the person couldn't hear me. Photos were unclear with lines across the screen!"
"Apple",1,"The phone does NOT work right, and never has. Sure, you can call out on it, and you can receive calls BUT ....no one can HEAR YOUR VOICE ... unless you switch the 'speaker phone' on! That part is not working right, and it has not since the day we received it. This was a gift for someone without a phone at all, and now she has one that only works halfway! NOT RIGHT! I've written the Seller already and now have submitted a claim via Amazon too. So far, the Seller is NOT returning emails or calls. Maybe Amazon itself will have better luck -- and if not, perhaps this store does not need to be an Amazon store at all.Let's see if they answer this, the THIRD request for replacement! A full replacement or even a full return of funds in the next 24 hours would certainly be welcome since we thought we bought a WORKING CELL phone. This one does not work right, period. we demand a replacement that works or a full refund within the next ten(10) days."
"Apple",5,"This is my first apple product ever. I had been wanting one for years but this was in my price range. A lot of my friends have the 5 or 5s and all suggested I start with the 4 since they feel the ios system is better on it. The phone I got was used, but looks near to new. Only a few extremely light scratches that you can't even see when looking directly at it."
"Apple",4,"For the price i paid the phone was in excellent condition! No scratches at all!!! All buttons worked great. Got phone activated yesterday with no issues. The only thing i didn't like was the amazon sticker was on the back of the phone and is VERY HARD TO GET OFF. Perhaps vacuum sealing the phone and putting the label on the plastic would be much better in the future. I cant scrape the sticker off due to the back being made of glass!"
"Apple",4,"It was fast and the shipping was minutes after I made the delicious to buy the phone, I was needing any phone cause I lost mine phone"
"Apple",1,"I need you to do the reverse in a gift card not refund my card because those dollars are the only ones I had and made me lose that money because in my country we do not handle that currency and it becomes very difficult to acquire and I think a irresponsibility on your part shall carry out, then q let her buy it so long to inform you could not sell the product then q I would like my money come back in a gift car so we can make a new purchase on this page thank you very much and expect an answer as this seems to me a grave lack of respect for my"
"Apple",1,"there were multiple issues with the phone that was supposed to be refurbished. this was the first product I purchased through here that I can say was a waste of money and I order a lot."
"Apple",1,"This is clearly the wrong phone and it would be excellent if whomever repackaged this actually looked at the box which clearly states VERIZON not what it was sold as AT&T. The irony here is these 2 different networks also use different carries AT&T is GSM and Verizon is CDMA. So this phone is a complete fail there too."
"Apple",4,"Only one speaker works and it's not unlocked... Other than that it works pretty good but just those problems. Yeah."
"Apple",4,"Love my phone, the only complaint I have, was how it was packaged."
"Apple",3,"I have discovered they do not make Apple products like they used to...the top button locked up on the third day of having it."
"Apple",4,"came in good condition"
"Apple",3,"It's fine but the volume is really low when talking."
"Apple",3,"Good"
"Apple",5,"Perfect!"
"Apple",5,"A family member keeps breaking his phone. I didn't want to buy a brand new one. This re-furbished phone is working great and I couldn't beat the price."
"Apple",5,"Thanks so much I give you A++++"
"Apple",1,"its a use cellphone. thats not a brand new"
"Apple",4,"Returned it cause I needed a 4s"
"Apple",1,"worked for one day"
"Apple",5,"Love it"
"Apple",3,"My phone was supposed to be iphone 4s 32g but it jus iphone four and is only set up for ios 6 cant update or download versions of apps i used to have"
"Apple",5,"Easy Transaction exactly what I expected."
"Apple",5,"good"
"Apple",3,"I got it but the cable is not from apple and is Blue color also the cable has cut"
"Apple",5,"GREAT"
"Apple",5,"just what I expected"
"Apple",5,"Works perfect came in perfect condition thank you"
"Apple",1,"Does not work as advertised"
"Apple",4,"It says just what you get in the mail, very nice and functional equipment, will definately recommend it ! Delivered a day late but no complaints."
"Apple",1,"Got this phone because my android smart phone would only hold a charge for 5 hours. On the plus side, this phone holds a charge for days, on the negative side, folks don't get my texts sometimes, or I don't get their texts sometimes, and it ALWAYS cuts my call off when I've only been talking for a few minutes. Must just be my particular phone, my daughter has one and has no problems with hers. I'm going back to my android smart phone. This one is garbage, sorry I bought it."
"Apple",4,"I fine this phone to be very well made, and it's loaded. I had a android phone before my iPhone, if I had to rate the difference I would pick this phone first. This phone is much more sophisticated, but people friendly."
"Apple",1,"The purchase of this iphone 4 has caused me so much hassle and waste of time. What a total regret buying this phone from ""mobilekarma"" Not only was it sold to me as a blacklisted phone, there's no way to get this iphone off the list. I had contacted mobile karma and they have no means to settling or solving this issue."
"Apple",1,"this phone is locked to another AT&T network and does not accept a USA AT&T sim card this is very frustrating"
"Apple",5,"My husband loves his phone.It was the perfect gift .Thank you I'm looking forward to finding more gifts for family"
"Apple",1,"This company seems like a joke to me, I got the phone but at least once a week I have to reset it. Like factory reset it. For the money I paid, shipping hassles I had, that is not worht"
"Apple",2,"This product arrived in box and with accessories that work! But we paid too much for this phone bc it continuously goes to the reboot screen! We are trying to find out how to fix this problem...but it is difficult!"
"Apple",1,"After spending an addt'l $100 to replace the broken glass, once service was activated, we found out the owner did not remove his personal information and in order for us to do it, we needed his password. After several conversations with the seller, at the end of the day, he would not provide his pass code thus the phone was useless."
"Apple",5,"My son wanted to be iphone nation but I had just switched carriers. So I was not going to pay full price for a new phone. Then I said let me look on Amazon.com. this phone did not have scratch on it. Perfect condition. My son loves it. Thank you. Money well spent."
"Apple",5,"I love this phone. It came brand new in the wrapped box with all parts included. It was considerably less expensive than many other competitors on Amazon which I worried meant it was too good to be true. Some others were selling this phone with the same specifications for much more.. I gave it as a gift because I had already bought one for myself. The price was so low compared to others for a 4s 32GB iphone w/at&t access. The price scared me a little but it was amazon guaranteed so I took a chance and purchased it and it was perfect.. the person I gave it to as a gift won't stop thanking me for it. Don't be afraid of a good price is the lesson to be learned I guess..."
"Apple",5,"Bought this as a replacement to my broken 8GB iPhone. If you already own an iPhone then you know how useful and widely owned these are. if you don't have one, Apple products, while seemingly fragile, do work extremely well for a long time in terms of performance and durability. I never knew someone who had a physically defective apple anything after any given amount of time. These things do not fall apart ever."
"Apple",5,"its everything that was described to be, I love it! AAA+++++ thank you!!!! this is a honest and fair dealer, just as described!"
"Apple",3,"The phone is reliable it works a lilttle slow and the home button has to be pressed hard but after that it is a good product"
"Apple",4,"This iPhone 4 works great. It came in a box that appeared to be new. The iPhone 4 is not the newest but in my case it gets the job done."
"Apple",1,"The iPhone 4 was sold as like new condition, the bottom right corner glass was shattered and the button intermittently works. It cost me $136 to have it repaired"
"Apple",5,"Great phone! I would recommend it. It may not be the newest version of the iPhone but they are all the same thing in my view. I replaced my blackberry torch with this one."
"Apple",5,"I am very pleased with this item. The phone arrived within a short period of time. It was in a great shape and the seller even included a nice case and a charger."
"Apple",3,"The phone comes in a box like a brand new iPhone. I thought everything was fine with it but It drops a lot of calls and it freezes every once in awhile."
"Apple",5,"Buy this cellphone as a gift for my wife, I like it because it is small and easy to use for her. The system uses the cellphone iphone is very stable."
"Apple",4,"Great phone , but not a contract phone with AT&T"
"Apple",5,"A gift. Passed the grandson test."
"Apple",5,"Great!"
"Apple",5,"great phone"
"Apple",2,"Not happy!!!"
"Apple",5,"Got phone in 3 days! Great phone, very like new!"
"Apple",4,"Love it so far. The Home button doesn't work but the seller told me that at the very beginning. The assisted Home button (setting you have to turn on) works great."
"Apple",5,"goods"
"Apple",1,"this is one of the worst products i've ever bought from Apple ive had it encased in a otter box for protection and upkeep and it still regularly blips out. so far as the battery is concerned it regularly abruptly dies even if one moment before it reads 40-50% power, and the power button stopped working soon after i got it. do yourself a favor if you're considering apple for a phone just go with Samsung, LG, or something else. it's not worth the faulty poor quality and headaches this one will bring you."
"Apple",2,"The product was a huge disappointment. After a week of use, callers could not hear your voice when you called out on the phone. The only way to use the phone, as a phone, is with headphones. I do not recommend product and did not purchase the product just to be able to text."
"Apple",5,"The iphone is in great conditions as it was told on the details, thank you very happy with my order =]"
"Apple",5,"I really like the phone, Thanks It came nicely with bubble wrap so it would not bounce around, again Thanks"
"Apple",2,"I absolutely love the phone, the only problem I have is that when I call someone or receive a call the person on the other end can not hear me."
"Apple",5,"Shipped and arrived on time....Item was just like new and as advertised. Getting the 32GB is worth it if you like having movies on your phone."
"Apple",5,"Works great, received this phone on the date that was published, but as soon as i got it the battery was not fully charged and the charger was not working so i received a new charger. Now the phone is in great condition."
"Apple",5,"excelente buenas condiciones el telefono muy eficiente garantizado o o o o o o o o o o o ok"
"Apple",5,"Great deal, came in time, had it for over a month now, works Perfect just like it should.. I guess I just got lucky this time..:/ but yeah, good sell:)"
"Apple",4,"Phone works great! Delivery was quick, getting it unlocked and switched was a pain, but otherwise! Glad I finally have a Smart phone...."
"Apple",5,"I love the product that was purchased thru amazon. I love the prices the fast delivery and the quality of the phone that I have now. Thank you amazon!! A+"
"Apple",1,"the device shap looked good but i have problem with the home key... it was bad, otherwise it was good"
"Apple",5,"Perfect!"
"Apple",5,"I still use it, works great"
"Apple",4,"Phone as arrived better condition than description. Happy :)"
"Apple",3,"thak you"
"Apple",5,"Arrived in condition as advertised. I did not have any problems with upgrade. Works and looks great."
"Apple",5,"We had a question about the iPhone and the dealer got back with us the same day we asked. They explain to us some items about the iPhone and our grandson is very satisfied with his new phone."
"Apple",2,"defective, had to send back"
"Apple",4,"Great purchase! It was as good as new... Screen was immaculate and had no surface scratched. I'm very satisfied with my purchase."
"Apple",3,"It's a great product for a great price. It was in good condition and arrived exactly on the day I expected it to."
"Apple",5,"My iPhone was bought from used powerbookmac.com & it is flawless no scratches or scuffs.i had my phone unlocked from third party vender(60 bucks).because they had no pervious owner info they buy then in bulk.but you can still unlock it through a third party vender. But all in all my iPhone is great the best phone I ever had. It's my first iPhone and for used the shot I took was right on the money. Fast, smooth, clean & crisp like an iPhone is. Buy from the vender if possible. They won't let you down. Item was as describe fast shipping they respond to emails, friendly service, plus only $94 for an used iPhone great deal great experience. A must buy.***** star rating"
"Apple",3,"no comments"
"Apple",4,"So far its being doing fine."
"Apple",5,"I believe I bought this used for my son and it was in great working condition."
"Apple",2,"I received the phone the day before I expected it and the condition was better than expected. But when placing phone calls the person on the other line can not hear you. I constantly breaks up. had to go back to old cell phone and looking to purchase another phone. the two stars are for the shipping time and appearance."
"Apple",5,"Was worried about buying a used phone. I'm very happy with my purchase. Looks and works great! Definitely recommend it!"
"Apple",5,"I love my new iphone, i arrived on time, nw i got all my apps onit. I can reach family and friend near or far"
"Apple",1,"Purchased this product as new. Proximity sensor failed. Apple support told me this phone was purchased in 2011and had no factory warranty. Company will not do any replacement after 30 days, so beware. I have a phone that I cannot use for phone calls. I will not purchase from these people as they state the product is new, but it is not!,"
"Apple",4,"Phone was brand new and worked great.. I also recieved it in 2 business days which was awesome because I paid for standard shipping..my only complaint is the price was a little ridiculous for an iPhone 4 so I'm rating the phone a 4"
"Apple",4,"Great phone"
"Apple",5,"Purchased several as gifts. They arrived on time and were in good condition as the Seller had described. Please note that none of these gift iphones were put on the carrier named. They went on the month to month plans offered at a major chain store that sold a package deal of buy the chip and get a month air time free. Many months later they are all working fine. And the low budget carrier service is even better than my personal 2-year contract carrier.I plan to purchase more of these as gifts soon."
"Apple",2,"Very slow and I am disappointed"
"Apple",3,"One of the speakers doesn't work.."
"Apple",5,"Amaising....thanks you...!!!!😉👌"
"Apple",1,"I received it in pretty good shape , but it does not work, can't make any calls or get any"
"Apple",3,"Would of liked a printed booklet of how to set things up.I am senor citizen & need to read something other than on just phone..Had to purchase ""how to book"""
"Apple",4,"The phone was in excellent condition and we have had no issues with it. The charger stopped working about a week later. Other than that I have nothing negative to say about our experience."
"Apple",2,"Had to get it fixed the next day"
"Apple",5,"Perfect!"
"Apple",5,"Still using it"
"Apple",4,"I love it . It was what I needed . thank you very much."
"Apple",3,"One of the speakers on the phone doesnt work ,the sound is low"
"Apple",3,"The home button sticks bad. You have to push a few times hard to have it respond."
"Apple",5,"Great"
"Apple",5,"Great phone my son wanted a iPhone so I decided to go with the 4 until I know he can be responsible with it. Came the day it was suppose to unlocked no problem at all."
"Apple",5,"Thanks it work well"
"Apple",1,"This is my second one, and is really frustrating because i have to take it too have everything copied. I can hear other people on line, but they can not hear me sometimes."
"Apple",5,"I am in love with my new phone no marks looks brand new so far having no problems with it I got it in 1 day and I'm just very excited."
"Apple",1,"Only works with AT&T, no boostmobile no sim card"
"Apple",4,"It's very good"
"Apple",5,"It has all the features needed to make you totally dependent on it. Just try loosing one."
"Apple",5,"Ordered for my son and he has been pleased with the phone. Bought a case for this one. :)Telephone was in good condition with no scratches. Actually better than the description."
"Apple",1,"The phone looked to be in perfect shape. However after 2 weeks of use, phone calls seem to have lots of static then would automatically disconnect.Unable to hear or be heard. Very disappointed. In the process of getting a refund. No exchange was offered."
"Apple",1,"My understanding was that the Iphone I ordered was unlocked for me to use during my international travel, unfortunately It wasn't, as a matter of fact it cost me more, because I purchased a new T-Mobile Sim card, in addition to wasting half of my day trying to get the Iphone to operate. I have to tell you I am not happy with how the Iphone was advertised, it should be clear it was locked."
"Apple",3,"Bought the refurbished iPhone 4 after son's iPhone 3 was stolen while still too early for inexpensive upgrade from AT&T. While I expected minor imperfections (e.g scratches on case), I did not expect that the ear speaker on the phone did not work at all. My son can only use the speakerphone setting or his earbuds while making a call. For the money spent, I expected this part would be working."
"Apple",1,"The product was advertised as ...""IPHONE 4 32GB BLACK.UNLOCKED USING TURBO SIM . UNLOCKED TO USE FOR ANY CARRIER. NEW CONDITION AND COMES WITH ALL ACCESSORIES: WALL CHARGER, USB CABLE, and HEADPHONES.This phone is Brand new, with box, charger and earbuds . The phone is unlocked using Gevey""The phone works fine, but I took it to t-mobile, and they said it was locked. Also, it appears to be the 04.11.08 baseband, which is apparently more difficult to unlock than most.Sent an email, but no response after a couple of days."
"Apple",5,"Phone waa a great purchase, was in great condition no scratches came in an iphone 4 box which was a nice touch."
"Apple",4,"If your an Apple customer you'll love it , just like new , no scratches or appearance of usage .Be sure to have your sim card ready for it ... Comes in box with all accessories needed."
"Apple",1,"Very upset with this product. It says its unlocked using Gevey sim which it is not. The phone i received had too new of a baseband to unlock. Had sratches on back too... Looks like i just bought a $350 paper weight until baseband can be unlocked..... what a SCAM"
"Apple",4,"this product has really good features, its functionality it's awesome, other thing about it that i like it's its graphics its applications."
"Apple",5,"I love this phone. Granted I'm always near a computer or tablet the iphone is great when out and about. It's a user friendly interface and there are a ton of apps. The bluetooth is great too. I use a bluetooth stereo headset at the gym which allows me to play music while keeping my phone safely in the gym bag. Yes apple products a bit expensive but they are darn fun and good. No preinstalled junk apps."
"Apple",4,"Good."
"Apple",3,"Freezes a lot, also you can no longer pay to get att network switched to tmoible are vise versa. Very easy to crack, I ended up getting the iPhone 5 after cracking three 4s's in a year, and I'm much more pleased."
"Apple",5,"i was real impressed its just wat we ordered thanks so much"
"Apple",4,"Nice phone, however it was listed on a page that said 32gb. Must have been mistaken?"
"Apple",5,"Beautiful. Best phone I've ever had. Arrived with maybe two scratches. Is eligible for straight talk from Walmart which is a great deal. Never a loss of service. Excellent buy"
"Apple",2,"I like the phone but when I call somebody and I can hear them but they can not hear me. That sucks cuz I like to talk to people more than texting. Like I can't call work when I'm going to be late. I would have to text someone who going to work that day so they can say that I going to be late."
"Apple",5,"Good shopping"
"Apple",5,"Works great, clean, great condition."
"Apple",5,"5 stars iphone came & looks like new works great"
"Apple",5,"I am very happy with my phone. It actually came 2 days earlier than scheduled. It was in excellent working condition. I read a bunch of reviews before I ordered it. I was worried about buying used electronics. Something I never do. But, I'm glad I did. I saved alot of money and That's always a plus!"
"Apple",5,"it is a nice teleohone！when i uesed chinamobile sim card ，i found the iphone is unlocked。what a surprise！i really love it！"
"Apple",1,"Worst experience ever , ordered a 32gb , iPhone , they sent one that had serious design issues. They expedited another phone to replace it this time it was an 8gb iPhone , I am extremely disappointed and will be very cautious in the future using them to order items or reccommdnding then to others ."
"Apple",4,"Only problem is the home button and a few minor scratches but other than that the phone works perfectly fine!"
"Apple",5,"I PURCHASED THIS ITEM FOR MY HUSBAND AND EVER SINCE IT HAS NOT LEFT HIS FINGERS.LOVE IT NO PROBLEMS AT ALL."
"Apple",4,"iphone 4 is a great pjone . these reviews are what are stupid. you cant just give a rating and go on. NO that have to make it painful."
"Apple",1,"Don't buy this product. They will put an iphone 3 in an iphone 4 box, and hope that you are too stupid to notice."
"Apple",4,"I like iPhone 4 but at the time was looking for a 4s the iPhone 4g was in great shape..."
"Apple",5,"it was in awesome condition it is working perfectly there is nothing wrong. it is an awesome phone i love it"
"Apple",5,"my iPhone 4 16GB came NEW as they said and as I saw when buying it online works great vary good price to been using it ever since it came in the mail I saw peoples views sayin they got uses phones and all this and that but the iPhone I end up buying from one eye mobile . came new in the box and all I paid $370 for a new Iphone 4 16GB and so will I'm happy with my order"
"Apple",5,"Just what I expected ,not the cheapest but need some thing quick to take over seas as a gift,good condition"
"Apple",3,"Phone looks very good. Does have some glitches. Sometimes it will not return to the home screen no matter what. Just have to wait ten minutes or so because when it's stuck it won't even power down but it will let you turn the screen off so at least it isn't draining extra battery. SIM card included was not as expected. The SIM card was disabled and useless. At&t set another for free but took almost a week to arrive. I could have bought same phone without sim card for nearly $15 less. Lesson learned but phone is in good shape."
"Apple",3,"good"
"Apple",5,"Is very good"
"Apple",1,"got phone and didn't work! wasn't even cleaned as i was pulling lint out plug in port"
"Apple",4,"Broke it, ran slow. Did what I needed it to do when I had it though. Lost my first one, so I got this."
"Apple",2,"The phone got very hot when charging. I'm requesting a full refund and a return shipping label. I do not expect to pay for return cost."
"Apple",4,"Yes it did"
"Apple",1,"the phone does not work!!"
"Apple",1,"I thought it was the S4 and it wasn't. My wife wanted the s so she's not happy it was a replacement."
"Apple",3,"its all right , the only problem with it is just like all iPhones is : the home button will partially stop working."
"Apple",4,"The phone does have some very minor cosmetic damage, you wont see it when the case is on and the home button is a bit stubborn but i'll change that soon."
"Apple",1,"I bought this used phone as a Christmas gift and when my wife got around to activating it, it didn't work. Now Amazon was top notch on getting me the cost of the phone and my shipping back but for some reason couldn't get my sales tax back? What kinda ship is that? A full refund is a full refund not a shipping and cost of the phone only refund! The girl who sold the phone had to of known that the phone was defective cause her so called return policy was like 1 or 2 weeks and that was roughly the shipping time. She acted like she had no clue it was defective and told me to bad it's not her policy to take stuff back after that time I should've told her sooner. Thank You Amazon for your standards I just wish that you would have gotten me a FULL refund!!"
"Apple",5,"they arived in time in APO adress-Afghanistan its nice to buy used iphones when they are in good care,without problems,working perfect,recived as described"
"Apple",4,"Good condition and love it, I recomend, Not the best deal $300 but its fair.I don't want any contract and new is too expensive"
"Apple",1,"I received this iphone yesterday but I can not use it..the home botton is not working...the seller said it was working perfect and tha is not true.."
"Apple",5,"Like the title says, Apple products rock! 32GB is currently proving to be more than what I need to store all of my music and apps. I also have a charger-case so my phone lasts throughout the entire day. The phone uses micro sim cards by AT&T as well as T-mobile. I am currently ordering a sim card cutter from Amazon in order to resize the sim card from Straight Talk because Straight Talk does not have micro sim cards anymore."
"Apple",3,"This phone had a few obvious scratches on the face, which were not described on the description of the device. However, it was the glitches thereafter that were disappointing. Within 2 weeks, the speaker function stopped working. I have had the phone since March 2013 and have issues with my 3-way calling feature. I have to turn the phone off...then back on for the conference calling function to work. Lastly, the volume button on the side that mutes the phone has malfunctioned causing the phone to ring when it should be silenced. We pay for what we get...and this used phone has made me leary of ever purchasing another one."
"Apple",5,"i love it its great and the pics are great its just want i wanted a great i phone 4 thank u it cane on time that's what i love about the seller was great and on time and i would order from this company again. thank u again"
"Apple",2,"The iphone 4 worked pretty good for 15 days but started acting up when I pushed the home button. It has 60% before I went to bed and at some point through the night it died. Very disappointed because this is my business phone."
"Apple",1,"I got it today.everything works great but when I make a call receiver can not hear me.Don't buy I would return it back as soon as possible !!!"
"Apple",5,"Great!!"
"Apple",2,"I loved the service I received from Amazon, however, one of the speakers was blown on the Iphone."
"Apple",5,"I love it !"
"Apple",1,"the phone was not unlocked, I can not activate it for not having a sim card at & t"
"Apple",5,"Works great and good condition."
"Apple",2,"less than a year it lasted, of course I bought it used but guess it was a waste of money..."
"Apple",4,"Love it works great"
"Apple",3,"The home button doesn't work half of the time."
"Apple",5,"Even though the iPhone 6 will be out soon, I fell in love with this phone. The processor makes everything super quick, and even though non-market apps are much easier to obtain on an Android, I find that the versatility of the iPhone makes up for it"
"Apple",1,"this product is very bad the sound it's dosent work never"
"Apple",5,"Bought from Amazon Warehouse Deals. Phone came quickly, and I was surprised at the great condition it was in when I received it. The ""cosmetic damage"" was negligible to the point that it looked like a new phone, even though the condition was rated as ""good"". After a few hours of operation I noticed a significant problem with the home button and am sending it back. Going to try my luck with a different AWD iphone."
"Apple",3,"Send it to my girlfriend to the Philippines and spent more to have it activated I thought it was unlocked I should have just bought it over there"
"Apple",1,"SHIPPED A 16 GB WITH A FAKE PAPER PRINTED 32 GB LABLE WITH A BARCODE AND A IMEI NUMBER, TOOK IT TO APPLE AND CONFIRMED IT WAS A 16 GB, AND ATT CONFIRMED THE BARCODE WAS NOT THERES AS THEY DO NOT BARCODE THEIR PHONES THEY USE APPLES ORIGONAL, DO NOT BUY!!!"
"Apple",4,"So far I enjoy this device does everything I needed it to do. I would definitely keep shopping with amazon"
"Apple",5,"Product was in excellent condition. I ordered this to replace the not very user friendly android phone I had been using. I will never have anything but an iPhone from here on out."
"Apple",2,"Fast shipping the item scratch a lot honme button not working wel a camera is not clear need change len"
"Apple",4,"The phone is in great condition and didnt show much signs of wear and was exactly what i was looking for"
"Apple",4,"It is very nice, only issue is it cannot be unlocked due to it is non-full price of purchase. I was told before, if I bought at&t, i can use t-mobile prepaid card. but because of the price, i cannot. Otherwise, this is very helpful cell phone. can you tell me how to recharge the money for each month? which phone number to call for at&t prepaid card? thanks"
"Apple",5,"Wife love her phone"
"Apple",5,"I could not afford a new iPhone 5 so I opted for a used iPhone 4 and it has been excellent so far. The main reason I got it is because of the apps I can use while traveling, birdwatching etc. I used to fumble when answering my phone, but now it is a lot easier...with just a slide action I answer it. The ring on off button is easy to use. Going to 2 different emails is easy. I am learning to deposit checks in my bank account. No more lost checks!"
"Apple",1,"The iphone came like in a week and a half and the screen came cracked and the iphone doesnt even work it stays on the apple"
"Apple",5,"It was a great phone I expected worse but came out to be something better. Really glad I made this purchase no regrets here."
"Apple",5,"I wanted the Iphone 4 without being attached to a contract with a carrier so I decided to buy on Amazon. I was so surprised when I received the phone. It was flawless; no scratches or dings looks like new. The phone works very well and came with the apple charger, apple ear phones, documentation, and apple stickers. It shipped from the Amazon Warehouse and I am very pleased with this purchase."
"Apple",4,"The shipping on the phone was fast and timely. The phone works well, but acts slow sometimes. It is missing a screw. Other than those small things everything is cool."
"Apple",4,"IPhone 4 is pretty good.. However many features which are added in ios6 are not available for iPhone4. I don't see any real reason as hardware for many of the features. So little disappointed with that."
"Apple",4,"THIS PHONE IS EN PERFECT CONDITIONS, ONE THING, THIS PHONE SENT ME WITHOUT A BOX. I DIDN'T LIKE IT BUT EVERYTHING WAS OK, IT'S LIKE NEW. I REALLY LOVE IT"
"Apple",4,"Loving my phone. Was even better with Siri, but I lose her with the upgrade, could hardly wait for the new jailbreak to get her back. I suggest if you intend to sell your phones again take Advantage of the protective covers. Sense this I have gotten a number of items through Amazon"
"Apple",5,"I have one and my son had to have one. I have been supporting Apple since 1983 and they now have all #1 products. The nice thing about this is you have lots of options with AT&T. We use the pay as you go plan, no 3g and we get online at hot spots which are everywhere these days. No need to spend that extra cash if you don't need to. The 4 still is new enough to get all of the upgrades from Apple too. All that I can say is that it is a great phone or as I sometimes call it my mini ipad. I use it more than I use my computer these days. I will make one recommendation, if you buy one, get ""The Otter Box case"" as it will save your phone from lots of damage and breakage.Apple iPhone 4 16GB (Black) - AT&TAfter 3 weeks the camera stopped working and music would go on and off and loose calls left and rightI am sending it back"
"Apple",5,"This is very good iPhone . When I bought. I didn't realize that was goodbut I take a chance to buy when I receive it, it was very good and comewith the box and with a complete accessories . I am very satisfy."
"Apple",5,"well I've been using this iphone for 10days now no issues occured on my phone, I did managed to get it factory ulnocked ^_^"
"Apple",1,"I bring this iPhone 4 to Shanghai for gift, but in Shanghai dose not work, looks like was locked! So I have to bring back to US to unlocked!"
"Apple",2,"battery failed after 7 months"
"Apple",5,"I am glad that I purchased this product. This product has served me well so far.I recommend it to everyone."
"Apple",1,"I bought this refurbished phone for my daughter for Christmas. We'll it worked great until the 30 day warranty expired. After spending this kind of money not to mention the thousands of dollars spent with Amazon this was a total disappointment and recommend never to buy anything with Amazon that does not have a manufactures warranty . Shame on you Amazon!!!!"
"Apple",4,"It can run the newest iOS. No Siri but I do not much care about that. The disappointment is that is just 3G and does not support 4G. Responds well, has Face Time."
"Apple",5,"I bought this iPhone 2 years ago and I'm still using it it came like the info said and like the pictures I recommend anyone getting iphone 4 go hereI just now figured out the ratings and reviews sorry took so long get backWith everyone"
"Apple",5,"Went with an iphone 4 32gb when my ipod 5th generation video finally bit the dust. I can say that I'm very happy with this phone, the call quality, bluetooth quality, and music quality are all excellent. In addition I recently added a Paypal card swipe which is something I could not have done with my old phone.Very easy to get used to after a few days, and the battery life is astounding. Later model iPhones have a special feature with the recently released OS to sync with newer cars better. I might upgrade my phone if I ever get a new car, but for now the used iPhone 4 I have works great with my old car's aftermarket JVC stereo (purchased probably 4 years ago!) USB interface and I'm totally satisfied with my purchase."
"Apple",5,"This was my first time purchasing a phone on Amazon. Was pleased with the price and selection. Phone works well - have had no problems at all. Will definately use for future purchases"
"Apple",5,"can you help me to unlock it because it does not work in Venezuela. I await your prompt response thanks"
"Apple",3,"Everything is really good except the battery life does not last very long at all, had an iPhone 4 before this one and battery life was excellent but his one sucks"
"Apple",4,"good product"
"Apple",2,"Good"
"Apple",4,"Good"
"Apple",5,"bought this 4 for my husband since he liked mine so much and really couldn't pass on the deal that I got when opening up a Amazon credit card"
"Apple",5,"Good quality. Fast. No problems."
"Apple",5,"Excelente"
"Apple",1,"Unable to unlock"
"Apple",5,"Bought two for my kids Christmas present. They are going to be so happy. Looks brand new!!"
"Apple",2,"The phone in its self is amazing but the batteries messed up in both it won't stay charged for nothing and then you plug it in and I jumps the percent of the phone up like 10% like its not really dying"
"Apple",1,"Not long after purchasing this product it already is making me regret it. It randomly goes black and doesn't allow me to restart it or turn it back on. After reading the reviews about some users experiencing glitches and malfunctions I should have went with my gut and not purchased this product. Don't make the same mistake I did, you truly do get what you pay for."
"Apple",4,"The fineness also good, no problem on the phone functions.Official unlock also very cheap, about $ 1.Unlock the future is very easy to use."
"Apple",1,"its just stupid to have CDMA & GSM, worst idea Apple ever came up with. this sucks!! definitely going with windows phone now."
"Apple",3,"The only thing bad about the phone was that it had a sticky home button which was not stated when I purchased it. Super disappointing."
"Apple",5,"the phone is perfect. no scratches no cracks, nothing. it looks practically brand mew. thank you for this awesome phone!"
"Apple",1,"I bought this for my girlfriend for Christmas, who had been wanting an iPhone, for the longest time. I found this deal, and I was very excited to get it for her. I've had great experiences with the Amazon Warehouse, I've bought numerous games on here.Anyways, I went with my great experiences and bought the phone. I give the phone to her on Christmas Day. The home button does not work. After the phone is on for a long amount of time, the screen turns yellow.The worst part about it is, I have always bragged on Amazon's Customer Service. They've always done me right. This time, they did not. They basically told me to take it to an Apple Store. I paid $250 for this phone. I paid $250, for a working, functional phone, that was almost ""Like New"". Amazon has lost a lot of credibility among the online community, with lackluster service and promotions. They've definitely lost another customer with me. All I want is the phone replaced with a working phone, that my girlfriend can use. Is that too much to ask? A simple replacement?To anyone reading this, if you are looking to buy a phone, do not do it from these people. Save your money, and just buy it off Craigslist. I would love for somebody from Amazon to contact me and make good on this deal. I have always respected and bragged about this company. I will never, ever pay for Amazon Prime with the treatment I have received regarding this transaction.So Amazon, thank you for ruining my girlfriend's Christmas."
"Apple",5,"It was really like new!!! I baught it for my Brother-in-law, he is very happy with the phone. Very Good Deal."
"Apple",5,"Needed a replacement phone for my daughter This one made her very happy! Was received in as advertised condition. Fully functional. No noticeable scratches on screen, original plastic on back, and otterbox works great."
"Apple",5,"I wrote a previous review about this phone. It was not a 32GB as listed, but a 16GB. It was not unlocked either. After contacting Amazon, they did all that was necessary to correct the problem along with a full upfront refund before receiving the phone back. Thank you to Amazon for their hard work in the customer service department."
"Apple",1,"it can hardly be used,even it's Appearance looks good.but I'm in china now,I can't return it.i do not know who can help me."
"Apple",5,"Phone meet my expectations! I was scared @ first, but it was in excellent conditions and worth the money! <3"
"Apple",3,"Phone is in good condition but the home button doesn't work and there was no mention of that problem on the ad. Apple said they can replace or repair for a bout $140. Quick shipment, no problems other than that."
"Apple",5,"I bought this phone as I needed a really good and reliable phone. I had recently been diagnosed with breast cancer had surgery etc. When Is spoke to the seller of this product they assured me that they would work with me, and accept the return if need be. I was going from a regular SIM card to one I had to cut,. They even helped me with that!! They were awesome to work with and I am thrilled to say I have not had any problem with the phone at all!! It was in excellent condition, These are great people to deal with!!!"
"Apple",5,"Loved it like new . Phone came in factory box with brand new head phones and charger. I would definitely purchase another. No scratches"
"Apple",5,"This is my first iphone and even that I am missing my blackberry a bit, this is Great. I bought this from OneEye Mobile and everything was according to the product description. I received a brand new 32 gb iphone, with all the original accessories. As the description states this cell is locked to AT&T so you'll need an AT&T micro sim to activate the phone."
"Apple",5,"The person who sold it to was very polite and reputable, with everything that they said about the iPhone 4. Would buy from them again."
"Apple",1,"This phone didn't work. It did not provide service when I inserted my SIM card. I took it to the AT&T store and everything."
"Apple",4,"I bought this phone over 30 days ago and so, far so good. I was a bit leary about purchasing a used iPhone, but things worked out for the best with this product. It came unlocked and configured for ATT service as decribed in the add. There were NO scratches on the phone and it was packaged in the original Apple box with all the accessories included. It looks and works like brand new. This product definitely looks and works better than all the other used iPhones I saw for sale. Good luck!!"
"Apple",2,"if you want a 100% functional phone, don't buy this one. the phone arrives like a new, but the home button is not 100% functional. you have to push harder engough to make it work, it is annoying because you use the home button all the time."
"Apple",3,"The power button is sticky and it is slow. the touch screen takes multiple hits to get one app open."
"Apple",1,"I bought one Iphone,supossed to be new, with this seller and the Iphone came broken I took it to a guy to put my sim card in it and the guy told me that the screen had already been changed and that the Iphone already had contact with water. And today my Iphone broke and I can't make calls or receive, I can't access the internet or my messages."
"Apple",2,"The phone looks great but the home button does not work. I immediately contacted the seller and received no acknowledgement of my e-mail. I was able to adjust the settings on the phone to make it function. I am not satisfied with the seller at all."
"Apple",5,"this is my best bye of the year it is a brand new phone"
"Apple",5,"Came as described! Brand new and great"
"Apple",5,"excelente..."
"Apple",5,"super!!"
"Apple",4,"👌"
"Apple",5,"Arrived in new condition. Excellent!!"
"Apple",1,"IT BROKE TH 3RD DAY - HE POSTED IT AS NEW. IT WAS 4 YEARS OLD"
"Apple",5,"Awesome referbished phone. I would definitely recommend this to someone who's phone has been broken or stolen and is wanting a replacement iPhone. If you are inelidgible for an upgrade and do not have insurance, this is definitely the cheapest route. Great way of purchasing an iPhone at a discounted price."
"Apple",4,"Decent phone, about what I expected for a used phone. The battery life isn't as good as I hoped, and the screen is sometimes unresponsive, but overall it's what you ought to expect if you're not buying new."
"Apple",3,"The home button and on button don't work on this item which was not mentioned in the seller notes. Otherwise good purchase. Certainly worth the amount I paid for it."
"Apple",5,"Great price, great service! Ships quickly and as promised. Recommend highly. Excellent!"
"Apple",4,"was easy to transfer all info from old phone. works great. meets my needs..."
"Apple",5,"Couldn't be happier if it was brand new, works great. The camera is really awesome, takes great shots and is really fast with the next ""frame"". I could take 50 pics in 30 seconds with out having to wait like most cell phone cameras. Changing apps is very fast as well."
"Apple",5,"Good phone"
"Apple",2,"the phone was defective"
"Apple",5,"wonderful"
"Apple",2,"Received the phone inTack but the home key sticks."
"Apple",4,"THE ELECTION HAS BEEN GOOD, THE SELLER HAS GIVEN GOOD INFORMATION, THE PHONE IS WHAT I EXPECTED, GOOD PRODUCT"
"Apple",5,"I am finally in right there with all the other upgrades. I so needed this...!!! The phone is GREAT, it looks GREAT, it performs fantastically and I am very well pleased.. I suspected that this phone would turn out to be one of the better of my past purchases. However, IT'S REALLY THE BEST ! And it looks, feels and handles like NEW! What a difference. It's a really nice feeling to know that you've spent your money wisely. This purchase is truly an investment. Every one in a while, we all should ""treat"" ourselves to something nice. I GOT MINE!"
"Apple",5,"This is all I expected ! Works great looks new I got it on time and didnt have to worry about if it was a fake iPhone"
"Apple",5,"bought this for my brother. seems to be completely happy with it. it is an older version, but still serves it's purpose."
"Apple",4,"I ordered a black 32gb iphone 4 but got white instead. Phone didn't look touched and was factory unlocked as needed. The phone is very buggy..im not sure if it's the software that unlocked it or if that's just the iphone's quality. Either way im happy knowing I can use any gsm carrier whenever and have plenty of memory to last till upgrade time."
"Apple",1,"The phone was working fine at first but then we noticed cracks on the back of the phone . Then one morning i checked my phone and it was not turning on the only thing on the screen.was ios6 i took it to an apple store to see if they could fix the problem but they said it was a used item and there was replaced parts in the phone Along with missing screws. When i purchased the phone the statement said the phone was new thats the only reason why i had ordered it ."
"Apple",3,"I ordered this phone, thinking it practically new, but it ended up not even being the phone I wanted. It was the iPhone 4 in White, and it had a crack in it. Also, the battery lifespan was no good. I'm using it because I have no other option, but hopefully someone will call the seller out on it next time."
"Apple",5,"Opyou are the first person i bought a iphone from! I love this when i got it it looked like it was brand new! Even though it had scratchs i cant get over it!"
"Apple",2,"I received my phone on time, but, the phone has noticeable pixels that are moving on the bottom constantly. As if the phone had been broken at some point. Also, there was a circle of dim light cutting off the corners on my screen fully around the screen. Also, I had it brought to tmobile and found out that it was unlocked so that was a plus. THE WORST PART OF ALL WAS... I wasn't allowed to call people, my phone eventually after four months it stopped letting me call people. Another unfortunate error was that I couldn't send pictures to someone who didn't have an iPhone. So overall, you are better off saving your money and looking for a better seller, or goto an actual phone store. You really can't trust people online."
"Apple",1,"I hate suppliers who purposefully do not disclose things or who remain silent when they should announce it. If the Phone is LOCKED, SAY IT. This phone is not unlocked! I don't understand why anyone would pay $400 for a locked phone. Is anybody nuts to do that?This is the problem with Amazon all the time. Faulty and Inadequate advertising, in order to sell products. I would never pay full price for a locked phone because I want to avoid the hassle of going through hoops to get it unlocked. Phone manufacturers and wireless companies ask a million questions to unlock phones. If you can avoid the hassle of unlocking phones, you should because it ain't fun."
"Apple",5,"This Iphone 4 was right out of the box ""new"", not a scratch on it. Works just as if I brought it from Best Buy or At&T. My son loves it ,and the price was a great. No problems what so ever."
"Apple",1,"I received this iPhone 4 and checked it out as soon as i unboxed it, the screen was in perfect condition and the back of the phone was pretty good too only one scratch in the glass, i noticed that the white water damage stickers were removed out of the headphone slot and the charging port. I activated this phone and it worked very well until last night it started to randomly shut down on me and now it will not come on at all or charge!! I received this phone straight from amazon warehouse so i thought it was a safe bet, whats going on amazon??? we have to do better than this! $260 for a lemon."
"Apple",5,"The phone was in excellent condition just as stated..works wonderful..I'd recommend the iPhone 4 to anyway, it's great, love all I can do"
"Apple",5,"I LOVE MY IPHONE IT WORKS GREATE AND I'M GETTING A NOTHER ONE IN 30 DAYS, FOR MY FRIEND KIM"
"Apple",1,"Not a new phone. We ordered a new phone. We received a used phone. Per Apple the phone was previously registered."
"Apple",5,"i love the phone it is grate thank u so much i am happy that i got it an it was on time i do recommend it"
"Apple",3,"Sometimes Says No Sim When The Sim Is In The Slot & Is Inserted In The Phone . Phone Also Works Slow But Other Then That In Good Condition"
"Apple",1,"Sold the wrong color phone and was not an att phone like ordered. Had it two months and cant use it or unlock it. Very unhappy."
"Apple",5,"This was in great shape and just as it was described. Started right up, able to use the new operating system too! Got one for both kids!"
"Apple",3,"The phone is in really good cosmetic shape and the shipping was speedy, but what was not described was that the home button either does not function, or lags in response. We have had to download an icon app so that we can get to the home screen."
"Apple",2,"The Button at the bottom has to be pressed very hard to get the phone to work. I called the company and they said I would have to send the phone back. I did not have a back up phone so they said the only other thing they could do is refund me $35 out of the $289.00. I took it because I thought maybe it would pay to get it fixed but when I asked how much it would be to get it fixed they said starting at $64."
"Apple",5,"To all prospective Iphone lookers,When i was looking for an Iphone 4 for my friend as a gift, i almost ended up paying about 350$+ for new one. At last i thought about giving this one a try and i must say, its worth every penny.First of, it looks 95% new, let me emphasize on that number. Battery is great, Screen is spot/scratch less, i found maybe a hairline scratch on the side less than few mm long, almost invisible from few feets away. Being a past ATT user, i was able to unlock it for free in about 7 days.On the whole, it was one of best Refurbished/Used i have ever bought for anyone. Never been much of Used electronics enthusiast but this purchase might change my view for future.( Lets hope not ) :)Cheers!"
"Apple",1,"The item was listed as ""like new"", but there were some problems. First, the ear speaker's filter is missing. Second, camera's flash does not work. I cannot understand how they call this item as ""like new"". However, I received %40 discount after buying this item because of these problems."
"Apple",4,"Got good deal for 32gb, but home button did not work. Had to pay to change the button. Overall the phone works. Battery last only a day on standby."
"Apple",3,"It was good product but the accessories are not of good quality.the charger is not of good qualityphone has some issue like sound"
"Apple",4,"It is really good condition and looks new. I like it. and I will recommend to my friends. Good one!"
"Apple",5,"Works good  as the product was as it was described. Works great . I do not have ATT but straight talk and its does not make no difference compared to ATT"
"Apple",3,"It worked fine until i took pics with it. The back camera was scratched terribly. I had to pay 30bucks to change that."
"Apple",5,"Phones were great and strongly recommend this customer. I am looking forward to buy these more ,not sure if there are more in the back stock."
"Apple",5,"so good!it's just a new iphone.And the Black Friday price is also amazing.It would be better if iphone 5 could be sold, haha"
"Apple",3,"I ordered this for my boss and this product came very swiftly. Although some buttons aren't very responsive unless you press it down hard, there are no problems with the harddrive and it's how the item was described to be. He's happy with the phone and I would say this product and seller was very reliable."
"Apple",1,"Got this on time it was new worked perfectly fine. I would so recommend this to whoever would like it.(Update) I had the phone less than a year and i had some issues. I did get the phone flashed so it could work under another network. After having it for a few months people would call me and i would pick up i could hear them, but they were not able to hear me. So I took it to and iphone repair shop over three times, the replaced the microphone and it still didn't work. I gave up and switch to another phone. Money down the drain on this one."
"Apple",1,"Battery lasted 6 months... do not recommend. This phone has a problem with the screen touch. Many times, it will not recognize I'm pressing a button on the screen. However, it will constantly think my ear is a button. It's VERY annoying!. I don't recommend buying this phone from this company."
"Apple",5,"thanks for all, i like it"
"Apple",5,"Thanks!!!"
"Apple",3,"came as advertised."
"Apple",2,"Second phone I have purchased from Amazon..., This one worked two weeks before freezing up. I read all the reviews and chose to try again but was disappointed for a second time. Our phones make or break our business so not having usage for an hour can impact our lives. Amazon has always faired well with every other purchase we have made."
"Apple",5,"Phone came as expected, works great"
"Apple",4,"Its a good, working phone with minkmal cosmetic damage. One of the speakers does not work at all though."
"Apple",5,"Better than I expected upswapit is better company than chelseewood"
"Apple",4,"There was one major scratch on the front but all the buttons worked and shipping was faster than expected"
"Apple",1,"it was used and it glitches"
"Apple",5,"I bought my phone used as to avoid the 2 year contract and high prices of the major companies. We put the phone on Straight Talk and we are loving it."
"Apple",4,"I bought this used item though it doesn't look like used. Except that it has a minor scratch on the back which is unnoticeable. Device is working good but the charging cable looks like not the original one because it broke at the joint exposing the inner wire otherwise great product as expected."
"Apple",3,"Its an Iphone 4 and it was in very good condition, well packaged and delivered on time but I ordered an unlocked phone and the one I got was not unlocked. It cost me $100.00 more before I could actually use the phone."
"Apple",1,"The phone is great but I can not activate because there is a balance on the account it is linked too. Very frustrating."
"Apple",5,"i bought this i phone 4s for a very good price 204 $ itis locked but that is ok beause i paid 30 dollar to unlocked it and itworked great it is in a very good condition with no problem however it does not have any apps or programs i had to downloud every things but it still good for the price i have been using it for over a month and no problem yet i am super happy i defientely recommand it."
"Apple",4,"Amazon warehouse iPhone 4 for my wife cost less than my iPhone 4 purchased through Craigslist.The Amazon iPhone 4 was in better condition and a better $value than what I had purchased through Craigslist.Although the Craigslist iPhone OS software was already upgraded to 6.01, a major software upgrade requiringa complete re-install of all software APPS, iCloud, and Facetime.Amazon iPhone came with OS 4.2 operating system requiring that I perform the complete software upgrade, APPS,and settings reinstall myself, thus the 4 Star rating.If Amazon perform the OS software upgrades, I would have given them a 5 Star rating."
"Apple",3,"The charger is broken. I can only charge my phone through USB, which needs almost 8 hours to get battery full."
"Apple",5,"This product worked great for my birthday gift for my teenage son! High quality and arrived right on time! I really saved a lot of money in comparison to getting this same item at the store.Recommend it to anyone that is looking for savings all the way around on not just time but $$$.Regina"
"Apple",3,"the home key is not work!!the home key is not work!!the home key is not work!!how can i do?"
"Apple",5,"Even though the shipping was delayed it arrived in good condition just as described. Ive only been using it for a couple of days but so far everything is working just fine"
"Apple",5,"Great price,great phone"
"Apple",5,"I love this iphone it is great!!"
"Apple",1,"Don't be fooled when I opened the package I was super excited the phone looked brand new! The first day everything worked and seemed great then my phone would go black and turn off.also it would freeze and get super hot. There charger they supply you with does not work so for 266$ I feel was a big rip off don't be fooled be careful when buying a phone from companies like this and also AT&T had a hard time putting the phone ID in as well. Never again this product was a too good to be true!"
"Apple",1,"Phone doesn't get good reception. I have written to send it back and have received no comment back. It is the 4 of Sept. and must send it back by Sept. 6th. Not happy."
"Apple",2,"buyer beware I bought three phones from amazon three different phone one for att, one for straight talk and one for Verizon . they are all junk my att phone broke in three weeks, my daughters phone for Verizon has more problems than I can list is basically unuseable, and my sons phone which is the one I am reviewing works but freezes, hangs up and other stuff and he has had it about four weeks. So highly unlikely I got three lemons. right? DON'T BUY YOUR CELL PHONES FROM AMAZON THEY ARE GARBAGE!!!!!"
"Apple",4,"Heats up a bit when charging, but it's a great phone."
"Apple",3,"Works good"
"Apple",4,"Screen freezes a lot but other than that i love it"
"Apple",5,"very good...."
"Apple",4,"Works well"
"Apple",4,"Good used device. 80% good. Rare camera is not working. I showed it to I-Phone tech (iphoneaid.com) in Baltimore, MD. John fixed it in 15 minutes. Checked the I-phone and replaced the rare camera with new part. Thanks to Amazon and Iphoneaid.com"
"Apple",4,"Purchased an iPhone to replace a broken one and the new one works almost perfectly so far with the exception of the home button. It appears a bit worn down and I'm needing to push the button down hard 3 and 4 times to get the phone to respond. Other than that seems to be in very good shape."
"Apple",4,"its all great i swear works just like a new i phone 4s but the top power button does not work unless i hold it down for about three times which hurts."
"Apple",1,"This phone was reported stolen and is on the at&t blacklist and is blocked from network use. It doesn't work even for at&t like it said it would. I talked to an at&t personnel and she looked up the phone and it was reported stolen."
"Apple",1,"The phone I had ordered worked for about 3 months then started to glitch. I took it to the Apple Store to see what I needed to get repaired and the man told me that the phone was a imitation model of an iPhone, basically a phone made of random other parts programmed to work like an Apple iPhone. It eventually ended up crashing and not working at all. Just be careful when ordering techs on here."
"Apple",4,"Phone looks and seems to work wonderfully, however the phones was locked! Thus making me spend more money to get it unlocked... Besides that the shipping was VERY fast!"
"Apple",5,"The iPhone i ordered actually came a day earlier than it was suppose to . The phone is used but works brand new . I've had it for about 3 and a half weeks now and I have absolutely no complaints . I definitely recommend ordering from this Seller to anyone, very professional and prompt ."
"Apple",3,"We got this used and it works perfectly fine! It was nice that it came with a case and a screen protector! Nothing wrong that stood out."
"Apple",4,"I got the phone early and was able to resync all my apps in short time, I was very happy to be up and running again with this phone , Thank you for quick service,"
"Apple",4,"Nice device. If you are used to Apple lifestyle for sure you are gonna love this Iphone 4 I'll recommend it"
"Apple",1,"The phone was not new as stated it was defected when it arrive also car alarm pruchase did not work cause more than the item too send back"
"Apple",1,"He meet in a good way am happy about the phone is very good the person that use the phone use it in a good way"
"Apple",2,"Got the iphone a little bit early. They said it would be in perfect condition. Well the iphone came and I had to restore it. After I restored it, I tried to play music and one of the speakers doesn't work. The call volume is also very low. nobody can hear me forreal but I can hear them. it'll sound like my fone is breaking up."
"Apple",1,"Got the phone ahead if schedule, in the condition they described! But when I went to set it up, it came back stolen. I just don't understand how someone can sale stolen products! How do you not know??"
"Apple",3,"Fair over all..product work good no problem thank you I would grade you a plus. Of course I would recomended.."
"Apple",5,"I bought three of those iPhone as a gift. I know in the ads they said it is used.But they are in good quality, no cracks or any bad signs on any of them. The price was a bargain. I liked them so much that I placed another order for two more.Good communication with the seller too.ThanksOmaima"
"Apple",3,"Front screen is perfect, Lots of scratches on the back an home botton does NOT work. Other then that phone works well."
"Apple",2,"does not come in box that is bad not wash brings to insert the sim card and cash are not nuebo are usedotherwise and binding to and release for Latin America if it do not work"

"Apple",4,"I love the phone. It came exactly as described except the home button is sticking. Other than that, great product."
"Apple",5,"Excellent phone!"
"Apple",2,"Advertised as like new but not even close. The screen was filthy it looked like a toddler was playing with it while eating."
"Apple",5,"Arrived and worked just as expected."
"Apple",5,"good"
"Apple",5,"great product and great customer service!"
"Apple",5,"I love it thankx"
"Apple",4,"Phone is OK. Only problem is home button malfunction. I have to press extra hard for it to work."
"Apple",5,"Very good thank you"
"Apple",5,"I love it! so light"
"Apple",1,"I bought this phone and after a months of using it,it died on me i took it to the Apple store to have it fix and they told that my phone was faked...meaning amazon sell fake stuff for high prices."
"Apple",5,"Was just as I was hoping for. Good one to learn on. Thanks,"
"Apple",3,"the phone wasn't unlocked"
"Apple",1,"This phone was advertised as ""NEW"". When it died after 7 months, I found out through Apple it was refurbished. Vantage Cellular will not return my emails and Apple will not fix because I am not the original owner. DON'T TRUST VANTAGE CELLULAR"
"Apple",1,"this phone is rebuilt. not is new"

"Apple",3,"The phone is nice itself but it just don't stay hook to wifi it unhook itself 3 stars for the phone itself"
"Apple",4,"It wasn't as described. One of the speakers is blown."
"Apple",3,"Amazon hopes the sale of second-hand mobile phones to establish standards to limit certain unscrupulous businessmen shoddy second-hand mobile phones. I hope bad business to strictly enforce the Amazon proprietary standard used phones."
"Apple",1,"I placed an order for Iphone 4 AT&T lock and was delivered an IPHONE 4S Verizon Lock. I have travelled abroad therefore I can't return the IPHONE 4S Verizon Lock and latter I check for ESN and found that it had a BAD ESN. I am totally disappointed by this purchase. I am not able to replace this phone."
"Apple",1,"LOVED the phone, until I realized that the home button did not work. Could not make it go ""home"" no matter what I did. Was easy to return and get money back, But will NOT buy from this seller again. Phone was suppose to be in very good condition, would HATE it see what condition a phone in ""good"" condition would be like."
"Apple",1,"The iPhone 4 32 GB (Black) - AT&T was presented as ""Brand New"" and turned out to be NOT. An Apple store technician told me that it is a ""Frankenstein."" /ss"
"Apple",5,"For some reason, I returned the product after using it for a month, the product is good though.The full refunded me!"
"Apple",5,"This was exactly what I wanted and needed.It has worked nicely for me and couldn't help the great price of it."
"Apple",1,"the signal is super weak, the phone is out of signal most the time.The battery is ran out so quick and also the phone gets boiling hot just after 20 mins on calling.Often, the shop pauses by itself and you cannot return the home page.Definitely wasting my money on this phone !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
"Apple",5,"The phone was brand new in box new charger new and everything worked and still functioning well as we speak I'm on it now"
"Apple",3,"all very well and fast, and all this and that is described in the publication recommended for future purchases recommended 100%"
"Apple",5,"We haven't had much success with used apple products, but I decided to give it one more go. This phone is exactly as the seller described. It works beautifully. Most importantly, I have a very happy 15 year old whose iPhone 3 was seriously on it's last leg. Her favorite feature is facetime. :)"
"Apple",4,"It's OK. THe surface is very new. The speed and the baterry is Ok. I could not get its charge"
"Apple",5,"I just ordered the iPhone 4, it is my first time, so i'm really nervous about it, i'm hoping that it does not come in with defects all over it. I really need it to be good cuz it's a present, just like I said before` I really am hoping for the best. It's estimated to come on the 6th of December. So I'll let you guys know more about it once it comes in."
"Apple",5,"I really like the phone it is very easy to use and can be cusstomized to anyone with tons of aps avilable."
"Apple",5,"The iPhone was like other experiences with iPhone orders I have had with Amazon. Everything was perfect! The phone arrived exactly on time and was in mint condition just as the seller described."
"Apple",5,"I ordered this phone from AMazonvWharehouse for 218 bucks shipped. I figured it may be someones return. To my surprise, I noticed that it was BRAND NEW!!! New ones are going for 400+ on here, so I felt very fortunate. I love the phone, and have nothing bad to say about it. It's very sturdy, and is replacing my broken 3gs. I am psyched. Thanks Amazon!!"
"Apple",1,"Too Many scratches on the glass and on the sides, look one in craigslist or pay few more to buy a new one or a different model rather than this used phone. I'm totally disappointed after looking at this phone.I will return and better look for one on craigslist."
"Apple",3,"Unfortunately my experience was not entirely positive with the product. It arrived still wrapped in its box and looked beautiful. After I went to the AT& T store got its SIM card and was already to go, I found out that the home button only works occasionally. It is unfortunate for such a high priced item. I still love the Apple products but I am wondering whether buying direct from Apple or AT&T is cheaper and less hassle in the long run"
"Apple",5,"I have to say that i am happy with my iphone, i have received it and it was pretty much what the comments said about it!I am happy with the whole experience."
"Apple",5,"I needed to step into the smartphone world for work and my ATT plan was not up yet. I checked everywhere and Amazon had the best prices and the best guarantees. This phone was in superb condition and I am loving it!"
"Apple",3,"The volume of the incoming phone calls is too low. I need to use speaker to listen clearly to conversations."
"Apple",5,"Great deal, you can not go wrong purchasing from this site."
"Apple",5,"works and looks good"
"Apple",1,"Wi fi is bad"
"Apple",1,"I bought this phone to gift someone and the phone was horrible. The speaker was bad and the person whom I gifted was not able to hear the voice from other side. I tried to contact the seller but there was no customer service from the other end. We tried to take it to apple store to fix the problem they told us it is a used phone may be stolen. Stay away from this DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY LIKE I DID !!!!"
"Apple",5,"I am happy with my new phone, it was in new condition and no scraches."
"Apple",4,"Thank you"
"Apple",2,"Returned, did not work properly."
"Apple",5,"Very good"
"Apple",5,"very good"
"Apple",5,"So happy with this product! Would definitely buy from here again!!!"
"Apple",1,"Home button barely works fresh out of the box. Falsely advertised as new"
"Apple",5,"excelente, gracias"
"Apple",1,"not good bad condition."
"Apple",2,"i give it 2 stars because the battery lasted literally 2 weeks and then it would go dead after 30 minutes. and the phone wouldn't send texts if the phone was moving. had more problems but it is an i phone 4..... so i dont wanna bash. would definitely"
"Apple",2,"Order two and they died within a month And both had speaker problems"
"Apple",4,"It's better to text on than what I had"
"Apple",4,"Phone arrived on time and it was in great shape no scratches on screen. The charger we received with phone was cheap made phone act funny when using while charging"
"Apple",5,"GREAT BUY!!"
"Apple",4,"Good phone that state at real with aps"
"Apple",4,"Worked pretty well for a while but then started to slow down...."
"Apple",5,"I enjoyed this phone. It was in great condition and it works really well. I think that Amazon is a great place to purchase products because they have always treated me right. I would recommend Amazon to any body. It is convenient and I like it."
"Apple",3,"The price was good but the phone has much more scratches than I expected. The lense on the camara is so scratched that I cannot take a clear picture, also there was a sticker with the phone info stuck directly on the phone."
"Apple",1,"Waster 130 US to get this phone and its problematic . i spoke to the buyer before i purchased tha phone also"
"Apple",4,"just received it, didnt see any scratches as indicated. operates quick, charger cord appeared to be new, i plan on buying two more.."
"Apple",5,"I bought the phone for my teenage son for xmas and its awesome...no problems at all. Thanks so much he loves it!!!!!!!!!"
"Apple",4,"I love this phone so much it works great now but a few days after I got it it broke and wouldn't turn on so I took it to the apple store and now it works great"
"Apple",5,"Works looks and my wife is very happy with it. Thank you. She won't go any where with out it."
"Apple",5,"The phone was exactly how it was advertised, my son is very happy with this phone. Took it to AT&T and didnt have one second of trouble getting the phone activated for service. Minimal scratches and fast delivery. Awesome service"
"Apple",1,"Please send a very bad version. What is going on? What are you asking me again? Too bad the broken screens which use the blue lights. I asked for my money."
"Apple",3,"All I can say is I ordered the phone and it arrived on time. I gave it to my 13y/o daughter as a Christmas gift. As of right now, it is working just fine. I would recommend this to others."
"Apple",5,"awesome phone awesome seller!!!"
"Apple",4,"Phone did freeze and went completely black for hours but was still on contaced apple support to figure out why and they told me how to fix the issue hopefully it doesnt happen again the phone itself is in very good condition besides this incident"
"Apple",3,"I was excited to have gotten this phone in spring of 2013. I upgraded from an iPhone 3GS (yes I know I am behind on the times here). The phone carried so much memory and data that I was able to keep up with the new data downloads or whatever you call it. I never once had to erase or delete my apps and camera roll (as what I had to to do with my iPhone 3GS).Let's fast forward...I only used the phone for 11 months. Just right after I upgraded it to the new iOS (Spring 2014), my iPhone 4 acted up badly!! I couldn't get out of an app for how many times I hit the ""home"" button. It drove me crazy. And I couldn't even get into my call screen without having to hit home so many more times. I hated my phone because of the iOS that was downloaded at the time.I parted ways with my iphone4 (it was a sad moment) and left AT&T to be with Verizon.Verizon embraced me and got me the iPhone 5s. Yes it was a huge leap from the early iphone 4 to now an IPhone 5s (yea I felt like I was ballin' like a rockstar....until iphone 6 came out and then I ran out of memory on my 16gb iPhone 5s)....yea just because I left my iPhone 4 32gb for an IPhone 5s 16gb; I sure miss all those extra stored memory of my iphone4. It's not always greener on the other side. But damn that iOS upgrade that ruined my iPhone 4, otherwise me and the iPhone 4 would still be together no matter of upgraded phones I could've gotten. :("
"Apple",5,"Great phone! Fast delivery."
"Apple",1,"Phone died within 92 days. Took it to Apple and need to buy a replacement already. Would NOT buy from Warehouse Deals again."
"Apple",1,"the person you call can't hear you!!! had the phone for only a few weeks!!!"
"Apple",5,"Just got it thank you."
"Apple",4,"very good"
"Apple",1,"If I could rate lower than this I would. 4- 5 months later the phone started messing up. And now 8 months later it barely functions. I tried to contact the seller, without much help. After recommending I change the charger or restart it they have just stopped communicating. I give them an AWFUL review!! My phone was kept in an otterbox without any damage, whatsoever. And it has still managed to stop working. No sound anymore, therefore no alarm, no videos, no ringtone or text tone. The phone just shuts off for no reason at all. And does not come back on for several minutes or longer sometimes. I could go on and on about the problems."
"Apple",3,"I bought this phone 2 years ago and it worked perfectly fine but after a couple months of use the home button stopped working and eventually the lock button on top began to stick, I just sold this phone to buy a Samsung Galaxy Note 2 which is way better than this phone."
"Apple",3,"Device look good.But the processing is very slow.It hanged once.Then I took help of AT n T store to restore it by a hard restart.It is okay okaay."
"Apple",4,"Works pretty good my second 4 just wanted more space"
"Apple",5,"Good shipping, packages well and came with a power cord. Works great!"
"Apple",5,"nice phone, great shape"
"Apple",4,"Item was just as described. Thank you."
"Apple",1,"Product was sold as new, but was used. We found data from the previous owner. The phone freezes and has to be shut down and started again to get it to operate."
"Apple",3,"It's a good phone"
"Apple",5,"Good"
"Apple",5,"It's a good phone"
"Apple",2,"I'm fairly disappointed with this purchase. First off, the home button doesn't work very well as you almost have to pound on the button to get it to work. Secondly, I specifically purchased this listing because it claimed to be unlocked which was not true. Overall I am quite disappointed with this purchase."
"Apple",5,"THIS PRODUCT I RECIEVE FROM YOU IS AWESOME PERFECT AND I TRULY MEAN IT. THANKS, PLUS ITS NICE WORKING WITH YOU ! ! ! ! !"
"Apple",5,"Blown away. Not a scratch on it. Looks like a brand new phone. Came packaged just like a brand new phone. Performs like a brand new phone. Was marked ""like new"". But even better than that."
"Apple",5,"Update, the camera lens was not scratched, it had a protective film over the lens that we thought where scratches. The phone works great, and was worth the money we paid. Sorry for my ignorance."
"Apple",4,"Love the phone only 1 problem back camera doesn't work. Other than that I'm happy! Very reasonable price for what I received! Shipping was quick!"
"Apple",5,"I've never had an iPhone so this was a huge deal for me, I took the risk to get a used one and I do not regret it, the seller gave me the phone with 4 more cables besides the original, original box with documentation, earpods, wall charger and even a black case. The seller even gave me the apple store bag. Thanks Hollywood Studio Gems!"
"Apple",4,"The iphone is like new and it works perfect, The only complain is when I read the item it said that was unlocked but that was not true. I have to pay 27 box more to get it free...."
"Apple",3,"I received the phone sooner than i expected, no scratches, decent screen, so that was a plus. Unfortunately the phone itself was kind of dirty doesn't work at top notch status. The home button is malfunctioning, i have to press it extremely hard for it to function correctly (hopefully it won't become a problem). The phone works slowly. . The charger is bent but works so no problem there. Shouldn't be described as ""Like new"" because it wasn't ""like new""."
"Apple",5,"Shipped fast, packaged with ear buds, and power cord plus wall adapter. Looks beautiful, no nicks or scrape and functions great."
"Apple",4,"I recieved the product pretty quick, and its in good condition turns on and works great for the price I paid I am happy."
"Apple",5,"Use stuff are good stuff I dont regret buying this and I still have it using"
"Apple",5,"When we finally got this phone is was in great condition. Looked brand new!I bought it for my daughter and she was so happy! Everything works well no problems"
"Apple",4,"Product was in good condition but was kind of dirty and the speaker seems to be going out other then that I love it."
"Apple",1,"The item was sold as new, but when I received the phone it was easy to see that the phone had had its screen replaces. Not only that, the screen was poorly replaces and was moving. It was frustrating, since the item was supposed to be a gift, and so I had to find a different one at the last second."
"Apple",5,"Please I need to know how to find the key to download apps on my iphone 4 as Venezuela and buy it for when I go to the downloads me for a password and an ID"
"Apple",5,"Its affortable and there was nothing wrong with it at all; no damage, no scratches, nothing. A great buy. Thank you"
"Apple",5,"Phone came as described. And quickly. and they mailed it to my APO. Unlocked Via AT&T online chat. Works perfect for an older phone."
"Apple",5,"It is fit my desire. It is also an excellent phone which has most of applications. Apple Iphone 4 16GB (BLACK) work good it is easy to use and carry."
"Apple",2,"The home button doesn't work every few times, said it was like new which it is besides that. A little disappointed"
"Apple",3,"i started using the phone and it ok and stuff but the lock button did not work it came in a zip lock bag with a non working apple cable and i like it no other problem about it"
"Apple",5,"theres a lot of space to hold music movies and books along with having room for contacts, apps, and pics!"
"Apple",5,"Excellent !!!!"
"Apple",3,"The item was in fair condition. It showed signed was not the worst I saw but it showed signs of hard use. The price is reasonable though."
"Apple",1,"This refurbished phone was a piece of junk. Had to use speaker to talk to people and the home button didn't work."
"Apple",1,"We bought it and the seller said it worked well, and that was not the case. It constantly froze up and the battery did not last at all. Sorry I bought it because now it sits in my drawer because my parents could not use it."
"Apple",2,"item that arrived did not match discription fully. Was supposed to be a black phone, but back case was white. Phone did not work properly."
"Apple",4,"Phone did have a few scuffs on the screen and on the back but phone works fine."
"Apple",5,"I ordered this on the 18th of December and I asked them to have it delivered by Christmas and I revived it by the 23rd my daughter had a great Christmas happy happy happy"
"Apple",3,"The phone works.. But I am having some problems with it. When I push the home key it doesn't clear my screen right always I have to push it several time for it to clear.. My lock button is stuck and my volume key sticks.."
"Apple",3,"I loved this phone till it crapped out on me, got a new windows phone and love it more then the iphone will never go back to an apple product again Microsoft soooooooo much better people"
"Apple",5,"Bought for a teenage daughter who is extremely happy with it."
"Apple",2,"Not very good reception to phone and doesn't keep charge well. But in great condition exterior wize."
"Apple",2,"The battery Is horrible !! Dies within 20 minutes."
"Apple",5,"Its ok. Awsome. Is great for the price the only thing that was bad was the wall charger cube, it generated no charge just on and off. i had to charge the phone on a old charging dock station. Overall im satisfied. Will submit an update a review soon."
"Apple",3,"A lot of the apps that are out there now will not work with the older OS. The Iphone 4 is limited as to upgrades in OS as well. While I knew I was buying old technology I didn't realize that the apps were no longer available."
"Apple",4,"Great phone for the price."
"Apple",5,"Loved this phone. Mistake to do away with it"
"Apple",5,"great I just ordered the wrong one"
"Apple",5,"This was the first time I purchased a refurbished iPhone. It came in the original box and the cords looked brand new. The phone was in great shape and looked new also. I have not had any problems with this phone so far. I love iPhones and I like that this phone has 32 gb because I take a lot of pictures. I have not run out of room yet. I was really apprehensive about purchasing a refurbished phone but I'm glad I did. It saved me a lot of money buying it this way rather than a brand new phone. I wouldn't be able to tell the difference. It sounds great and runs perfectly like it is suppose to. I would defiantly purchase another refurbished phone again in the future."
"Apple",5,"Got this for my sister in law and she loves it!"
"Apple",1,"I bought this in February and im just now getting it the phone is cracked and it's white I ordered black be careful people"
"Apple",1,"this phone is in good condition but it dos not work properl the wi-fi is slow download is slow calling and texting is slow i would like to return it back and get my money back pleas"
"Apple",5,"this IPhone4 is very good,just like brand new.with a proper price,and I believe the quality of warehouse deals.hope next coorperation."
"Apple",5,"I was in desperate need of a new phone and this iPhone/seller was one of the best and highly rated ones I could find. I got my order right on time and the phone was perfect. Brand new just like the description said! I couldn't be happier right now. I will definitely be recommending this seller and product if anyone is looking for a new phone:)"
"Apple",5,"item described in like new conditionit was in better shape than my other iphone of the same modelwow, great sale"
"Apple",3,"I actually bought this for my brother and the description said used - like new but when it came, it wasn't i expected and the packaging was even not that good. I wasn't satisfied."
"Apple",5,"Llego antes de lo esperado el celular, muchas gracias.Recomiendo a este vendedor. . . . . . . ."
"Apple",4,"Just the home button does not work great. You have to push it kinda hard for it to work. Everything else works great though."
"Apple",5,"perfect! It arrived quickly and was exactly like the ad listed it. It works perfectly and I couldnt be more happy with it. Thank you"
"Apple",5,"I love this phone it is the greatest purchase ever! I recommend this phone to everyone but be careful of the seller you purchase it from I had to have a blank sim card in order to setup my phone to get the apple apps that came with the phone after my seller reset the phone."
"Apple",4,"este producto representa Precios competitivos, servicios de alta calidad, gran reputación, y esta en buenas condiciones que es lo mas importante."
"Apple",5,"Love it. It works like a charm. This product is highly recommended for anybody that is interested in it. Will buy again."
"Apple",1,"I can not unlock the cell. It was my fault. But none can unlock it. It was a very bad busyness."
"Apple",1,"Unfortunately I had to return it because it was defective. Very disappointed!This is the first time I receive an item in poor condition."
"Apple",1,"When it came it had been used before. I went to the apple store because it didn't work and when they looked up the serial number it had been pre owned ( it was advertised as a new phone)"
"Apple",5,"Bought this with Fulfilled by Amazon. We are happy. We are one month into ownership. It functions perfectly. It is used by a construction worker."
"Apple",1,"RUN FROM THIS SELLER AND DONT LOOK BACK, I bought this I phone 32gb and when I got it headed to the ATT store to activate the phone. Long and behold it would not activate, the sim card would not read. I was told to go to the APPLE store to see if they can figure it out which I did. It turns out that it was NOT A 32 gb iphone but a 16gb, the phone was a damaged phone and should have never been sold. THIS SELLER IS A BAD BUSINESS PERSON. RUNNNNNNNNN"
"Apple",5,"I thought i was taking a risk on buying this phone. But i wanted a 4 so bad. I read most of the reviews after i ordered the phone. I was worried until i recieved the phone early . In good condition and is working in good condition"
"Apple",3,"The phone itself isn't new. I received an iphone in decent condition but there were scuff marks around the sides, dirt in the volume buttons, and the home button doesn't work very well. Other than the minor ware, the phone is in fairly good condition."
"Apple",5,"I ordered the used phone and I was unsure how it look alike, good or bad. Wow! I was so happy when i received the phone. It look new and exactly what he described. I would like to recommend this vendor to everyone."
"Apple",1,"I bought a brand-new one of these, as opposed to the refurbished ones and I am returning it today. It worked for maybe two weeks and then it just stopped working. I couldn't open it up, so I took it to the Apple store and they said it was defective and there is nothing I can do. Since it doesn't have a warranty, they would give me another one for $143.00, if I wanted. I am really disappointed and now I am without a phone. Oh, also, the home key never really worked."
"Apple",5,"I love my phone. It came in the original packaging with all accessories. It was delivered when promised and was in the condition described. It was actually in better shape than I expected."
"Apple",4,"Having a great time using my iPhone! Just made the switch from android to apple and I have no complaints thus far!"
"Apple",5,"I have a positive feedback, I`ve got what I expected, the Iphone is in a good condition and I`m using it with pleasure :)"
"Apple",5,"What't difference between iphone 3gs and 4g?1. 4g has 512 mb RAM while 3gs has 256.2. 4g has new WiFi features , it's n generation while 3gs has older g generation.3. 4g has 1 GHz Cortex-A8 CPU while 3gs has only 600 MHz Cortex-A8.4. 4g has 5 MP camera with flash light and front camera while 3gs has only back camera 3,15 MP .5. Dimensions : 4g has 115.2 x 58.6 x 9.3 mm (4.54 x 2.31 x 0.37 in) while 3g has 115.5 x 62.1 x 12.3 mm (4.55 x 2.44 x 0.48 in) as you see 3gs is thicker and wider .6. Battery life:4g Stand-by Up to 300 h (2G) / Up to 300 h (3G)Talk time Up to 14 h (2G) / Up to 7 h (3G)Music play Up to 40 h3g Stand-by Up to 300 hTalk time Up to 12 h (2G) / Up to 5 h (3G)Music play Up to 30 hI think this is the main differences , of course there are some other differences too .I think it's best because you can change cracked screen cheaply and not only screen but back and other parts too."
"Apple",4,"I feel very good the whole process even today I have not received one month ago maybe by season, but all good thank god ..... just want to know if the iPhone is released internationally and if you send a code to unlock it."
"Apple",1,"I was showing the Iphone tu my nephew and then went blank and hot and no way to be turned of ... then it dies... I lost my money...I wish to have it back but how?>??/"
"Apple",5,"This product arrived quickly and I love it. akjfa al"
"Apple",5,"Great product, the phone was in great shape and has had no problems so far. No scratches or anything, looked almost new to me."
"Apple",5,"I wasn't sure of purchase, but when I received the iPhone I was glad to seethat the phone was as described. I would recommend this seller."
"Apple",5,"I would have thought it was new if the box was sealed. It was a great but and arrived promptly."
"Apple",3,"My iphone 4 arrived in excellent cosmetic condition. It was working fine functionally. But as time passed, I realized that the camera is not that good as it is suppose to be. Also, the home button became sticky after 1 month. I had to press it multiple times to get it to work.I have given it a 3 stars because of its features for the price that I got it for - $360."
"Apple",5,"This was a great deal on the phone. It works great and is exactly how it was described. Thank you so much."
"Apple",1,"Next Time you sell something you should have the box Sealed .When i got this product the Box Was Opened and it said New and you saidyou opened it to see if everything was in the box .Inside was a 16.Gb Phone Instead of a 32.Gb Phone .You tried to take me as a Skr."
"Apple",5,"I am not a HUGE Apple guy, but I can't imagine owning another phone! This one was a replacement for the iPhone 4 that I lost while traveling recently. My wife owns one of the Droid phones and she is NOWHERE NEAR AS HAPPY WITH HER PHONE AS I AM WITH MINE! I plan on keeping this phone until I NEED a new one!!!!"
"Apple",5,"That's good. Big to you thanks! I very much liked to be your client, I will surely use your services again."
"Apple",5,"That's good. Big to you thanks! I very much liked to be your client, I will surely use your services again."
"Apple",1,"The seller mentions that the iPhone is like new but it isn't. It have problem on middle button. Now the middle button doesn't work. The back side of the phone seems to me open before. I am really upset with this. I gift it to my friend and its make me a lot of horrible situation.And seller was helping me to unlock the phone that was good but why he didn't inform me the problem of this iPhone? Why he posted it Like new? Really disappointed:("
"Apple",1,"The piece that I received was not a refurbished as they said, it was a used one. I was not at all satisfied with the product and returned it back."
"Apple",2,"the back screen was all cracked but i didnt worry about that because the phone was used but what i am worrying about is how the phone only came with the charging chord and not the oulet part another thing is the chager dosnt even work so now i have wait till tomorrow to get a charger and hope it was the chager and not the phone overall not so good"
"Apple",4,"Bought this item for my father and he loves it and has already figured out how to load games on it...lol"
"Apple",1,"The dealer was fraudulent, claiming that the phone was new in the box. In fact, it was 3 years old, needed a new battery, and had a defective microphone. It cost $150.00 to replace it with a new iPhone 4 from Apple. Apple can tell you the history of the phone by it's serial number. Never buy from this dealer."
"Apple",5,"Son loves it I got it for him as a Christmas gift and he's very happy and the phone is still running strong! Love this thing!"
"Apple",5,"I give it 5 stars because its my first i phone 4 ever so all nice features keep it up apple company :)"
"Apple",5,"Great condition! In apple box with charger cord. There were no scatches too! This is a good option without a new contract as i wait for the i6"
"Apple",5,"I got this phone used. As advertised it had only minor scratches and it is totally functional. Great costumer support, answered within 1 day and really helpful!"
"Apple",1,"It's not working well you can hear but they don't so the phone it's not good that's why ahi give one star"
"Apple",4,"i purchased this iphone from the amazon warehouse and when i opened it, it looked brand new the only thing to complain about is the home button but that is not even a big deal. It also did take very long to ship and UPS is truly the most crappiest delivery company i've ever had to deal with. But other than that i am very happy with this purchase."
"Apple",5,"I wasn't able to afford a galaxy s3 or 4 or iPhone yet. I was so happy to see this deal. The used phone was pretty much new, no scratches working properly. The shipping was fast I just connected with AIO(great plan they have by the way). I am very satisfied. I haven't had no issues with amazon yet anyway. Love love the phone"
"Apple",5,"Our 1st time to order a cell phone on line. We've always gone into our AT&T store directly. This iphone is like new. No trouble getting personal contact info transfered and having the phone activated. Only wish we had ordered 2 phones from the same seller... Now I on the hunt for another great deal for our 2nd iphone 4s. Wish I could find more from A&Z. Thank You"
"Apple",1,"I ordered a new iPhone from ""One Time Cell"" last week and when I received my phone I noticed that it wouldn't get fully charged so I took it to the Apple store. They connected my phone to their system and told me that the phone had been used three years ago. I was obviously shocked because I'd purchased the phone under the assumption that it was new (I paid for a new iPhone). So I called Amazon and they refunded my money immediately and I reordered a new phone. I got the phone today and took it to the Apple store to make sure it was new but they told me that the serial number on this phone had been scratched and someone had been using it in the past. So I called Amazon AGAIN and they refunded my money AGAIN and I'm gonna return the second one tomorrow AGAIN. This was really frustrating and I never recommend this seller to anyone. Stay away from them."
"Apple",4,"Great condition as promised. I purchased it for my teen. Happy with purchase and function with the exception that the home button sticks sometimes."
"Apple",1,"I have years buying into this company, but I am very disappointed in this case, I wanted 2 iphone 4 released and sent me two ihpone 4 not work because it was not what I was offered. me and nobody can solve this problem. I'm just very disappointed and I do not expect this from a company like amazon. I have many friend who I had spoken ill of you, but no one learns from experience of others. could not recommend them more hurt and having to use another company for future purchases."
"Apple",5,"i love it"
"Apple",1,"The worst Apple iPhone I ever had."
"Apple",5,"Not a scratch on the product ,and shipped very quickly!"
"Apple",5,"Would recommend them to anyone. I washed them and they came out beautifully when I took them out of the dryer. You can tell they are high quality sheets."
"Apple",5,"it works I am very happy!"
"Apple",1,"no"
"Apple",5,"As discrived, on time, I contacted them, they crarified my concerns, and the phone works as I expected so far, Service was really good, the person was really great."
"Apple",1,"They say is new but is use ítem"
"Apple",5,"SInce this iphone 4 ,I have bougt 4,4s,5.But I think this generation is the most classic phone .Just as Jobs said ,it redesign cellphone"
"Apple",1,"i bought 2 of these. the phone was shown as unlocked. but it came as locked phone. the phone had scratches and one of them was poorly maintained."
"Apple",5,"its a good phone. I needed to get a new phone. so I found this one, only used 2 times. and its my baby. it may not be the lastest iPhone, but I love it."
"Apple",1,"I really didn't want an Iphone then to top it all off the Product was Horrid... It only Worked on Speakerphone... The Home Key Got Stuck.. I was very displeased!!! I wouldn't buy another iPhone to save My life!!!"
"Apple",5,"it is very good and so far I do not see much problem. it is easy to use. The battery is good."
"Apple",1,"I ordered two phones and one of the phones did not have an external sim port. Now i cannot return the phone which makes me feel sad."
"Apple",5,"I received my 'New' IPhone sealed in the box, contained everything you would expect in the box and works perfect! Great price for a very good phone."
"Apple",5,"The best phone I have ever had. iPhone the way to the future. I would recommend an iPhone to my friends"
"Apple",2,"The has a short battery life. I am constantly recharging. The phone take too long to power up. I am strongly considering selling it and get another brand."
"Apple",3,"The bottom center button often will not engage. When the button is pressed the phone often does not respond. I think that the button is dying. It is not working full.It is not the end of the world but a bit disappointing."
"Apple",5,"100 % ok"
"Apple",5,"power block for cord quit working 3 days later need to get ahold of them see if it can be replaced"
"Apple",5,"Love it, works great"
"Apple",5,"GREAT!!!!"
"Apple",5,"Loove my phone have no problems hardly no scratches and it's used. Would buy it again when the price is the same again"
"Apple",1,"Didnt work....the seller took it back with no questions...I will buy new next time!"
"Apple",1,"The aid said 16gb, but I got an 8gb? What's up with that.?"
"Apple",4,"I'm OCD and the phone came with a scratch right through the light for the camera. It doesn't affect the picture quality, but amazon said it was a brand new phone! Brand new phones don't have scratches!"
"Apple",5,"it's good to use. I like it."
"Apple",1,"This is the worst phone I have ever purchased or seen in my life. The camera does not work! It freezes and won't let you take a picture. I even brought it in to be fixed and the guy laughed at me and told me to return it as soon as possible. He said he could not fix it and that I should get my money back! Heads up.. Don't buy this phone!"
"Apple",4,"Seems to be perfect. I am satisfied with the purchase and seems to be in great cond. when shipped. A ok so far"
"Apple",5,"I'm still using the product today after losing my original and I was impressed by the details I got for the item which was all accurate"
"Apple",5,"The phone came just as he listed it to be. It is in perfect condition and is a great phone."
"Apple",5,"After reading some of the other reviews I was kind of worried it would not be in great condition, or it would have a big scratch or button that didn't work. That was not the case, the phone came in almost perfect condition, and after taking it to AT&T it was unlocked and I was up and running in no time.I am very pleased with this purchase, and the price was FANTASTIC!"
"Apple",5,"thks, i receive in costa rica, i need to unlock but i do with at&t in states without problems, thank you guys Im using internationally too and works great! love it"
"Apple",5,"some of those refurbish phone have being open to the guts, and some pieces replaced with different kind of chinese brands."
"Apple",5,"I purchased this iphone 4 16 GB as new. Upon receiving it there were issues with it. After contacting Second Cellular by email, I received a call within 10 minutes of the email and talked with Adam who was nothing but curtious and ready to make things right. He not only replaced the phone but upgraded it and sent it to me within 2 days at no extra charge. Wish I could give them 10 stars! Being a caregiver for my mom and in business, when my phone died I needed something fast and Amazon and Second Cellular came to the rescue. This company stands by its products and I will definitly use them again. I turned to Amazon and the top raiting of Second Cellular and gave not only my business but my trust and wasn't disappointed. You can trust you will get the product right with Second Cellular. Thanks Adam for a job well done! Stephanie (Atlanta/Florida)"
"Apple",1,"I purchased 2 Apple iPhone 4 phones from iDeal Expert last month: both looked brand new...but clearly, looks can be deceiving.From the start, one phone had a problem where the recipient heard a strong echo/distortion when speaking which interfered with the conversation. When I sent an email through Amazon clearly articulating the problem to the company, I received a brief response from their team: ""Have you tried calling the manufacture for an exchange?"".Considering my options, I decided to take my phone to an expert to see whether he could solve the problem. A couple of seconds after opening the case, he told me that the phone was not a new one, but refurbished. At a glance, he could see clear evidence of water damage, and it was missing all kinds of screws, fasteners..etc.I was horrified to learn this, and deeply troubled that iDeal Expert considers this acceptable practice - particularly given their supposed ""Complete Customer Satisfaction Guarantee: We stand behind the quality of our products with an iron-clad 100% guarantee. We are in the business of building long-term relationships with our customers, and we are confident that you will be satisfied with each and every purchase made from us. We offer an exclusive EZ NO-HASSLE RETURN POLICY. If for any reason you are not satisfied, simply send your product back to us for an immediate replacement or refund.""In my opinion, iDeal Expert has displayed a flagrant disregard of integrity and have manifest very poor business ethics and practice. I fail to see how such behaviour can lead to ""long-term relationships"", nor to fully-satisfied customers.If my experience is anything to go by, my strong recommendation to all potential purchasers is ""BUYERS BEWARE!"".UPDATE: shortly after my posting, I received an email from the iDeal Expert team as follows: ""This was bought in August, we are now in OCTOBER and cannot accept a return this is past 60 days and we will not accept a return."" I responded to correct their error - reminding them that I had in fact notified their team of the problem well within the time frame, and had even received their acknowledgement of that email.I remain deeply concerned that iDeal Xpert has not only sold defective goods, but then chose to use their 60-time period as an excuse for not dealing with the problem. I still fail to see how such poor business practices are deemed acceptable by the company.UPDATE #2: today, the screen of my iPhone 4 went blank...without any warning, nor any good reason. The phone is again back with my tech expert to try to resolve..."
"Apple",3,"I like my new phone it's just Some things about it i will have to get use to. Like my connection"
"Apple",2,"The phone sounds like I am talking in a tunnel. Nobody can ever hear me on the other line. Not to happy with this purchase."
"Apple",5,"Love it!!!"
"Apple",4,"It worked great!"
"Apple",5,"Use it as an ipod and a backup phone. For 80$ it is an awesome deal! Ipods cost 150+ and this does everything an ipod can do and then some."
"Apple",1,"I tried to use a different sim card, it wouldn't recognize it, I can't use this phone for anything"
"Apple",1,"Received a shotty battery with device."
"Apple",5,"I bought it for my mother-in-law and she loves it."
"Apple",4,"I got this for my son to get him started on the IPhone but without having to break the bank. It will last him a couple of years and then we can upgrade again. The product was brand new, works great and does everything he needs. The seller was prompt. It came right away."
"Apple",5,"Bought for my great grandsons birthday, excellent condition. Also include a case."
"Apple",5,"completely satisfied"
"Apple",5,"I ordered this device on Wednesday and it arrived 2 days later. That was very unexpected. I got everything it said I would except for the headphones. But I'm ok with that because Apples headphones aren't that great. Overall. A great experience. I would definately buy again."
"Apple",5,"Received the phone today and it looks brand new so far so good it is in good working order."
"Apple",4,"i love this"
"Apple",1,"Did not work with sim card"
"Apple",5,"I really appreciated the customer service I received from them. It was immediate and everything is now working. I am really enjoying my phone"
"Apple",5,"Brand new looking and all things working properly"
"Apple",2,"Looks and works great except for the fact that it won't work as a phone but like a iPod instead"
"Apple",5,"as described"
"Apple",3,"Phone works good. I bought used, it was scratched but oh well"
"Apple",5,"Great phone is there any warranty service let me know ty"
"Apple",5,"Best buy."
"Apple",5,"I bought my phone used as to avoid the 2 year contract and high prices of the major companies. We put the phone on Straight Talk and we are loving it."
"Apple",4,"I bought this used item though it doesn't look like used. Except that it has a minor scratch on the back which is unnoticeable. Device is working good but the charging cable looks like not the original one because it broke at the joint exposing the inner wire otherwise great product as expected."
"Apple",3,"Its an Iphone 4 and it was in very good condition, well packaged and delivered on time but I ordered an unlocked phone and the one I got was not unlocked. It cost me $100.00 more before I could actually use the phone."
"Apple",1,"The phone is great but I can not activate because there is a balance on the account it is linked too. Very frustrating."
"Apple",5,"i bought this i phone 4s for a very good price 204 $ itis locked but that is ok beause i paid 30 dollar to unlocked it and itworked great it is in a very good condition with no problem however it does not have any apps or programs i had to downloud every things but it still good for the price i have been using it for over a month and no problem yet i am super happy i defientely recommand it."
"Apple",4,"Amazon warehouse iPhone 4 for my wife cost less than my iPhone 4 purchased through Craigslist.The Amazon iPhone 4 was in better condition and a better $value than what I had purchased through Craigslist.Although the Craigslist iPhone OS software was already upgraded to 6.01, a major software upgrade requiringa complete re-install of all software APPS, iCloud, and Facetime.Amazon iPhone came with OS 4.2 operating system requiring that I perform the complete software upgrade, APPS,and settings reinstall myself, thus the 4 Star rating.If Amazon perform the OS software upgrades, I would have given them a 5 Star rating."
"Apple",3,"The charger is broken. I can only charge my phone through USB, which needs almost 8 hours to get battery full."
"Apple",5,"This product worked great for my birthday gift for my teenage son! High quality and arrived right on time! I really saved a lot of money in comparison to getting this same item at the store.Recommend it to anyone that is looking for savings all the way around on not just time but $$$.Regina"
"Apple",3,"the home key is not work!!the home key is not work!!the home key is not work!!how can i do?"
"Apple",5,"Even though the shipping was delayed it arrived in good condition just as described. Ive only been using it for a couple of days but so far everything is working just fine"
"Apple",4,"Great phone , but not a contract phone with AT&T"
"Apple",5,"A gift. Passed the grandson test."
"Apple",5,"Great!"
"Apple",5,"great phone"
"Apple",2,"Not happy!!!"
"Apple",5,"Got phone in 3 days! Great phone, very like new!"
"Apple",4,"Love it so far. The Home button doesn't work but the seller told me that at the very beginning. The assisted Home button (setting you have to turn on) works great."
"Apple",5,"goods"
"Apple",1,"this is one of the worst products i've ever bought from Apple ive had it encased in a otter box for protection and upkeep and it still regularly blips out. so far as the battery is concerned it regularly abruptly dies even if one moment before it reads 40-50% power, and the power button stopped working soon after i got it. do yourself a favor if you're considering apple for a phone just go with Samsung, LG, or something else. it's not worth the faulty poor quality and headaches this one will bring you."
"Apple",2,"The product was a huge disappointment. After a week of use, callers could not hear your voice when you called out on the phone. The only way to use the phone, as a phone, is with headphones. I do not recommend product and did not purchase the product just to be able to text."
"Apple",4,"It says just what you get in the mail, very nice and functional equipment, will definately recommend it ! Delivered a day late but no complaints."
"Apple",1,"Got this phone because my android smart phone would only hold a charge for 5 hours. On the plus side, this phone holds a charge for days, on the negative side, folks don't get my texts sometimes, or I don't get their texts sometimes, and it ALWAYS cuts my call off when I've only been talking for a few minutes. Must just be my particular phone, my daughter has one and has no problems with hers. I'm going back to my android smart phone. This one is garbage, sorry I bought it."
"Apple",4,"I fine this phone to be very well made, and it's loaded. I had a android phone before my iPhone, if I had to rate the difference I would pick this phone first. This phone is much more sophisticated, but people friendly."
"Apple",1,"The purchase of this iphone 4 has caused me so much hassle and waste of time. What a total regret buying this phone from ""mobilekarma"" Not only was it sold to me as a blacklisted phone, there's no way to get this iphone off the list. I had contacted mobile karma and they have no means to settling or solving this issue."
"Apple",1,"this phone is locked to another AT&T network and does not accept a USA AT&T sim card this is very frustrating"
"Apple",5,"My husband loves his phone.It was the perfect gift .Thank you I'm looking forward to finding more gifts for family"
"Apple",1,"This company seems like a joke to me, I got the phone but at least once a week I have to reset it. Like factory reset it. For the money I paid, shipping hassles I had, that is not worht"
"Apple",2,"This product arrived in box and with accessories that work! But we paid too much for this phone bc it continuously goes to the reboot screen! We are trying to find out how to fix this problem...but it is difficult!"
"Apple",1,"After spending an addt'l $100 to replace the broken glass, once service was activated, we found out the owner did not remove his personal information and in order for us to do it, we needed his password. After several conversations with the seller, at the end of the day, he would not provide his pass code thus the phone was useless."
"Apple",5,"My son wanted to be iphone nation but I had just switched carriers. So I was not going to pay full price for a new phone. Then I said let me look on Amazon.com. this phone did not have scratch on it. Perfect condition. My son loves it. Thank you. Money well spent."
"Apple",5,"good"
"Apple",5,"I haven't put it to use yet, but definitely 5 stars for receiving everything that was advertised was in the package."
"Apple",5,"Excellent!!! I bought it new and I use it in Guatemala, with no problem."

"Apple",1,"recivi the phone on May 19, I have three weeks to cell. and already I comenso to fail. I understand you buy a used phone, but poorly selling phones that do not work. the phone turns itself off, and now if not connected to the charger can not make or RECEIVE calls. very bad of this company selling cellular useless"
"Apple",5,"Nice"
"Apple",5,"Great product"

"Apple",5,"Nice & good condition."
"Apple",5,"I ordered a used IPhone 4 from this place and I am very satisfied with it. It barely has any scratches or tears just like the pictures. It came within a week, and when I went to activate it with metro pcs it worked perfctly. I am gad I got my phone from here, if I upgrade Im definitely using this place again."
"Apple",5,"beautiful"
"Apple",1,"i bought a cell phone that has a hardware problem, i sent it to repair to an official app store and they told me that i had been cheated by the seller...so think before buying to cell squad because it can happen the same to you!"
"Apple",5,"good"
"Apple",5,"I haven't put it to use yet, but definitely 5 stars for receiving everything that was advertised was in the package."
"Apple",5,"Excellent!!! I bought it new and I use it in Guatemala, with no problem."

"Apple",4,"Phone as arrived better condition than description. Happy :)"
"Apple",3,"thak you"
"Apple",5,"Arrived in condition as advertised. I did not have any problems with upgrade. Works and looks great."
"Apple",5,"We had a question about the iPhone and the dealer got back with us the same day we asked. They explain to us some items about the iPhone and our grandson is very satisfied with his new phone."
"Apple",2,"defective, had to send back"
"Apple",4,"Great purchase! It was as good as new... Screen was immaculate and had no surface scratched. I'm very satisfied with my purchase."
"Apple",3,"It's a great product for a great price. It was in good condition and arrived exactly on the day I expected it to."
"Apple",5,"My iPhone was bought from used powerbookmac.com & it is flawless no scratches or scuffs.i had my phone unlocked from third party vender(60 bucks).because they had no pervious owner info they buy then in bulk.but you can still unlock it through a third party vender. But all in all my iPhone is great the best phone I ever had. It's my first iPhone and for used the shot I took was right on the money. Fast, smooth, clean & crisp like an iPhone is. Buy from the vender if possible. They won't let you down. Item was as describe fast shipping they respond to emails, friendly service, plus only $94 for an used iPhone great deal great experience. A must buy.***** star rating"
"Apple",3,"One of the speakers on the phone doesnt work ,the sound is low"
"Apple",3,"The home button sticks bad. You have to push a few times hard to have it respond."
"Apple",5,"Great"
"Apple",5,"Great phone my son wanted a iPhone so I decided to go with the 4 until I know he can be responsible with it. Came the day it was suppose to unlocked no problem at all."
"Apple",5,"Thanks it work well"
"Apple",1,"This is my second one, and is really frustrating because i have to take it too have everything copied. I can hear other people on line, but they can not hear me sometimes."
"Apple",5,"I am in love with my new phone no marks looks brand new so far having no problems with it I got it in 1 day and I'm just very excited."
"Apple",1,"Only works with AT&T, no boostmobile no sim card"
"Apple",4,"It's very good"
"Apple",5,"It has all the features needed to make you totally dependent on it. Just try loosing one."
"Apple",5,"It was a pretty good item and not bad price it was a little scratched up but i can fix that easyly so"
"Apple",1,"It didn't work. The microphone wouldn't work half the time and the person couldn't hear me. Photos were unclear with lines across the screen!"
"Apple",1,"The phone does NOT work right, and never has. Sure, you can call out on it, and you can receive calls BUT ....no one can HEAR YOUR VOICE ... unless you switch the 'speaker phone' on! That part is not working right, and it has not since the day we received it. This was a gift for someone without a phone at all, and now she has one that only works halfway! NOT RIGHT! I've written the Seller already and now have submitted a claim via Amazon too. So far, the Seller is NOT returning emails or calls. Maybe Amazon itself will have better luck -- and if not, perhaps this store does not need to be an Amazon store at all.Let's see if they answer this, the THIRD request for replacement! A full replacement or even a full return of funds in the next 24 hours would certainly be welcome since we thought we bought a WORKING CELL phone. This one does not work right, period. we demand a replacement that works or a full refund within the next ten(10) days."
"Apple",5,"This is my first apple product ever. I had been wanting one for years but this was in my price range. A lot of my friends have the 5 or 5s and all suggested I start with the 4 since they feel the ios system is better on it. The phone I got was used, but looks near to new. Only a few extremely light scratches that you can't even see when looking directly at it."
"Apple",4,"For the price i paid the phone was in excellent condition! No scratches at all!!! All buttons worked great. Got phone activated yesterday with no issues. The only thing i didn't like was the amazon sticker was on the back of the phone and is VERY HARD TO GET OFF. Perhaps vacuum sealing the phone and putting the label on the plastic would be much better in the future. I cant scrape the sticker off due to the back being made of glass!"
"Apple",4,"It was fast and the shipping was minutes after I made the delicious to buy the phone, I was needing any phone cause I lost mine phone"
"Apple",1,"I need you to do the reverse in a gift card not refund my card because those dollars are the only ones I had and made me lose that money because in my country we do not handle that currency and it becomes very difficult to acquire and I think a irresponsibility on your part shall carry out, then q let her buy it so long to inform you could not sell the product then q I would like my money come back in a gift car so we can make a new purchase on this page thank you very much and expect an answer as this seems to me a grave lack of respect for my"
"Apple",1,"there were multiple issues with the phone that was supposed to be refurbished. this was the first product I purchased through here that I can say was a waste of money and I order a lot."
"Apple",1,"This is clearly the wrong phone and it would be excellent if whomever repackaged this actually looked at the box which clearly states VERIZON not what it was sold as AT&T. The irony here is these 2 different networks also use different carries AT&T is GSM and Verizon is CDMA. So this phone is a complete fail there too."
"Apple",4,"Only one speaker works and it's not unlocked... Other than that it works pretty good but just those problems. Yeah."
"Apple",5,"very happy with the phone it looks great and works well for me this is my first iphone and I will stay with it"
"Apple",5,"Looks like new, in addition to the HOME key is not sensitive. Good, service is also very good.Hope to continue"
"Apple",1,"I want to return because is not unlockHow can I do it?Please explain to me.Thank you so much."
"Apple",1,"Rated 1 Star because the description said GOOD quality, not an iPhone with a broken home button that doesn't work unless I jam it down. Will have to take to the Apple store for a fix, and could not return it to Amazon because of time constraints. Annoying."
"Apple",5,"This phone came quickly! It said it was ""like new"" and it seemed completely new--had the plastic on the front, etc. It had no scratches, etc. We ordered this phone for my daughter and she was totally excited. This came from the Amazon Warehouse and I would certainly recommend ordering from them. It included the headphones which was great also."
"Apple",4,"I wouldn't have minded buying a phone with a dysfunctional charger, but I would have liked to know what I was purchasing upfront. Luckily, the charger of the phone I'm switching fits this phone - if not, I'd be a very unhappy man with a new phone and no charger. I do want to say everything else was perfect, and I appreciate the price."
"Apple",4,"It came in the mail at a good condition, was a little disappointed the USB cable and the wall plug wasn't included but overall it is good"
"Apple",2,"i bought a new iphone online and the camera has a white shadow on the new phone and every pictures."
"Apple",5,"The unlocked iphone works great internationally. I purchase it for a 2-yr assignment in Brazil and have to say it worked well, never had an issue."
"Apple",4,"I purchased this with the honesty on the sellar that the phone was unlocked and it was not. It cost me additional $40.00 to get it unlocked."
"Apple",1,"The item was listed as ""like new"", but there were some problems. First, the ear speaker's filter is missing. Second, camera's flash does not work. I cannot understand how they call this item as ""like new"". However, I received %40 discount after buying this item because of these problems."
"Apple",4,"Got good deal for 32gb, but home button did not work. Had to pay to change the button. Overall the phone works. Battery last only a day on standby."
"Apple",3,"It was good product but the accessories are not of good quality.the charger is not of good qualityphone has some issue like sound"
"Apple",4,"It is really good condition and looks new. I like it. and I will recommend to my friends. Good one!"
"Apple",5,"Works good  as the product was as it was described. Works great . I do not have ATT but straight talk and its does not make no difference compared to ATT"
"Apple",3,"It worked fine until i took pics with it. The back camera was scratched terribly. I had to pay 30bucks to change that."
"Apple",5,"Phones were great and strongly recommend this customer. I am looking forward to buy these more ,not sure if there are more in the back stock."
"Apple",5,"so good!it's just a new iphone.And the Black Friday price is also amazing.It would be better if iphone 5 could be sold, haha"
"Apple",3,"I ordered this for my boss and this product came very swiftly. Although some buttons aren't very responsive unless you press it down hard, there are no problems with the harddrive and it's how the item was described to be. He's happy with the phone and I would say this product and seller was very reliable."
"Apple",1,"Got this on time it was new worked perfectly fine. I would so recommend this to whoever would like it.(Update) I had the phone less than a year and i had some issues. I did get the phone flashed so it could work under another network. After having it for a few months people would call me and i would pick up i could hear them, but they were not able to hear me. So I took it to and iphone repair shop over three times, the replaced the microphone and it still didn't work. I gave up and switch to another phone. Money down the drain on this one."
"Apple",5,"excelent"
"Apple",5,"great deal"
"Apple",5,"good"
"Apple",4,"It came on time. It works great.. Thanks"
"Apple",5,"Purchased it to use it as a secondary phone and it worked great. Now I only use it as a backup phone but I am glad I have a phone to go to in case of emergencies."
"Apple",1,"Was defective. The keyboard started messing up. I could hold my finger just over the keyboard but not touch it and keys would press on their own."
"Apple",1,"does not stay charged what a waist of money had to go back to my original phone not what I expected"
"Apple",5,"omg i am so happy i found this phone i had one and the on and off button quit working on me and i was searching amazon and found one just like it and i received it fast thankyou so very much for the fast shipping"
"Apple",1,"Don't work"
"Apple",5,"Good quality and good price"
"Apple",5,"Bought from Amazon Warehouse Deals. Phone came quickly, and I was surprised at the great condition it was in when I received it. The ""cosmetic damage"" was negligible to the point that it looked like a new phone, even though the condition was rated as ""good"". After a few hours of operation I noticed a significant problem with the home button and am sending it back. Going to try my luck with a different AWD iphone."
"Apple",3,"Send it to my girlfriend to the Philippines and spent more to have it activated I thought it was unlocked I should have just bought it over there"
"Apple",1,"SHIPPED A 16 GB WITH A FAKE PAPER PRINTED 32 GB LABLE WITH A BARCODE AND A IMEI NUMBER, TOOK IT TO APPLE AND CONFIRMED IT WAS A 16 GB, AND ATT CONFIRMED THE BARCODE WAS NOT THERES AS THEY DO NOT BARCODE THEIR PHONES THEY USE APPLES ORIGONAL, DO NOT BUY!!!"
"Apple",4,"So far I enjoy this device does everything I needed it to do. I would definitely keep shopping with amazon"
"Apple",5,"Product was in excellent condition. I ordered this to replace the not very user friendly android phone I had been using. I will never have anything but an iPhone from here on out."
"Apple",2,"Fast shipping the item scratch a lot honme button not working wel a camera is not clear need change len"
"Apple",4,"The phone is in great condition and didnt show much signs of wear and was exactly what i was looking for"
"Apple",4,"It is very nice, only issue is it cannot be unlocked due to it is non-full price of purchase. I was told before, if I bought at&t, i can use t-mobile prepaid card. but because of the price, i cannot. Otherwise, this is very helpful cell phone. can you tell me how to recharge the money for each month? which phone number to call for at&t prepaid card? thanks"
"Apple",5,"Wife love her phone"
"Apple",5,"I could not afford a new iPhone 5 so I opted for a used iPhone 4 and it has been excellent so far. The main reason I got it is because of the apps I can use while traveling, birdwatching etc. I used to fumble when answering my phone, but now it is a lot easier...with just a slide action I answer it. The ring on off button is easy to use. Going to 2 different emails is easy. I am learning to deposit checks in my bank account. No more lost checks!"
"Apple",5,"I got this phone for my grandaughter for Christmas. She loves it!"
"Apple",5,"thanks"
"Apple",5,"perfect"
"Apple",1,"this phone was sold as new worked for 3 mnths then stopped took it to the nearest apple store which was 3 hrs away for them to tell me it was a ""frankinstien"" meaning there were some apple parts an some that were not now NOBODY will help 300$ just gone"
"Apple",2,"It's not bad for the price, but there is lots of glitches in it! Another thing, it says it comes with a charger and it didn't! The only thing good about it is that it came quick!!"
"Apple",5,"Good"
"Apple",4,"Iphone came in very good condition as described, but the charger was not working well. I had to get a new one. Besides that, everything was ok."
"Apple",5,"A++"
"Apple",3,"Overall the phone works fine, but some of the buttons stick or don't work at times"
"Apple",2,"did not function well - very disappointed in the product. not as described."
"Apple",3,"no comments"
"Apple",4,"So far its being doing fine."
"Apple",5,"I believe I bought this used for my son and it was in great working condition."
"Apple",2,"I received the phone the day before I expected it and the condition was better than expected. But when placing phone calls the person on the other line can not hear you. I constantly breaks up. had to go back to old cell phone and looking to purchase another phone. the two stars are for the shipping time and appearance."
"Apple",5,"Was worried about buying a used phone. I'm very happy with my purchase. Looks and works great! Definitely recommend it!"
"Apple",5,"I love my new iphone, i arrived on time, nw i got all my apps onit. I can reach family and friend near or far"
"Apple",1,"Purchased this product as new. Proximity sensor failed. Apple support told me this phone was purchased in 2011and had no factory warranty. Company will not do any replacement after 30 days, so beware. I have a phone that I cannot use for phone calls. I will not purchase from these people as they state the product is new, but it is not!,"
"Apple",4,"Phone was brand new and worked great.. I also recieved it in 2 business days which was awesome because I paid for standard shipping..my only complaint is the price was a little ridiculous for an iPhone 4 so I'm rating the phone a 4"
"Apple",4,"Great phone"
"Apple",5,"Purchased several as gifts. They arrived on time and were in good condition as the Seller had described. Please note that none of these gift iphones were put on the carrier named. They went on the month to month plans offered at a major chain store that sold a package deal of buy the chip and get a month air time free. Many months later they are all working fine. And the low budget carrier service is even better than my personal 2-year contract carrier.I plan to purchase more of these as gifts soon."
"Apple",5,"awesome phone awesome seller!!!"
"Apple",4,"Phone did freeze and went completely black for hours but was still on contaced apple support to figure out why and they told me how to fix the issue hopefully it doesnt happen again the phone itself is in very good condition besides this incident"
"Apple",3,"I was excited to have gotten this phone in spring of 2013. I upgraded from an iPhone 3GS (yes I know I am behind on the times here). The phone carried so much memory and data that I was able to keep up with the new data downloads or whatever you call it. I never once had to erase or delete my apps and camera roll (as what I had to to do with my iPhone 3GS).Let's fast forward...I only used the phone for 11 months. Just right after I upgraded it to the new iOS (Spring 2014), my iPhone 4 acted up badly!! I couldn't get out of an app for how many times I hit the ""home"" button. It drove me crazy. And I couldn't even get into my call screen without having to hit home so many more times. I hated my phone because of the iOS that was downloaded at the time.I parted ways with my iphone4 (it was a sad moment) and left AT&T to be with Verizon.Verizon embraced me and got me the iPhone 5s. Yes it was a huge leap from the early iphone 4 to now an IPhone 5s (yea I felt like I was ballin' like a rockstar....until iphone 6 came out and then I ran out of memory on my 16gb iPhone 5s)....yea just because I left my iPhone 4 32gb for an IPhone 5s 16gb; I sure miss all those extra stored memory of my iphone4. It's not always greener on the other side. But damn that iOS upgrade that ruined my iPhone 4, otherwise me and the iPhone 4 would still be together no matter of upgraded phones I could've gotten. :("
"Apple",5,"Great phone! Fast delivery."
"Apple",1,"Phone died within 92 days. Took it to Apple and need to buy a replacement already. Would NOT buy from Warehouse Deals again."
"Apple",1,"the person you call can't hear you!!! had the phone for only a few weeks!!!"
"Apple",5,"Just got it thank you."
"Apple",4,"very good"
"Apple",1,"If I could rate lower than this I would. 4- 5 months later the phone started messing up. And now 8 months later it barely functions. I tried to contact the seller, without much help. After recommending I change the charger or restart it they have just stopped communicating. I give them an AWFUL review!! My phone was kept in an otterbox without any damage, whatsoever. And it has still managed to stop working. No sound anymore, therefore no alarm, no videos, no ringtone or text tone. The phone just shuts off for no reason at all. And does not come back on for several minutes or longer sometimes. I could go on and on about the problems."
"Apple",3,"I bought this phone 2 years ago and it worked perfectly fine but after a couple months of use the home button stopped working and eventually the lock button on top began to stick, I just sold this phone to buy a Samsung Galaxy Note 2 which is way better than this phone."
"Apple",4,"I would have kept this phone had it they allowed me to have updates past 7.1. Now Apple has updates for Iphone 4 users. I say get it if you need a cheap go-to smartphone."
"Apple",5,"Thank you, excellent product."
"Apple",5,"Great customer service.....highly recommend for phone purchases"
"Apple",1,"Apple ID was not taken off the phone."
"Apple",1,"Appearance as described, however damaged keyboard unable to log into WiFi or any of my accounts."
"Apple",5,"Everything is as described."
"Apple",5,"very happy with this phone"
"Apple",5,"Better than I expected"
"Apple",5,"Thanks I love it."
"Apple",5,"The phone was in perfect condition, works gr8"
"Apple",5,"I bought my phone used as to avoid the 2 year contract and high prices of the major companies. We put the phone on Straight Talk and we are loving it."
"Apple",4,"I bought this used item though it doesn't look like used. Except that it has a minor scratch on the back which is unnoticeable. Device is working good but the charging cable looks like not the original one because it broke at the joint exposing the inner wire otherwise great product as expected."
"Apple",3,"Its an Iphone 4 and it was in very good condition, well packaged and delivered on time but I ordered an unlocked phone and the one I got was not unlocked. It cost me $100.00 more before I could actually use the phone."
"Apple",1,"The phone is great but I can not activate because there is a balance on the account it is linked too. Very frustrating."
"Apple",5,"i bought this i phone 4s for a very good price 204 $ itis locked but that is ok beause i paid 30 dollar to unlocked it and itworked great it is in a very good condition with no problem however it does not have any apps or programs i had to downloud every things but it still good for the price i have been using it for over a month and no problem yet i am super happy i defientely recommand it."
"Apple",4,"Amazon warehouse iPhone 4 for my wife cost less than my iPhone 4 purchased through Craigslist.The Amazon iPhone 4 was in better condition and a better $value than what I had purchased through Craigslist.Although the Craigslist iPhone OS software was already upgraded to 6.01, a major software upgrade requiringa complete re-install of all software APPS, iCloud, and Facetime.Amazon iPhone came with OS 4.2 operating system requiring that I perform the complete software upgrade, APPS,and settings reinstall myself, thus the 4 Star rating.If Amazon perform the OS software upgrades, I would have given them a 5 Star rating."
"Apple",3,"The charger is broken. I can only charge my phone through USB, which needs almost 8 hours to get battery full."
"Apple",5,"This product worked great for my birthday gift for my teenage son! High quality and arrived right on time! I really saved a lot of money in comparison to getting this same item at the store.Recommend it to anyone that is looking for savings all the way around on not just time but $$$.Regina"
"Apple",3,"the home key is not work!!the home key is not work!!the home key is not work!!how can i do?"
"Apple",5,"Even though the shipping was delayed it arrived in good condition just as described. Ive only been using it for a couple of days but so far everything is working just fine"
"Apple",1,"The dealer was fraudulent, claiming that the phone was new in the box. In fact, it was 3 years old, needed a new battery, and had a defective microphone. It cost $150.00 to replace it with a new iPhone 4 from Apple. Apple can tell you the history of the phone by it's serial number. Never buy from this dealer."
"Apple",5,"Son loves it I got it for him as a Christmas gift and he's very happy and the phone is still running strong! Love this thing!"
"Apple",5,"I give it 5 stars because its my first i phone 4 ever so all nice features keep it up apple company :)"
"Apple",5,"Great condition! In apple box with charger cord. There were no scatches too! This is a good option without a new contract as i wait for the i6"
"Apple",5,"I got this phone used. As advertised it had only minor scratches and it is totally functional. Great costumer support, answered within 1 day and really helpful!"
"Apple",1,"It's not working well you can hear but they don't so the phone it's not good that's why ahi give one star"
"Apple",4,"i purchased this iphone from the amazon warehouse and when i opened it, it looked brand new the only thing to complain about is the home button but that is not even a big deal. It also did take very long to ship and UPS is truly the most crappiest delivery company i've ever had to deal with. But other than that i am very happy with this purchase."
"Apple",5,"I wasn't able to afford a galaxy s3 or 4 or iPhone yet. I was so happy to see this deal. The used phone was pretty much new, no scratches working properly. The shipping was fast I just connected with AIO(great plan they have by the way). I am very satisfied. I haven't had no issues with amazon yet anyway. Love love the phone"
"Apple",5,"Our 1st time to order a cell phone on line. We've always gone into our AT&T store directly. This iphone is like new. No trouble getting personal contact info transfered and having the phone activated. Only wish we had ordered 2 phones from the same seller... Now I on the hunt for another great deal for our 2nd iphone 4s. Wish I could find more from A&Z. Thank You"
"Apple",1,"I ordered a new iPhone from ""One Time Cell"" last week and when I received my phone I noticed that it wouldn't get fully charged so I took it to the Apple store. They connected my phone to their system and told me that the phone had been used three years ago. I was obviously shocked because I'd purchased the phone under the assumption that it was new (I paid for a new iPhone). So I called Amazon and they refunded my money immediately and I reordered a new phone. I got the phone today and took it to the Apple store to make sure it was new but they told me that the serial number on this phone had been scratched and someone had been using it in the past. So I called Amazon AGAIN and they refunded my money AGAIN and I'm gonna return the second one tomorrow AGAIN. This was really frustrating and I never recommend this seller to anyone. Stay away from them."
"Apple",5,"Excellent phone!"
"Apple",2,"Advertised as like new but not even close. The screen was filthy it looked like a toddler was playing with it while eating."
"Apple",5,"Arrived and worked just as expected."
"Apple",5,"good"
"Apple",5,"great product and great customer service!"
"Apple",5,"I love it thankx"
"Apple",4,"Phone is OK. Only problem is home button malfunction. I have to press extra hard for it to work."
"Apple",5,"Very good thank you"
"Apple",5,"I love it! so light"
"Apple",1,"I bought this phone and after a months of using it,it died on me i took it to the Apple store to have it fix and they told that my phone was faked...meaning amazon sell fake stuff for high prices."
"Apple",4,"The fineness also good, no problem on the phone functions.Official unlock also very cheap, about $ 1.Unlock the future is very easy to use."
"Apple",1,"its just stupid to have CDMA & GSM, worst idea Apple ever came up with. this sucks!! definitely going with windows phone now."
"Apple",3,"The only thing bad about the phone was that it had a sticky home button which was not stated when I purchased it. Super disappointing."
"Apple",5,"the phone is perfect. no scratches no cracks, nothing. it looks practically brand mew. thank you for this awesome phone!"
"Apple",1,"I bought this for my girlfriend for Christmas, who had been wanting an iPhone, for the longest time. I found this deal, and I was very excited to get it for her. I've had great experiences with the Amazon Warehouse, I've bought numerous games on here.Anyways, I went with my great experiences and bought the phone. I give the phone to her on Christmas Day. The home button does not work. After the phone is on for a long amount of time, the screen turns yellow.The worst part about it is, I have always bragged on Amazon's Customer Service. They've always done me right. This time, they did not. They basically told me to take it to an Apple Store. I paid $250 for this phone. I paid $250, for a working, functional phone, that was almost ""Like New"". Amazon has lost a lot of credibility among the online community, with lackluster service and promotions. They've definitely lost another customer with me. All I want is the phone replaced with a working phone, that my girlfriend can use. Is that too much to ask? A simple replacement?To anyone reading this, if you are looking to buy a phone, do not do it from these people. Save your money, and just buy it off Craigslist. I would love for somebody from Amazon to contact me and make good on this deal. I have always respected and bragged about this company. I will never, ever pay for Amazon Prime with the treatment I have received regarding this transaction.So Amazon, thank you for ruining my girlfriend's Christmas."
"Apple",5,"It was really like new!!! I baught it for my Brother-in-law, he is very happy with the phone. Very Good Deal."
"Apple",5,"Needed a replacement phone for my daughter This one made her very happy! Was received in as advertised condition. Fully functional. No noticeable scratches on screen, original plastic on back, and otterbox works great."
"Apple",5,"I wrote a previous review about this phone. It was not a 32GB as listed, but a 16GB. It was not unlocked either. After contacting Amazon, they did all that was necessary to correct the problem along with a full upfront refund before receiving the phone back. Thank you to Amazon for their hard work in the customer service department."
"Apple",1,"it can hardly be used,even it's Appearance looks good.but I'm in china now,I can't return it.i do not know who can help me."
"Apple",5,"Phone meet my expectations! I was scared @ first, but it was in excellent conditions and worth the money! <3"
"Apple",3,"The phone was claimed to be new but it was not & it had problems!"
"Apple",3,"Was kinda buggy"

"Apple",4,"The phone works pretty well, but I have had to bypass a button that allows you to change screens because it was sticky and wouldn't always work. I was glad to see that the phone offered this option, must be a common issue with older phones."
"Apple",1,"esuless"
"Apple",5,"Nice"
"Apple",5,"Just as advertised. Am enjoying the shopping experience and phone"
"Apple",5,"what can I say? I previously purchased an I phone from the AT&T. When I found out I had a $200 deductible to replace it, I got this one instead. Great phone. better price. Same phone."
"Apple",4,"good product"
"Apple",2,"Good"
"Apple",4,"Good"

"Apple",5,"Bought two for my kids Christmas present. They are going to be so happy. Looks brand new!!"
"Apple",2,"The phone in its self is amazing but the batteries messed up in both it won't stay charged for nothing and then you plug it in and I jumps the percent of the phone up like 10% like its not really dying"
"Apple",1,"Not long after purchasing this product it already is making me regret it. It randomly goes black and doesn't allow me to restart it or turn it back on. After reading the reviews about some users experiencing glitches and malfunctions I should have went with my gut and not purchased this product. Don't make the same mistake I did, you truly do get what you pay for."
"Apple",4,"Good."
"Apple",3,"Freezes a lot, also you can no longer pay to get att network switched to tmoible are vise versa. Very easy to crack, I ended up getting the iPhone 5 after cracking three 4s's in a year, and I'm much more pleased."
"Apple",5,"i was real impressed its just wat we ordered thanks so much"
"Apple",4,"Nice phone, however it was listed on a page that said 32gb. Must have been mistaken?"
"Apple",5,"Beautiful. Best phone I've ever had. Arrived with maybe two scratches. Is eligible for straight talk from Walmart which is a great deal. Never a loss of service. Excellent buy"
"Apple",2,"I like the phone but when I call somebody and I can hear them but they can not hear me. That sucks cuz I like to talk to people more than texting. Like I can't call work when I'm going to be late. I would have to text someone who going to work that day so they can say that I going to be late."
"Apple",5,"Good shopping"
"Apple",5,"Works great, clean, great condition."
"Apple",5,"5 stars iphone came & looks like new works great"
"Apple",5,"I am very happy with my phone. It actually came 2 days earlier than scheduled. It was in excellent working condition. I read a bunch of reviews before I ordered it. I was worried about buying used electronics. Something I never do. But, I'm glad I did. I saved alot of money and That's always a plus!"
"Apple",5,"Love it!!!"
"Apple",4,"It worked great!"
"Apple",5,"Use it as an ipod and a backup phone. For 80$ it is an awesome deal! Ipods cost 150+ and this does everything an ipod can do and then some."
"Apple",1,"I tried to use a different sim card, it wouldn't recognize it, I can't use this phone for anything"
"Apple",1,"Received a shotty battery with device."
"Apple",5,"I bought it for my mother-in-law and she loves it."
"Apple",4,"I got this for my son to get him started on the IPhone but without having to break the bank. It will last him a couple of years and then we can upgrade again. The product was brand new, works great and does everything he needs. The seller was prompt. It came right away."
"Apple",5,"Bought for my great grandsons birthday, excellent condition. Also include a case."
"Apple",5,"completely satisfied"
"Apple",5,"I ordered this device on Wednesday and it arrived 2 days later. That was very unexpected. I got everything it said I would except for the headphones. But I'm ok with that because Apples headphones aren't that great. Overall. A great experience. I would definately buy again."
"Apple",2,"Not very good reception to phone and doesn't keep charge well. But in great condition exterior wize."
"Apple",2,"The battery Is horrible !! Dies within 20 minutes."
"Apple",5,"Its ok. Awsome. Is great for the price the only thing that was bad was the wall charger cube, it generated no charge just on and off. i had to charge the phone on a old charging dock station. Overall im satisfied. Will submit an update a review soon."
"Apple",3,"A lot of the apps that are out there now will not work with the older OS. The Iphone 4 is limited as to upgrades in OS as well. While I knew I was buying old technology I didn't realize that the apps were no longer available."
"Apple",4,"Great phone for the price."
"Apple",5,"Loved this phone. Mistake to do away with it"
"Apple",5,"great I just ordered the wrong one"
"Apple",5,"This was the first time I purchased a refurbished iPhone. It came in the original box and the cords looked brand new. The phone was in great shape and looked new also. I have not had any problems with this phone so far. I love iPhones and I like that this phone has 32 gb because I take a lot of pictures. I have not run out of room yet. I was really apprehensive about purchasing a refurbished phone but I'm glad I did. It saved me a lot of money buying it this way rather than a brand new phone. I wouldn't be able to tell the difference. It sounds great and runs perfectly like it is suppose to. I would defiantly purchase another refurbished phone again in the future."
"Apple",5,"Got this for my sister in law and she loves it!"
"Apple",1,"I bought this in February and im just now getting it the phone is cracked and it's white I ordered black be careful people"
"Apple",4,"Great condition as promised. I purchased it for my teen. Happy with purchase and function with the exception that the home button sticks sometimes."
"Apple",1,"I have years buying into this company, but I am very disappointed in this case, I wanted 2 iphone 4 released and sent me two ihpone 4 not work because it was not what I was offered. me and nobody can solve this problem. I'm just very disappointed and I do not expect this from a company like amazon. I have many friend who I had spoken ill of you, but no one learns from experience of others. could not recommend them more hurt and having to use another company for future purchases."
"Apple",5,"i love it"
"Apple",1,"The worst Apple iPhone I ever had."
"Apple",5,"Not a scratch on the product ,and shipped very quickly!"
"Apple",5,"Would recommend them to anyone. I washed them and they came out beautifully when I took them out of the dryer. You can tell they are high quality sheets."
"Apple",5,"it works I am very happy!"
"Apple",1,"no"
"Apple",5,"As discrived, on time, I contacted them, they crarified my concerns, and the phone works as I expected so far, Service was really good, the person was really great."

"Apple",2,"Got the iphone a little bit early. They said it would be in perfect condition. Well the iphone came and I had to restore it. After I restored it, I tried to play music and one of the speakers doesn't work. The call volume is also very low. nobody can hear me forreal but I can hear them. it'll sound like my fone is breaking up."
"Apple",1,"Got the phone ahead if schedule, in the condition they described! But when I went to set it up, it came back stolen. I just don't understand how someone can sale stolen products! How do you not know??"
"Apple",3,"Fair over all..product work good no problem thank you I would grade you a plus. Of course I would recomended.."
"Apple",5,"I bought three of those iPhone as a gift. I know in the ads they said it is used.But they are in good quality, no cracks or any bad signs on any of them. The price was a bargain. I liked them so much that I placed another order for two more.Good communication with the seller too.ThanksOmaima"

"Apple",4,"I love the phone. It came exactly as described except the home button is sticking. Other than that, great product."
"Apple",5,"I have been looking for smartphone like this in Ages. I had a windows HTC before and this is my first iPhone. 32GB is almost like carrying a hard drive with you. The amount of things you can do with this is just amazing. Very useful and simple phone. I like it very much. Purchased from Amazon warehouse on sale like new and believe me it was more than like new. Still wrap in plastic and all. Very satisfied with this phone. I think I am iPhone convert now!"
"Apple",5,"I'm really enjoying my Iphone 4 and I didn't have to pay so much for it. Everything on it works fine and I'm so happy I found it on here first :)"

"Apple",5,"Pros:Nice storageVery nice designWorks flawlesslyIt just plain worksCons:NoneOverall: It does everything I ever wanted a device to do and more. IMO, Apple makes products that works so well that you don't even think about it."
"Apple",5,"I ordered a phone but upon receiving it, the screen would constantly flicker. It was brand new in manufacturing packaging so I'm sure it was an apple defect. I contacted the company and they were very attentive and worked with me. Best customer service I've received in a long time."
"Apple",3,"this iphone was worth the money i paid, it was cheap therefore i was expecting some sort of minimum malfunction, happens that the home button was a bit warned out but still workedno complains"
"Apple",5,"I was very skeptical about purchasing a used phone, especially an iPhone. But I found myself in a desperate situation to replace my old cell phone in a hurry. So I took a chance, hoping for the best, but expecting the worst. However, when I opened box I couldn't have been more pleasantly surprised.The device is not only in ""good"" condition, as described by the seller, it suprassed my expectations! There wasn't a scratch on it and it looks and works like new. And it even came with the free case as promised. The delivery was speedy. In fact the package arrived lot quicker than I expected. All in all, I am very happy with my purchase. I would highly recommend anyone to buy from this seller."
"Apple",1,"defective, did not disclosed was having problems, took it to apple and is not repairable, ended up buying new one, should have gone that route from the beginning, ended up paying him over 250 and for new one for 500.will not recommend to anyone for used iPhone, from internet"
"Apple",5,"muy bueno el articulo, se los recomiendo. y se puede liberar en Venezuela que es lo importante. son gente seria."
"Apple",3,"Device look good.But the processing is very slow.It hanged once.Then I took help of AT n T store to restore it by a hard restart.It is okay okaay."

"Apple",5,"Good shipping, packages well and came with a power cord. Works great!"
"Apple",5,"nice phone, great shape"
"Apple",4,"Item was just as described. Thank you."
"Apple",1,"Product was sold as new, but was used. We found data from the previous owner. The phone freezes and has to be shut down and started again to get it to operate."
"Apple",3,"It's a good phone"
"Apple",5,"Good"
"Apple",5,"It's a good phone"
"Apple",2,"I'm fairly disappointed with this purchase. First off, the home button doesn't work very well as you almost have to pound on the button to get it to work. Secondly, I specifically purchased this listing because it claimed to be unlocked which was not true. Overall I am quite disappointed with this purchase."
"Apple",5,"Great value"
"Apple",1,"PRODUCT IS NOT NEW AS STATED. PRODUCT IS REFURBISHED. Don't buy this phone from planet mobile. Mine had all sorts of problems right off the bat but I just dealt with them until after a few months when it completely broke same as another reviewer said where it only stays on for a few minutes and then a yellow or red screen flashes and it restarts. It stays at 1%. They said I couldn't return it because it was past the 90 days but that the manufacture warranty would still be good since all iPhones have a 1 year warranty. Well I checked and it was expired and Apple said the phone was purchased in 2010. I bought it in 2014. That means it is REFURBISHED NOT NEW the description is a lie but Amazon said I wasnt covered by the A to Z coverage because I didn't let them know the product was not as described in the first FOURTEEN days. I had no way of knowing it was refurbished because by all intents and purposes it was a new phone but it lasted just long enough to seem fine until it was too late to return. And I had no idea it was refurbished until I schedule the manufacture warranty as was suggested. I have tried to make continuous claims and they always say they understand but I always get denied thanks to the 14 days period I needed to respond. CHECK YOUR SERIAL NUMBER upon receiving it to see if your warranty is expired. Then you'll know it refurbished. I wish someone had told me that before I wasted my money."
"Apple",5,"Also"
"Apple",5,"excelente"
"Apple",1,"Went to our local store to activate the phone and discovered it was on the stolen phones list. Not happy."
"Apple",5,"Great."
"Apple",5,"My daughter said she likes it."
"Apple",5,"This iphone works great ! Nothing came cracked or misplaced . If your deciding to buy one , you could trust amazon ."
"Apple",1,"Phone doesn't work right at all, speaker doesn't work, can't restore phone. And the back came cracked"
"Apple",1,"After 3 weeks phone didn't work lots of problems not worth it . You could hear them but they couldn't hear you then in reverse. 1 out 23 calls would work if you were lucky . Don't waste your time or your money ."
"Apple",2,"Very slow and I am disappointed"
"Apple",3,"One of the speakers doesn't work.."
"Apple",5,"Amaising....thanks you...!!!!😉👌"
"Apple",1,"I received it in pretty good shape , but it does not work, can't make any calls or get any"
"Apple",3,"Would of liked a printed booklet of how to set things up.I am senor citizen & need to read something other than on just phone..Had to purchase ""how to book"""
"Apple",4,"The phone was in excellent condition and we have had no issues with it. The charger stopped working about a week later. Other than that I have nothing negative to say about our experience."
"Apple",2,"Had to get it fixed the next day"
"Apple",5,"Perfect!"
"Apple",5,"Still using it"
"Apple",4,"I love it . It was what I needed . thank you very much."

"Apple",5,"great phone"
"Apple",2,"Not happy!!!"
"Apple",5,"Got phone in 3 days! Great phone, very like new!"
"Apple",4,"Love it so far. The Home button doesn't work but the seller told me that at the very beginning. The assisted Home button (setting you have to turn on) works great."
"Apple",5,"goods"
"Apple",1,"this is one of the worst products i've ever bought from Apple ive had it encased in a otter box for protection and upkeep and it still regularly blips out. so far as the battery is concerned it regularly abruptly dies even if one moment before it reads 40-50% power, and the power button stopped working soon after i got it. do yourself a favor if you're considering apple for a phone just go with Samsung, LG, or something else. it's not worth the faulty poor quality and headaches this one will bring you."
"Apple",2,"The product was a huge disappointment. After a week of use, callers could not hear your voice when you called out on the phone. The only way to use the phone, as a phone, is with headphones. I do not recommend product and did not purchase the product just to be able to text."
"Apple",1,"worked for one day"
"Apple",5,"Love it"
"Apple",3,"My phone was supposed to be iphone 4s 32g but it jus iphone four and is only set up for ios 6 cant update or download versions of apps i used to have"

"Apple",5,"GREAT"
"Apple",5,"just what I expected"
"Apple",5,"Works perfect came in perfect condition thank you"
"Apple",1,"Does not work as advertised"
"Apple",5,"Great price,great phone"
"Apple",5,"I love this iphone it is great!!"
"Apple",1,"Don't be fooled when I opened the package I was super excited the phone looked brand new! The first day everything worked and seemed great then my phone would go black and turn off.also it would freeze and get super hot. There charger they supply you with does not work so for 266$ I feel was a big rip off don't be fooled be careful when buying a phone from companies like this and also AT&T had a hard time putting the phone ID in as well. Never again this product was a too good to be true!"
"Apple",1,"Phone doesn't get good reception. I have written to send it back and have received no comment back. It is the 4 of Sept. and must send it back by Sept. 6th. Not happy."
"Apple",2,"buyer beware I bought three phones from amazon three different phone one for att, one for straight talk and one for Verizon . they are all junk my att phone broke in three weeks, my daughters phone for Verizon has more problems than I can list is basically unuseable, and my sons phone which is the one I am reviewing works but freezes, hangs up and other stuff and he has had it about four weeks. So highly unlikely I got three lemons. right? DON'T BUY YOUR CELL PHONES FROM AMAZON THEY ARE GARBAGE!!!!!"
"Apple",4,"Heats up a bit when charging, but it's a great phone."
"Apple",3,"Works good"
"Apple",4,"Screen freezes a lot but other than that i love it"
"Apple",5,"very good...."
"Apple",4,"Works well"
"Apple",4,"Love my phone, the only complaint I have, was how it was packaged."
"Apple",3,"I have discovered they do not make Apple products like they used to...the top button locked up on the third day of having it."
"Apple",4,"came in good condition"
"Apple",3,"It's fine but the volume is really low when talking."
"Apple",3,"Good"
"Apple",5,"Perfect!"
"Apple",5,"A family member keeps breaking his phone. I didn't want to buy a brand new one. This re-furbished phone is working great and I couldn't beat the price."
"Apple",5,"Thanks so much I give you A++++"
"Apple",1,"its a use cellphone. thats not a brand new"
"Apple",4,"Returned it cause I needed a 4s"
"Apple",4,"Good used device. 80% good. Rare camera is not working. I showed it to I-Phone tech (iphoneaid.com) in Baltimore, MD. John fixed it in 15 minutes. Checked the I-phone and replaced the rare camera with new part. Thanks to Amazon and Iphoneaid.com"
"Apple",4,"Purchased an iPhone to replace a broken one and the new one works almost perfectly so far with the exception of the home button. It appears a bit worn down and I'm needing to push the button down hard 3 and 4 times to get the phone to respond. Other than that seems to be in very good shape."
"Apple",4,"its all great i swear works just like a new i phone 4s but the top power button does not work unless i hold it down for about three times which hurts."
"Apple",1,"This phone was reported stolen and is on the at&t blacklist and is blocked from network use. It doesn't work even for at&t like it said it would. I talked to an at&t personnel and she looked up the phone and it was reported stolen."
"Apple",1,"The phone I had ordered worked for about 3 months then started to glitch. I took it to the Apple Store to see what I needed to get repaired and the man told me that the phone was a imitation model of an iPhone, basically a phone made of random other parts programmed to work like an Apple iPhone. It eventually ended up crashing and not working at all. Just be careful when ordering techs on here."
"Apple",4,"Phone looks and seems to work wonderfully, however the phones was locked! Thus making me spend more money to get it unlocked... Besides that the shipping was VERY fast!"
"Apple",5,"The iPhone i ordered actually came a day earlier than it was suppose to . The phone is used but works brand new . I've had it for about 3 and a half weeks now and I have absolutely no complaints . I definitely recommend ordering from this Seller to anyone, very professional and prompt ."
"Apple",3,"We got this used and it works perfectly fine! It was nice that it came with a case and a screen protector! Nothing wrong that stood out."
"Apple",4,"I got the phone early and was able to resync all my apps in short time, I was very happy to be up and running again with this phone , Thank you for quick service,"
"Apple",4,"Nice device. If you are used to Apple lifestyle for sure you are gonna love this Iphone 4 I'll recommend it"
"Apple",5,"Great deal, you can not go wrong purchasing from this site."
"Apple",5,"works and looks good"
"Apple",1,"Wi fi is bad"
"Apple",1,"I bought this phone to gift someone and the phone was horrible. The speaker was bad and the person whom I gifted was not able to hear the voice from other side. I tried to contact the seller but there was no customer service from the other end. We tried to take it to apple store to fix the problem they told us it is a used phone may be stolen. Stay away from this DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY LIKE I DID !!!!"
"Apple",5,"I am happy with my new phone, it was in new condition and no scraches."
"Apple",4,"Thank you"
"Apple",2,"Returned, did not work properly."
"Apple",5,"Very good"
"Apple",5,"very good"

"Apple",2,"battery failed after 7 months"
"Apple",5,"I am glad that I purchased this product. This product has served me well so far.I recommend it to everyone."
"Apple",1,"I bought this refurbished phone for my daughter for Christmas. We'll it worked great until the 30 day warranty expired. After spending this kind of money not to mention the thousands of dollars spent with Amazon this was a total disappointment and recommend never to buy anything with Amazon that does not have a manufactures warranty . Shame on you Amazon!!!!"
"Apple",4,"It can run the newest iOS. No Siri but I do not much care about that. The disappointment is that is just 3G and does not support 4G. Responds well, has Face Time."
"Apple",5,"I bought this iPhone 2 years ago and I'm still using it it came like the info said and like the pictures I recommend anyone getting iphone 4 go hereI just now figured out the ratings and reviews sorry took so long get backWith everyone"
"Apple",5,"Went with an iphone 4 32gb when my ipod 5th generation video finally bit the dust. I can say that I'm very happy with this phone, the call quality, bluetooth quality, and music quality are all excellent. In addition I recently added a Paypal card swipe which is something I could not have done with my old phone.Very easy to get used to after a few days, and the battery life is astounding. Later model iPhones have a special feature with the recently released OS to sync with newer cars better. I might upgrade my phone if I ever get a new car, but for now the used iPhone 4 I have works great with my old car's aftermarket JVC stereo (purchased probably 4 years ago!) USB interface and I'm totally satisfied with my purchase."
"Apple",5,"This was my first time purchasing a phone on Amazon. Was pleased with the price and selection. Phone works well - have had no problems at all. Will definately use for future purchases"
"Apple",5,"can you help me to unlock it because it does not work in Venezuela. I await your prompt response thanks"
"Apple",3,"Everything is really good except the battery life does not last very long at all, had an iPhone 4 before this one and battery life was excellent but his one sucks"
"Apple",5,"Great!!"
"Apple",2,"I loved the service I received from Amazon, however, one of the speakers was blown on the Iphone."
"Apple",5,"I love it !"
"Apple",1,"the phone was not unlocked, I can not activate it for not having a sim card at & t"
"Apple",5,"Works great and good condition."
"Apple",2,"less than a year it lasted, of course I bought it used but guess it was a waste of money..."
"Apple",4,"Love it works great"
"Apple",3,"The home button doesn't work half of the time."
"Apple",5,"Even though the iPhone 6 will be out soon, I fell in love with this phone. The processor makes everything super quick, and even though non-market apps are much easier to obtain on an Android, I find that the versatility of the iPhone makes up for it"
"Apple",1,"this product is very bad the sound it's dosent work never"
"Apple",4,"For some reason people have a problem hearing me on this phone but I can hear them fine"
"Apple",4,"Phone is in realy nice condition. Only charging cabel broke down affter two weeks of using. I'm afraid it wasn't original. Skiping that everything works well."
"Apple",5,"Apple iPhone 4 32GB (Black) - AT&T ...worked just perfect"
"Apple",1,"Good"
"Apple",5,"Outstanding iPhone,like it.!"
"Apple",2,"Did not work properly, returned it for full refund!"
"Apple",5,"Excelent item, fast shipping, works great..5 stars"
"Apple",5,"Got this for my daughter and she loved it! The seller was great and tie this day my daughter is still using that phone. This was her first smartphone and I think its a good starter for anyone under 13."
"Apple",5,"delivered as advertised"
"Apple",1,"After 2 months the home button doesn't work. Took it to Apple to fix. They said it was out of warranty. Found out that it was a 2010 product. YUCKYUCKYUCK!Will cost $150 to replace/fix.Buyer Beware!"
"Apple",5,"I enjoyed this phone. It was in great condition and it works really well. I think that Amazon is a great place to purchase products because they have always treated me right. I would recommend Amazon to any body. It is convenient and I like it."
"Apple",3,"The price was good but the phone has much more scratches than I expected. The lense on the camara is so scratched that I cannot take a clear picture, also there was a sticker with the phone info stuck directly on the phone."
"Apple",1,"Waster 130 US to get this phone and its problematic . i spoke to the buyer before i purchased tha phone also"
"Apple",4,"just received it, didnt see any scratches as indicated. operates quick, charger cord appeared to be new, i plan on buying two more.."
"Apple",5,"I bought the phone for my teenage son for xmas and its awesome...no problems at all. Thanks so much he loves it!!!!!!!!!"
"Apple",4,"I love this phone so much it works great now but a few days after I got it it broke and wouldn't turn on so I took it to the apple store and now it works great"
"Apple",5,"Works looks and my wife is very happy with it. Thank you. She won't go any where with out it."
"Apple",5,"The phone was exactly how it was advertised, my son is very happy with this phone. Took it to AT&T and didnt have one second of trouble getting the phone activated for service. Minimal scratches and fast delivery. Awesome service"
"Apple",1,"Please send a very bad version. What is going on? What are you asking me again? Too bad the broken screens which use the blue lights. I asked for my money."
"Apple",3,"All I can say is I ordered the phone and it arrived on time. I gave it to my 13y/o daughter as a Christmas gift. As of right now, it is working just fine. I would recommend this to others."
"Apple",3,"Lasted a few months. It was good while it worked but then the phone turned off and never turned back on because the battery was bad."
"Apple",1,"phone worked great for 36 to 48 hrs and just shut off in the middle of a call and will not come back on"
"Apple",5,"The phone arrived in the time stated when ordered. It was packaged in a bubble wrap inside of an appropriate sized box to prevent any damage to the phone. They also included a charger and headphones (not the apple brand). The phone was clean without even a scratch on it. It looked brand new. AT&T was able to immediately add a line to the phone. I am planning on purchasing my mother the same phone and will definitely return to this seller if they have a white one available as I am truly impressed."
"Apple",4,"My mom liked it. The only thing is that the phone is locked. It costs about a hundred dollars for my mom to unlock it in China."
"Apple",5,"I bought this for my daughter and she loves this phone.She is able to use this phone overseas without any problemsJust what I was looking for"
"Apple",2,"The phone was in okay shape when I got it. The seller contacted me and told me that it was only a 16gb instead. But the description said it had been checked and was in working order. However, when I got it, part of the screen doesn't work. It wouldn't be a big deal (because I can rotate it from side to side) but many apps don't have that option so I can't easily use the apps because I can't use a portion of the screen. I have thought of the possibility of damage during shipping, but the phone seemed to be wrapped up well enough. All I can assume is that it didn't work when it was originally put in the mail."
"Apple",5,"Bought these phones for my brothers; received them in a very timely manner. No scratches, phones worked great! I definitely recommend purchasing from this user."
"Apple",3,"I like the phone but when I got it the lock button didn't work and the screen had line all on it. I wasn't pleased."
"Apple",5,"Hi, I bought this phone used and all together wit shipping it came out to be $133.00. This is the used black iphone4 16gb! Shipping was fast! To say this phone is used its in excellent condition. I mean i really almost tell that it was used. Seriously! I have service on it wit at&t and everything seems to work fine! The only lil nic is that the you have to push the home button kinda firm in order for it to work. Its not really a problem now and i just hope that it doesnt become one in the future! Over all Im satisfied!! This is great product for the price!"
"Apple",4,"I love the iPhone, the only thing because nw the Sim card is smaller,great devise I send it all the way to Jamaica and in the process of getting myself 1 ( Julie)"
"Apple",5,"THIS PRODUCT I RECIEVE FROM YOU IS AWESOME PERFECT AND I TRULY MEAN IT. THANKS, PLUS ITS NICE WORKING WITH YOU ! ! ! ! !"
"Apple",5,"Blown away. Not a scratch on it. Looks like a brand new phone. Came packaged just like a brand new phone. Performs like a brand new phone. Was marked ""like new"". But even better than that."
"Apple",5,"Update, the camera lens was not scratched, it had a protective film over the lens that we thought where scratches. The phone works great, and was worth the money we paid. Sorry for my ignorance."
"Apple",4,"Love the phone only 1 problem back camera doesn't work. Other than that I'm happy! Very reasonable price for what I received! Shipping was quick!"
"Apple",5,"I've never had an iPhone so this was a huge deal for me, I took the risk to get a used one and I do not regret it, the seller gave me the phone with 4 more cables besides the original, original box with documentation, earpods, wall charger and even a black case. The seller even gave me the apple store bag. Thanks Hollywood Studio Gems!"
"Apple",4,"The iphone is like new and it works perfect, The only complain is when I read the item it said that was unlocked but that was not true. I have to pay 27 box more to get it free...."
"Apple",3,"I received the phone sooner than i expected, no scratches, decent screen, so that was a plus. Unfortunately the phone itself was kind of dirty doesn't work at top notch status. The home button is malfunctioning, i have to press it extremely hard for it to function correctly (hopefully it won't become a problem). The phone works slowly. . The charger is bent but works so no problem there. Shouldn't be described as ""Like new"" because it wasn't ""like new""."
"Apple",5,"Shipped fast, packaged with ear buds, and power cord plus wall adapter. Looks beautiful, no nicks or scrape and functions great."
"Apple",4,"I recieved the product pretty quick, and its in good condition turns on and works great for the price I paid I am happy."
"Apple",5,"Use stuff are good stuff I dont regret buying this and I still have it using"
"Apple",5,"When we finally got this phone is was in great condition. Looked brand new!I bought it for my daughter and she was so happy! Everything works well no problems"
"Apple",4,"Product was in good condition but was kind of dirty and the speaker seems to be going out other then that I love it."
"Apple",1,"The item was sold as new, but when I received the phone it was easy to see that the phone had had its screen replaces. Not only that, the screen was poorly replaces and was moving. It was frustrating, since the item was supposed to be a gift, and so I had to find a different one at the last second."
"Apple",5,"Please I need to know how to find the key to download apps on my iphone 4 as Venezuela and buy it for when I go to the downloads me for a password and an ID"
"Apple",5,"Its affortable and there was nothing wrong with it at all; no damage, no scratches, nothing. A great buy. Thank you"
"Apple",5,"Phone came as described. And quickly. and they mailed it to my APO. Unlocked Via AT&T online chat. Works perfect for an older phone."
"Apple",5,"It is fit my desire. It is also an excellent phone which has most of applications. Apple Iphone 4 16GB (BLACK) work good it is easy to use and carry."
"Apple",2,"The home button doesn't work every few times, said it was like new which it is besides that. A little disappointed"
"Apple",3,"i started using the phone and it ok and stuff but the lock button did not work it came in a zip lock bag with a non working apple cable and i like it no other problem about it"
"Apple",5,"theres a lot of space to hold music movies and books along with having room for contacts, apps, and pics!"
"Apple",4,"It says just what you get in the mail, very nice and functional equipment, will definately recommend it ! Delivered a day late but no complaints."
"Apple",1,"Got this phone because my android smart phone would only hold a charge for 5 hours. On the plus side, this phone holds a charge for days, on the negative side, folks don't get my texts sometimes, or I don't get their texts sometimes, and it ALWAYS cuts my call off when I've only been talking for a few minutes. Must just be my particular phone, my daughter has one and has no problems with hers. I'm going back to my android smart phone. This one is garbage, sorry I bought it."
"Apple",4,"I fine this phone to be very well made, and it's loaded. I had a android phone before my iPhone, if I had to rate the difference I would pick this phone first. This phone is much more sophisticated, but people friendly."
"Apple",1,"The purchase of this iphone 4 has caused me so much hassle and waste of time. What a total regret buying this phone from ""mobilekarma"" Not only was it sold to me as a blacklisted phone, there's no way to get this iphone off the list. I had contacted mobile karma and they have no means to settling or solving this issue."
"Apple",1,"this phone is locked to another AT&T network and does not accept a USA AT&T sim card this is very frustrating"
"Apple",5,"My husband loves his phone.It was the perfect gift .Thank you I'm looking forward to finding more gifts for family"
"Apple",1,"This company seems like a joke to me, I got the phone but at least once a week I have to reset it. Like factory reset it. For the money I paid, shipping hassles I had, that is not worht"
"Apple",2,"This product arrived in box and with accessories that work! But we paid too much for this phone bc it continuously goes to the reboot screen! We are trying to find out how to fix this problem...but it is difficult!"
"Apple",1,"After spending an addt'l $100 to replace the broken glass, once service was activated, we found out the owner did not remove his personal information and in order for us to do it, we needed his password. After several conversations with the seller, at the end of the day, he would not provide his pass code thus the phone was useless."
"Apple",5,"My son wanted to be iphone nation but I had just switched carriers. So I was not going to pay full price for a new phone. Then I said let me look on Amazon.com. this phone did not have scratch on it. Perfect condition. My son loves it. Thank you. Money well spent."
"Apple",5,"excelent"
"Apple",4,"Received the device. It appears fine. But the design is so-so. It the phone fails from your hand, the front of the phone can break easily. I wish they had better design than this. I recommend to any body."
"Apple",5,"The phone was in a shrink sealed package as advertised. An excellent buy for my Granddaughter."
"Apple",1,"I purchased this for my grandaughters birthday and the day after i gave it to her it completely shot craps. it won't even charge, turn on or anything. she said it acted like it was throwing sparks before it stopped. I have sent it back to the company and still haven't heard anything or received an e-mail. I would like to have the Iphone replaced. I'm starting to feel very cheated and dissapointed. I can be reached by e-mail at phuber62@outlook.com or by phone at 618-286-4929. I would appreciate some sort of response to this matter."
"Apple",1,"This phone says in his description to be released and not receive this , your charging cable is damaged."
"Apple",4,"Have litte problem with spearck something"
"Apple",5,"The phone arrived in a timely fashion and met my expectations."
"Apple",4,"Acts up a lot !"
"Apple",3,"returned"
"Apple",5,"Phone is working perfect"
"Apple",3,"Phone looks very good. Does have some glitches. Sometimes it will not return to the home screen no matter what. Just have to wait ten minutes or so because when it's stuck it won't even power down but it will let you turn the screen off so at least it isn't draining extra battery. SIM card included was not as expected. The SIM card was disabled and useless. At&t set another for free but took almost a week to arrive. I could have bought same phone without sim card for nearly $15 less. Lesson learned but phone is in good shape."
"Apple",3,"good"
"Apple",5,"Is very good"
"Apple",1,"got phone and didn't work! wasn't even cleaned as i was pulling lint out plug in port"
"Apple",4,"Broke it, ran slow. Did what I needed it to do when I had it though. Lost my first one, so I got this."
"Apple",2,"The phone got very hot when charging. I'm requesting a full refund and a return shipping label. I do not expect to pay for return cost."
"Apple",4,"Yes it did"
"Apple",1,"the phone does not work!!"
"Apple",1,"I thought it was the S4 and it wasn't. My wife wanted the s so she's not happy it was a replacement."
"Apple",3,"its all right , the only problem with it is just like all iPhones is : the home button will partially stop working."
"Apple",4,"I have had iPhones since the 3G and always liked it. The last time I got a new phone I went with a GalaxyS3 and it was difficult to use, and was always using data plan that nobody could explain why I was going over. So I went online and bought this phone. I have been extremely pleased right from the beginning. The process was easy and it was here well within the time that was stated. I would definitely order from this person again."
"Apple",2,"Wifi did not work. Speaker mode did not work. Got to get a new one two months later. What a waist of money."
"Apple",3,"the product was Ok, but 'm not happy with the dealer, my stuffs was late 15 days and I had some problems to get it."
"Apple",5,"Love this phone! The merchant shipped it quickly. Packaged nicely. It came in a new white iphone box including the accessories listed plus instruction manual. Great price. I got it for a present for my 18 year old and it is in their hand all the time. I want to buy more from this merchant."
"Apple",4,"Was pretty please with this. It was brand new out of the box. I wasn't aware this was a GSM iPhone. Oh well. I mainly bought this to use as an iPod."
"Apple",1,"im returning this phone to Warehouse Deals, Inc. its so wrong to put up false advertisement. i thought that it was an ATT iphone but its not. be careful"
"Apple",5,"it was like new came in a box no scratches tht were visible to me me and my hubby both love our phones they work great"
"Apple",3,"The instructions are very difficult to follow. I was finally able to get the battery charged and at least turn it on. Now I'm still trying to get it connected to my telephone service so at least I can make calls. Next , I'm going to try to get some better on-line help in continuing with set-up procedures. I'll also have valuable help from my Son who is a Senior Computer Scientist and my Grandsons, all of whom are very computer and Smart-Phone knowledgeable. As a matter of fact, I'm pretty computer experienced myself having begun with the very first Apple II+ and a long career as a Professional Architect-Engineer with major Aero Space and Defense Corporations responsible for Scientific and Engineering computer systems.One way or another, I'll get this thing working yet!"
"Apple",5,"I just got my iPhone 4 and it looks pretty much new. I didn't know hat it was going to come with a charger and ear buds which is nice, I recommend this to anyone wanting a iPhone 4 that's in good condition at a pretty good price."
"Apple",5,"This is in great condition, looks brand new and works great. I've tried to acquire another one at this price."
"Apple",5,"SInce this iphone 4 ,I have bougt 4,4s,5.But I think this generation is the most classic phone .Just as Jobs said ,it redesign cellphone"
"Apple",1,"i bought 2 of these. the phone was shown as unlocked. but it came as locked phone. the phone had scratches and one of them was poorly maintained."
"Apple",5,"its a good phone. I needed to get a new phone. so I found this one, only used 2 times. and its my baby. it may not be the lastest iPhone, but I love it."
"Apple",1,"I really didn't want an Iphone then to top it all off the Product was Horrid... It only Worked on Speakerphone... The Home Key Got Stuck.. I was very displeased!!! I wouldn't buy another iPhone to save My life!!!"
"Apple",5,"it is very good and so far I do not see much problem. it is easy to use. The battery is good."
"Apple",1,"I ordered two phones and one of the phones did not have an external sim port. Now i cannot return the phone which makes me feel sad."
"Apple",5,"I received my 'New' IPhone sealed in the box, contained everything you would expect in the box and works perfect! Great price for a very good phone."
"Apple",5,"The best phone I have ever had. iPhone the way to the future. I would recommend an iPhone to my friends"
"Apple",2,"The has a short battery life. I am constantly recharging. The phone take too long to power up. I am strongly considering selling it and get another brand."
"Apple",3,"The bottom center button often will not engage. When the button is pressed the phone often does not respond. I think that the button is dying. It is not working full.It is not the end of the world but a bit disappointing."
"Apple",1,"This is my first return on Amazon and it appears to be very easy. As far as the product is concerned, its looks great but works terribly. Clearly a defect of some sort...all well, will return and purchase a new one"
"Apple",3,"I buy this second hand I phone 4 the looks is great but I'm just disappointed coz it won't work properly something wrong on calling somebody they can't hear me."
"Apple",1,"the description of the telephone was that it was a telephone released by to that buys it reason when arrives the telephone to me that him introdusco sim card does not serve because only it is possible to be used for AT& T deberia to demand it to sell articles that do not have a correct description if I wanted a telephone of AT& T I buy it to AT& T and not to a swindler"
"Apple",3,"The iphone 4 shipped quick and came with all accessories in the original packaging. The phone looked almost brand new but the home button did not always register. Ive heard that this issue is not that uncommon because lint and dust get trapped under the button. This was however a $315 phone listed as ""like new"" so I expected it to work flawlessly. This is my first amazon return but the process has been pretty easy so far."
"Apple",2,"i bought i phone 4 and this i phone supposed to be used like new but i surprised when i found the back camera is scratched and not working , really it was very bad"
"Apple",5,"WOULD LIKE TO KNOW IF THE IPHONE IS UNLOCKED ? I AM FROM VENEZUELA AND ME KNOW IF I WANT MY COUNTRY IS IN GOOD BUY IT NOW SO I HOPE YOUR ANSWER THANK YOU!"
"Apple",2,"The iphone 4 was unlocked is a problem for me I had to take and spend more than they should excuse my English"
"Apple",5,"My son had cracked his 3GS and some other things were not working well, so I bought this phone to replace his 3GS. He doesn't need Siri and some of the other features of the 4GS and 5, so I was ecstatic to find this new, unused iPhone 4 to replace his 3GS. The phone seems to be fine and set up was easy as we restored it from a back up of his 3GS and then he updated the operating system. I was worried purchasing it this way, but so far, so good!!!"
"Apple",3,"It did not come with a sim card and I had to go to a AT&T store to obtain one!"
"Apple",5,"The iPhone 4 was everything I thought it would be and more. It was actually an iPhone 4s and it was in absolute mint condition."
"Apple",4,"A light scratch on the back cover of the phone, otherwise I would have given all 5 stars. Rest looks almost new."
"Apple",5,"This phone is amazing for the price. My son broke his new zillion dollar samsung s4 or whatever. So, we got him a cool phone at at great (and maybe disposable) price.We will look to this shipper/store again if we need a phone."
"Apple",5,"It works like new and It even looks like it is brand new. I will shop here again real soon!"
"Apple",4,"This phone allow you to do anything you want to do. It's a mini computer in itself. Love my iPhone"
"Apple",4,"Phone works great! Like a new phone, only thing is my front camera stopped working which sucks but it works just fine!"
"Apple",4,"The phone looks pretty good, it works properly, I love it and I would probably get another one, I am very satisfied"
"Apple",5,"I had to replace my lost iPhone 4s. As a frequent eBay customer, the amazon product is clearly superior. The quality is guaranteed to be like new and the price is much less expensive. I am considering buying another simply to sell it on eBay for the profit."
"Apple",5,"Love it. It works like a charm. This product is highly recommended for anybody that is interested in it. Will buy again."
"Apple",1,"I can not unlock the cell. It was my fault. But none can unlock it. It was a very bad busyness."
"Apple",1,"Unfortunately I had to return it because it was defective. Very disappointed!This is the first time I receive an item in poor condition."
"Apple",1,"When it came it had been used before. I went to the apple store because it didn't work and when they looked up the serial number it had been pre owned ( it was advertised as a new phone)"
"Apple",5,"Bought this with Fulfilled by Amazon. We are happy. We are one month into ownership. It functions perfectly. It is used by a construction worker."
"Apple",1,"RUN FROM THIS SELLER AND DONT LOOK BACK, I bought this I phone 32gb and when I got it headed to the ATT store to activate the phone. Long and behold it would not activate, the sim card would not read. I was told to go to the APPLE store to see if they can figure it out which I did. It turns out that it was NOT A 32 gb iphone but a 16gb, the phone was a damaged phone and should have never been sold. THIS SELLER IS A BAD BUSINESS PERSON. RUNNNNNNNNN"
"Apple",5,"I thought i was taking a risk on buying this phone. But i wanted a 4 so bad. I read most of the reviews after i ordered the phone. I was worried until i recieved the phone early . In good condition and is working in good condition"
"Apple",3,"The phone itself isn't new. I received an iphone in decent condition but there were scuff marks around the sides, dirt in the volume buttons, and the home button doesn't work very well. Other than the minor ware, the phone is in fairly good condition."
"Apple",5,"I ordered the used phone and I was unsure how it look alike, good or bad. Wow! I was so happy when i received the phone. It look new and exactly what he described. I would like to recommend this vendor to everyone."
"Apple",1,"I bought a brand-new one of these, as opposed to the refurbished ones and I am returning it today. It worked for maybe two weeks and then it just stopped working. I couldn't open it up, so I took it to the Apple store and they said it was defective and there is nothing I can do. Since it doesn't have a warranty, they would give me another one for $143.00, if I wanted. I am really disappointed and now I am without a phone. Oh, also, the home key never really worked."
"Apple",4,"It's OK. THe surface is very new. The speed and the baterry is Ok. I could not get its charge"
"Apple",5,"I just ordered the iPhone 4, it is my first time, so i'm really nervous about it, i'm hoping that it does not come in with defects all over it. I really need it to be good cuz it's a present, just like I said before` I really am hoping for the best. It's estimated to come on the 6th of December. So I'll let you guys know more about it once it comes in."
"Apple",5,"I really like the phone it is very easy to use and can be cusstomized to anyone with tons of aps avilable."
"Apple",5,"The iPhone was like other experiences with iPhone orders I have had with Amazon. Everything was perfect! The phone arrived exactly on time and was in mint condition just as the seller described."
"Apple",5,"I ordered this phone from AMazonvWharehouse for 218 bucks shipped. I figured it may be someones return. To my surprise, I noticed that it was BRAND NEW!!! New ones are going for 400+ on here, so I felt very fortunate. I love the phone, and have nothing bad to say about it. It's very sturdy, and is replacing my broken 3gs. I am psyched. Thanks Amazon!!"
"Apple",1,"Too Many scratches on the glass and on the sides, look one in craigslist or pay few more to buy a new one or a different model rather than this used phone. I'm totally disappointed after looking at this phone.I will return and better look for one on craigslist."
"Apple",3,"Unfortunately my experience was not entirely positive with the product. It arrived still wrapped in its box and looked beautiful. After I went to the AT& T store got its SIM card and was already to go, I found out that the home button only works occasionally. It is unfortunate for such a high priced item. I still love the Apple products but I am wondering whether buying direct from Apple or AT&T is cheaper and less hassle in the long run"
"Apple",5,"I have to say that i am happy with my iphone, i have received it and it was pretty much what the comments said about it!I am happy with the whole experience."
"Apple",5,"I needed to step into the smartphone world for work and my ATT plan was not up yet. I checked everywhere and Amazon had the best prices and the best guarantees. This phone was in superb condition and I am loving it!"
"Apple",3,"The volume of the incoming phone calls is too low. I need to use speaker to listen clearly to conversations."
"Apple",3,"The home button and on button don't work on this item which was not mentioned in the seller notes. Otherwise good purchase. Certainly worth the amount I paid for it."
"Apple",5,"Great price, great service! Ships quickly and as promised. Recommend highly. Excellent!"
"Apple",4,"was easy to transfer all info from old phone. works great. meets my needs..."
"Apple",5,"Couldn't be happier if it was brand new, works great. The camera is really awesome, takes great shots and is really fast with the next ""frame"". I could take 50 pics in 30 seconds with out having to wait like most cell phone cameras. Changing apps is very fast as well."
"Apple",5,"Good phone"
"Apple",2,"the phone was defective"
"Apple",5,"wonderful"
"Apple",2,"Received the phone inTack but the home key sticks."
"Apple",4,"THE ELECTION HAS BEEN GOOD, THE SELLER HAS GIVEN GOOD INFORMATION, THE PHONE IS WHAT I EXPECTED, GOOD PRODUCT"
"Apple",5,"I am finally in right there with all the other upgrades. I so needed this...!!! The phone is GREAT, it looks GREAT, it performs fantastically and I am very well pleased.. I suspected that this phone would turn out to be one of the better of my past purchases. However, IT'S REALLY THE BEST ! And it looks, feels and handles like NEW! What a difference. It's a really nice feeling to know that you've spent your money wisely. This purchase is truly an investment. Every one in a while, we all should ""treat"" ourselves to something nice. I GOT MINE!"
"Apple",5,"Received the phone today and it looks brand new so far so good it is in good working order."
"Apple",4,"i love this"
"Apple",1,"Did not work with sim card"
"Apple",5,"I really appreciated the customer service I received from them. It was immediate and everything is now working. I am really enjoying my phone"
"Apple",5,"Brand new looking and all things working properly"
"Apple",2,"Looks and works great except for the fact that it won't work as a phone but like a iPod instead"
"Apple",5,"as described"
"Apple",3,"Phone works good. I bought used, it was scratched but oh well"
"Apple",5,"Great phone is there any warranty service let me know ty"
"Apple",5,"Best buy."
"Apple",5,"Was just as I was hoping for. Good one to learn on. Thanks,"
"Apple",3,"the phone wasn't unlocked"
"Apple",1,"This phone was advertised as ""NEW"". When it died after 7 months, I found out through Apple it was refurbished. Vantage Cellular will not return my emails and Apple will not fix because I am not the original owner. DON'T TRUST VANTAGE CELLULAR"
"Apple",1,"this phone is rebuilt. not is new"
"Apple",4,"Just as described. Works great."
"Apple",3,"Graet phone!! Excelent"
"Apple",1,"I bought this and 2 weeks latter it wont turn on."
"Apple",5,"Awesome phone absolutely no wear and tear perfect condition working awsomly and can put any sim from any carrier any phone (well as long as its a micro sim) and start using it on the spot very pleased..."
"Apple",3,"The phone is nice itself but it just don't stay hook to wifi it unhook itself 3 stars for the phone itself"
"Apple",4,"It wasn't as described. One of the speakers is blown."
"Apple",1,"The iphone came like in a week and a half and the screen came cracked and the iphone doesnt even work it stays on the apple"
"Apple",5,"It was a great phone I expected worse but came out to be something better. Really glad I made this purchase no regrets here."
"Apple",5,"I wanted the Iphone 4 without being attached to a contract with a carrier so I decided to buy on Amazon. I was so surprised when I received the phone. It was flawless; no scratches or dings looks like new. The phone works very well and came with the apple charger, apple ear phones, documentation, and apple stickers. It shipped from the Amazon Warehouse and I am very pleased with this purchase."
"Apple",4,"The shipping on the phone was fast and timely. The phone works well, but acts slow sometimes. It is missing a screw. Other than those small things everything is cool."
"Apple",4,"IPhone 4 is pretty good.. However many features which are added in ios6 are not available for iPhone4. I don't see any real reason as hardware for many of the features. So little disappointed with that."
"Apple",4,"THIS PHONE IS EN PERFECT CONDITIONS, ONE THING, THIS PHONE SENT ME WITHOUT A BOX. I DIDN'T LIKE IT BUT EVERYTHING WAS OK, IT'S LIKE NEW. I REALLY LOVE IT"
"Apple",4,"Loving my phone. Was even better with Siri, but I lose her with the upgrade, could hardly wait for the new jailbreak to get her back. I suggest if you intend to sell your phones again take Advantage of the protective covers. Sense this I have gotten a number of items through Amazon"
"Apple",5,"I have one and my son had to have one. I have been supporting Apple since 1983 and they now have all #1 products. The nice thing about this is you have lots of options with AT&T. We use the pay as you go plan, no 3g and we get online at hot spots which are everywhere these days. No need to spend that extra cash if you don't need to. The 4 still is new enough to get all of the upgrades from Apple too. All that I can say is that it is a great phone or as I sometimes call it my mini ipad. I use it more than I use my computer these days. I will make one recommendation, if you buy one, get ""The Otter Box case"" as it will save your phone from lots of damage and breakage.Apple iPhone 4 16GB (Black) - AT&TAfter 3 weeks the camera stopped working and music would go on and off and loose calls left and rightI am sending it back"
"Apple",5,"This is very good iPhone . When I bought. I didn't realize that was goodbut I take a chance to buy when I receive it, it was very good and comewith the box and with a complete accessories . I am very satisfy."
"Apple",5,"well I've been using this iphone for 10days now no issues occured on my phone, I did managed to get it factory ulnocked ^_^"
"Apple",3,"Phone is in good condition but the home button doesn't work and there was no mention of that problem on the ad. Apple said they can replace or repair for a bout $140. Quick shipment, no problems other than that."
"Apple",5,"I bought this phone as I needed a really good and reliable phone. I had recently been diagnosed with breast cancer had surgery etc. When Is spoke to the seller of this product they assured me that they would work with me, and accept the return if need be. I was going from a regular SIM card to one I had to cut,. They even helped me with that!! They were awesome to work with and I am thrilled to say I have not had any problem with the phone at all!! It was in excellent condition, These are great people to deal with!!!"
"Apple",5,"Loved it like new . Phone came in factory box with brand new head phones and charger. I would definitely purchase another. No scratches"
"Apple",5,"This is my first iphone and even that I am missing my blackberry a bit, this is Great. I bought this from OneEye Mobile and everything was according to the product description. I received a brand new 32 gb iphone, with all the original accessories. As the description states this cell is locked to AT&T so you'll need an AT&T micro sim to activate the phone."
"Apple",5,"The person who sold it to was very polite and reputable, with everything that they said about the iPhone 4. Would buy from them again."
"Apple",1,"This phone didn't work. It did not provide service when I inserted my SIM card. I took it to the AT&T store and everything."
"Apple",4,"I bought this phone over 30 days ago and so, far so good. I was a bit leary about purchasing a used iPhone, but things worked out for the best with this product. It came unlocked and configured for ATT service as decribed in the add. There were NO scratches on the phone and it was packaged in the original Apple box with all the accessories included. It looks and works like brand new. This product definitely looks and works better than all the other used iPhones I saw for sale. Good luck!!"
"Apple",2,"if you want a 100% functional phone, don't buy this one. the phone arrives like a new, but the home button is not 100% functional. you have to push harder engough to make it work, it is annoying because you use the home button all the time."
"Apple",3,"The power button is sticky and it is slow. the touch screen takes multiple hits to get one app open."
"Apple",1,"I bought one Iphone,supossed to be new, with this seller and the Iphone came broken I took it to a guy to put my sim card in it and the guy told me that the screen had already been changed and that the Iphone already had contact with water. And today my Iphone broke and I can't make calls or receive, I can't access the internet or my messages."
"Apple",1,"this phone is in good condition but it dos not work properl the wi-fi is slow download is slow calling and texting is slow i would like to return it back and get my money back pleas"
"Apple",5,"this IPhone4 is very good,just like brand new.with a proper price,and I believe the quality of warehouse deals.hope next coorperation."
"Apple",5,"I was in desperate need of a new phone and this iPhone/seller was one of the best and highly rated ones I could find. I got my order right on time and the phone was perfect. Brand new just like the description said! I couldn't be happier right now. I will definitely be recommending this seller and product if anyone is looking for a new phone:)"
"Apple",5,"item described in like new conditionit was in better shape than my other iphone of the same modelwow, great sale"
"Apple",3,"I actually bought this for my brother and the description said used - like new but when it came, it wasn't i expected and the packaging was even not that good. I wasn't satisfied."
"Apple",5,"Llego antes de lo esperado el celular, muchas gracias.Recomiendo a este vendedor. . . . . . . ."
"Apple",4,"Just the home button does not work great. You have to push it kinda hard for it to work. Everything else works great though."
"Apple",5,"perfect! It arrived quickly and was exactly like the ad listed it. It works perfectly and I couldnt be more happy with it. Thank you"
"Apple",5,"I love this phone it is the greatest purchase ever! I recommend this phone to everyone but be careful of the seller you purchase it from I had to have a blank sim card in order to setup my phone to get the apple apps that came with the phone after my seller reset the phone."
"Apple",4,"este producto representa Precios competitivos, servicios de alta calidad, gran reputación, y esta en buenas condiciones que es lo mas importante."
"Apple",1,"Home button barely works fresh out of the box. Falsely advertised as new"
"Apple",5,"excelente, gracias"
"Apple",1,"not good bad condition."
"Apple",2,"i give it 2 stars because the battery lasted literally 2 weeks and then it would go dead after 30 minutes. and the phone wouldn't send texts if the phone was moving. had more problems but it is an i phone 4..... so i dont wanna bash. would definitely"
"Apple",2,"Order two and they died within a month And both had speaker problems"
"Apple",4,"It's better to text on than what I had"
"Apple",4,"Phone arrived on time and it was in great shape no scratches on screen. The charger we received with phone was cheap made phone act funny when using while charging"
"Apple",5,"GREAT BUY!!"
"Apple",4,"Good phone that state at real with aps"
"Apple",4,"Worked pretty well for a while but then started to slow down...."
"Apple",4,"The phone does have some very minor cosmetic damage, you wont see it when the case is on and the home button is a bit stubborn but i'll change that soon."
"Apple",1,"I bought this used phone as a Christmas gift and when my wife got around to activating it, it didn't work. Now Amazon was top notch on getting me the cost of the phone and my shipping back but for some reason couldn't get my sales tax back? What kinda ship is that? A full refund is a full refund not a shipping and cost of the phone only refund! The girl who sold the phone had to of known that the phone was defective cause her so called return policy was like 1 or 2 weeks and that was roughly the shipping time. She acted like she had no clue it was defective and told me to bad it's not her policy to take stuff back after that time I should've told her sooner. Thank You Amazon for your standards I just wish that you would have gotten me a FULL refund!!"
"Apple",5,"they arived in time in APO adress-Afghanistan its nice to buy used iphones when they are in good care,without problems,working perfect,recived as described"
"Apple",4,"Good condition and love it, I recomend, Not the best deal $300 but its fair.I don't want any contract and new is too expensive"
"Apple",1,"I received this iphone yesterday but I can not use it..the home botton is not working...the seller said it was working perfect and tha is not true.."
"Apple",5,"Like the title says, Apple products rock! 32GB is currently proving to be more than what I need to store all of my music and apps. I also have a charger-case so my phone lasts throughout the entire day. The phone uses micro sim cards by AT&T as well as T-mobile. I am currently ordering a sim card cutter from Amazon in order to resize the sim card from Straight Talk because Straight Talk does not have micro sim cards anymore."
"Apple",3,"This phone had a few obvious scratches on the face, which were not described on the description of the device. However, it was the glitches thereafter that were disappointing. Within 2 weeks, the speaker function stopped working. I have had the phone since March 2013 and have issues with my 3-way calling feature. I have to turn the phone off...then back on for the conference calling function to work. Lastly, the volume button on the side that mutes the phone has malfunctioned causing the phone to ring when it should be silenced. We pay for what we get...and this used phone has made me leary of ever purchasing another one."
"Apple",5,"i love it its great and the pics are great its just want i wanted a great i phone 4 thank u it cane on time that's what i love about the seller was great and on time and i would order from this company again. thank u again"
"Apple",2,"The iphone 4 worked pretty good for 15 days but started acting up when I pushed the home button. It has 60% before I went to bed and at some point through the night it died. Very disappointed because this is my business phone."
"Apple",1,"I got it today.everything works great but when I make a call receiver can not hear me.Don't buy I would return it back as soon as possible !!!"
"Apple",5,"Excellent !!!!"
"Apple",3,"The item was in fair condition. It showed signed was not the worst I saw but it showed signs of hard use. The price is reasonable though."
"Apple",1,"This refurbished phone was a piece of junk. Had to use speaker to talk to people and the home button didn't work."
"Apple",1,"We bought it and the seller said it worked well, and that was not the case. It constantly froze up and the battery did not last at all. Sorry I bought it because now it sits in my drawer because my parents could not use it."
"Apple",2,"item that arrived did not match discription fully. Was supposed to be a black phone, but back case was white. Phone did not work properly."
"Apple",4,"Phone did have a few scuffs on the screen and on the back but phone works fine."
"Apple",5,"I ordered this on the 18th of December and I asked them to have it delivered by Christmas and I revived it by the 23rd my daughter had a great Christmas happy happy happy"
"Apple",3,"The phone works.. But I am having some problems with it. When I push the home key it doesn't clear my screen right always I have to push it several time for it to clear.. My lock button is stuck and my volume key sticks.."
"Apple",3,"I loved this phone till it crapped out on me, got a new windows phone and love it more then the iphone will never go back to an apple product again Microsoft soooooooo much better people"
"Apple",5,"Bought for a teenage daughter who is extremely happy with it."
"Apple",5,"it is a nice teleohone！when i uesed chinamobile sim card ，i found the iphone is unlocked。what a surprise！i really love it！"
"Apple",1,"Worst experience ever , ordered a 32gb , iPhone , they sent one that had serious design issues. They expedited another phone to replace it this time it was an 8gb iPhone , I am extremely disappointed and will be very cautious in the future using them to order items or reccommdnding then to others ."
"Apple",4,"Only problem is the home button and a few minor scratches but other than that the phone works perfectly fine!"
"Apple",5,"I PURCHASED THIS ITEM FOR MY HUSBAND AND EVER SINCE IT HAS NOT LEFT HIS FINGERS.LOVE IT NO PROBLEMS AT ALL."
"Apple",4,"iphone 4 is a great pjone . these reviews are what are stupid. you cant just give a rating and go on. NO that have to make it painful."
"Apple",1,"Don't buy this product. They will put an iphone 3 in an iphone 4 box, and hope that you are too stupid to notice."
"Apple",4,"I like iPhone 4 but at the time was looking for a 4s the iPhone 4g was in great shape..."
"Apple",5,"it was in awesome condition it is working perfectly there is nothing wrong. it is an awesome phone i love it"
"Apple",5,"my iPhone 4 16GB came NEW as they said and as I saw when buying it online works great vary good price to been using it ever since it came in the mail I saw peoples views sayin they got uses phones and all this and that but the iPhone I end up buying from one eye mobile . came new in the box and all I paid $370 for a new Iphone 4 16GB and so will I'm happy with my order"

"Apple",5,"The phone came just as he listed it to be. It is in perfect condition and is a great phone."
"Apple",5,"After reading some of the other reviews I was kind of worried it would not be in great condition, or it would have a big scratch or button that didn't work. That was not the case, the phone came in almost perfect condition, and after taking it to AT&T it was unlocked and I was up and running in no time.I am very pleased with this purchase, and the price was FANTASTIC!"
"Apple",5,"thks, i receive in costa rica, i need to unlock but i do with at&t in states without problems, thank you guys Im using internationally too and works great! love it"
"Apple",5,"some of those refurbish phone have being open to the guts, and some pieces replaced with different kind of chinese brands."
"Apple",5,"I purchased this iphone 4 16 GB as new. Upon receiving it there were issues with it. After contacting Second Cellular by email, I received a call within 10 minutes of the email and talked with Adam who was nothing but curtious and ready to make things right. He not only replaced the phone but upgraded it and sent it to me within 2 days at no extra charge. Wish I could give them 10 stars! Being a caregiver for my mom and in business, when my phone died I needed something fast and Amazon and Second Cellular came to the rescue. This company stands by its products and I will definitly use them again. I turned to Amazon and the top raiting of Second Cellular and gave not only my business but my trust and wasn't disappointed. You can trust you will get the product right with Second Cellular. Thanks Adam for a job well done! Stephanie (Atlanta/Florida)"
"Apple",1,"I purchased 2 Apple iPhone 4 phones from iDeal Expert last month: both looked brand new...but clearly, looks can be deceiving.From the start, one phone had a problem where the recipient heard a strong echo/distortion when speaking which interfered with the conversation. When I sent an email through Amazon clearly articulating the problem to the company, I received a brief response from their team: ""Have you tried calling the manufacture for an exchange?"".Considering my options, I decided to take my phone to an expert to see whether he could solve the problem. A couple of seconds after opening the case, he told me that the phone was not a new one, but refurbished. At a glance, he could see clear evidence of water damage, and it was missing all kinds of screws, fasteners..etc.I was horrified to learn this, and deeply troubled that iDeal Expert considers this acceptable practice - particularly given their supposed ""Complete Customer Satisfaction Guarantee: We stand behind the quality of our products with an iron-clad 100% guarantee. We are in the business of building long-term relationships with our customers, and we are confident that you will be satisfied with each and every purchase made from us. We offer an exclusive EZ NO-HASSLE RETURN POLICY. If for any reason you are not satisfied, simply send your product back to us for an immediate replacement or refund.""In my opinion, iDeal Expert has displayed a flagrant disregard of integrity and have manifest very poor business ethics and practice. I fail to see how such behaviour can lead to ""long-term relationships"", nor to fully-satisfied customers.If my experience is anything to go by, my strong recommendation to all potential purchasers is ""BUYERS BEWARE!"".UPDATE: shortly after my posting, I received an email from the iDeal Expert team as follows: ""This was bought in August, we are now in OCTOBER and cannot accept a return this is past 60 days and we will not accept a return."" I responded to correct their error - reminding them that I had in fact notified their team of the problem well within the time frame, and had even received their acknowledgement of that email.I remain deeply concerned that iDeal Xpert has not only sold defective goods, but then chose to use their 60-time period as an excuse for not dealing with the problem. I still fail to see how such poor business practices are deemed acceptable by the company.UPDATE #2: today, the screen of my iPhone 4 went blank...without any warning, nor any good reason. The phone is again back with my tech expert to try to resolve..."
"Apple",3,"I like my new phone it's just Some things about it i will have to get use to. Like my connection"
"Apple",2,"The phone sounds like I am talking in a tunnel. Nobody can ever hear me on the other line. Not to happy with this purchase."
"Apple",2,"The phone looks great but the home button does not work. I immediately contacted the seller and received no acknowledgement of my e-mail. I was able to adjust the settings on the phone to make it function. I am not satisfied with the seller at all."
"Apple",5,"this is my best bye of the year it is a brand new phone"
"Apple",5,"Came as described! Brand new and great"
"Apple",5,"excelente..."
"Apple",5,"super!!"
"Apple",4,"👌"
"Apple",5,"Arrived in new condition. Excellent!!"
"Apple",1,"IT BROKE TH 3RD DAY - HE POSTED IT AS NEW. IT WAS 4 YEARS OLD"
"Apple",5,"Awesome referbished phone. I would definitely recommend this to someone who's phone has been broken or stolen and is wanting a replacement iPhone. If you are inelidgible for an upgrade and do not have insurance, this is definitely the cheapest route. Great way of purchasing an iPhone at a discounted price."
"Apple",4,"Decent phone, about what I expected for a used phone. The battery life isn't as good as I hoped, and the screen is sometimes unresponsive, but overall it's what you ought to expect if you're not buying new."
"Apple",1,"I'm disappointed because I was told this phone is unlocked but I had a rude awakening when I tried to use it Nigeria. I had to spend more money to get it unlocked. Please when you're selling a product, try to abide by your promises."
"Apple",5,"Love it.shipped on time . Was exactly as described.i have strait talk and this phone dose work with it. You will need to get a SIM card."
"Apple",5,"I am happy with this phone.It does everything I wanted it to do,Very happy with my purchase.Thank you."
"Apple",1,"after couple weeks of using it , i couldnt and still noone can hear me when i give or receive a calltechnically i just use it to txt although i am paying for a service to get both but i can use it as i want"
"Apple",1,"I should have known why this phone was so cheap - it doesn't work. We got it out of the box and it looked fine. Took it to ATT to have the old phone transferred to the new. After all that there was ""no service"". AT&T further inspected to find that the hardware is faulty. Great!"
"Apple",5,"I have been looking for a 32 GB phone that I could use with a pre-paid phone company, that did not cost me $400 to $700. This was phone only worked once I put a SIM Card into the phone. I like how I could use WiFi service to look up things, use the internet for social interaction without using minutes from my pre-paid card or if I did not get the unlimited WEB card."
"Apple",5,"This phone was a refurbished phone, that was unlocked and I could use my home WiFi to look things up and start downloading apps before my SIM card come from the company I was changing too. I bought a 16 GB because I have a Ipod that was 32 GB to keep my music on and other games I play a lot."
"Apple",5,"It's exactly as was described! I love it! It looks brand new! Came super fast and the sender was very easy to communicate with! On top of that, it was actually a 32 GB phone. The price was more than a deal! I would by from them again."
"Apple",2,"Cannot use sim card (overseas)Called ATT and they claimed they cannot unlock it because it isn't activatedAwaiting jailbreak info for IOS 7.1Had to order a different phone"
"Apple",5,"i like the device very much it works very well i use it everyday at work and all the time at home"
"Apple",5,"The phone was in excellent condition just as stated..works wonderful..I'd recommend the iPhone 4 to anyway, it's great, love all I can do"
"Apple",5,"I LOVE MY IPHONE IT WORKS GREATE AND I'M GETTING A NOTHER ONE IN 30 DAYS, FOR MY FRIEND KIM"
"Apple",1,"Not a new phone. We ordered a new phone. We received a used phone. Per Apple the phone was previously registered."
"Apple",5,"i love the phone it is grate thank u so much i am happy that i got it an it was on time i do recommend it"
"Apple",3,"Sometimes Says No Sim When The Sim Is In The Slot & Is Inserted In The Phone . Phone Also Works Slow But Other Then That In Good Condition"
"Apple",1,"Sold the wrong color phone and was not an att phone like ordered. Had it two months and cant use it or unlock it. Very unhappy."
"Apple",5,"This was in great shape and just as it was described. Started right up, able to use the new operating system too! Got one for both kids!"
"Apple",3,"The phone is in really good cosmetic shape and the shipping was speedy, but what was not described was that the home button either does not function, or lags in response. We have had to download an icon app so that we can get to the home screen."
"Apple",2,"The Button at the bottom has to be pressed very hard to get the phone to work. I called the company and they said I would have to send the phone back. I did not have a back up phone so they said the only other thing they could do is refund me $35 out of the $289.00. I took it because I thought maybe it would pay to get it fixed but when I asked how much it would be to get it fixed they said starting at $64."
"Apple",5,"To all prospective Iphone lookers,When i was looking for an Iphone 4 for my friend as a gift, i almost ended up paying about 350$+ for new one. At last i thought about giving this one a try and i must say, its worth every penny.First of, it looks 95% new, let me emphasize on that number. Battery is great, Screen is spot/scratch less, i found maybe a hairline scratch on the side less than few mm long, almost invisible from few feets away. Being a past ATT user, i was able to unlock it for free in about 7 days.On the whole, it was one of best Refurbished/Used i have ever bought for anyone. Never been much of Used electronics enthusiast but this purchase might change my view for future.( Lets hope not ) :)Cheers!"
"Apple",5,"The iphone is in great conditions as it was told on the details, thank you very happy with my order =]"
"Apple",5,"I really like the phone, Thanks It came nicely with bubble wrap so it would not bounce around, again Thanks"
"Apple",2,"I absolutely love the phone, the only problem I have is that when I call someone or receive a call the person on the other end can not hear me."
"Apple",5,"Shipped and arrived on time....Item was just like new and as advertised. Getting the 32GB is worth it if you like having movies on your phone."
"Apple",5,"Works great, received this phone on the date that was published, but as soon as i got it the battery was not fully charged and the charger was not working so i received a new charger. Now the phone is in great condition."
"Apple",5,"excelente buenas condiciones el telefono muy eficiente garantizado o o o o o o o o o o o ok"
"Apple",5,"Great deal, came in time, had it for over a month now, works Perfect just like it should.. I guess I just got lucky this time..:/ but yeah, good sell:)"
"Apple",4,"Phone works great! Delivery was quick, getting it unlocked and switched was a pain, but otherwise! Glad I finally have a Smart phone...."
"Apple",5,"I love the product that was purchased thru amazon. I love the prices the fast delivery and the quality of the phone that I have now. Thank you amazon!! A+"
"Apple",1,"the device shap looked good but i have problem with the home key... it was bad, otherwise it was good"
"Apple",2,"Could have been better charger cord had a short in it FaceTime needs wifi and no finger print scanner and it should have been 4g"
"Apple",5,"Bargain item and works well"
"Apple",5,"Great cellphone. Good seller."
"Apple",1,"Wouldn't even charge when I plugged my charger into the charging port."
"Apple",3,"Good phone"
"Apple",4,"everything as expected. great product"
"Apple",5,"Good product"
"Apple",5,"Great!"
"Apple",1,"Sound doesn't work"
"Apple",5,"excellent"
"Apple",5,"The IPhone 4 does the job I need it to do. I use mine as a phone, GTD apps, and Music-Podcast player. I love the capacity. This is not the latest or greatest, but , for half the price I get 4/5ths of an IPhone 5."
"Apple",2,"The phone I purchased had a problem with the home button. I was able to return it and got all my money back"
"Apple",5,"I bought some of these used-like new iPhone products and it is good enough for me. it is locked by AT&T but not too hard to factory unlocked. highly recommend!"
"Apple",5,"Just what I thought. It's kinda old but looks brand new. Got it for a pretty good price. I will be back"
"Apple",4,"it was a good buy. It was not unlocked so I had to pay for a factory unlock, but it was a good buy"
"Apple",5,"If you're in the market for an iPhone, you probably have made up your mind, and this is as good as they always are."
"Apple",3,"I did not rate that high because the quality wasn't as good. I bought 2 iphones as an anniversary present for myself and my fiance. His phone- home button doesn't work sometimes and the camera phone has a crack in it so the pictures come out fuzzy. My phone- It worked GREAT at first, but one day I barely dropped it and it broke internally. No one has ever seen an iPhone break like that. I ended up having to buy a new phone. If you don't mind spending money and taking a risk with your money then it's a great buy, or if you're not expecting a good quality phone."
"Apple",1,"This cell phone outside is very hurt, a lot of dust, too bad, all the accessories are not original, I want like to return, but I'm in China. I think I will not be here to buy second-hand goods.Feeling too bad! ! !"
"Apple",5,"Sorry for the delay to feedback you....I was traveling...I really really like the product...It`s exactly how it was described....Thank you so much...."
"Apple",1,"It was good product but the accessories are not of good quality.The charger and headphones are not of good quality.Proven the charger and headphones are fake."
"Apple",5,"I love this phone. It came brand new in the wrapped box with all parts included. It was considerably less expensive than many other competitors on Amazon which I worried meant it was too good to be true. Some others were selling this phone with the same specifications for much more.. I gave it as a gift because I had already bought one for myself. The price was so low compared to others for a 4s 32GB iphone w/at&t access. The price scared me a little but it was amazon guaranteed so I took a chance and purchased it and it was perfect.. the person I gave it to as a gift won't stop thanking me for it. Don't be afraid of a good price is the lesson to be learned I guess..."
"Apple",5,"Bought this as a replacement to my broken 8GB iPhone. If you already own an iPhone then you know how useful and widely owned these are. if you don't have one, Apple products, while seemingly fragile, do work extremely well for a long time in terms of performance and durability. I never knew someone who had a physically defective apple anything after any given amount of time. These things do not fall apart ever."
"Apple",5,"its everything that was described to be, I love it! AAA+++++ thank you!!!! this is a honest and fair dealer, just as described!"
"Apple",3,"The phone is reliable it works a lilttle slow and the home button has to be pressed hard but after that it is a good product"
"Apple",4,"This iPhone 4 works great. It came in a box that appeared to be new. The iPhone 4 is not the newest but in my case it gets the job done."
"Apple",1,"The iPhone 4 was sold as like new condition, the bottom right corner glass was shattered and the button intermittently works. It cost me $136 to have it repaired"
"Apple",5,"Great phone! I would recommend it. It may not be the newest version of the iPhone but they are all the same thing in my view. I replaced my blackberry torch with this one."
"Apple",5,"I am very pleased with this item. The phone arrived within a short period of time. It was in a great shape and the seller even included a nice case and a charger."
"Apple",3,"The phone comes in a box like a brand new iPhone. I thought everything was fine with it but It drops a lot of calls and it freezes every once in awhile."
"Apple",5,"Buy this cellphone as a gift for my wife, I like it because it is small and easy to use for her. The system uses the cellphone iphone is very stable."
"Apple",5,"Brand-new, as advertised (not a reconditioned). Packaging was a little sloppy (taping failure), but all made it to me in good condition."
"Apple",4,"Great and new."
"Apple",3,"Good phone, has trouble with home and lock buttons occasionally."
"Apple",4,"Phone is a piece of work. Constantly goes out when talking on phone. I can hear other party but they can't hear me. Not happy ):"
"Apple",1,"it was nice until it broke!! i called only to found out many people have called for the exact same phone for the exact same problem"
"Apple",5,"the phone was in better shape than I could see in the picture I am very pleased with it."
"Apple",2,"First of all wasn't even AT&T, freezes and glitches a lot, doesn't even run on IOS 8, I mean it does it's job but not satisfied"
"Apple",5,"Works as it should!"
"Apple",5,"👍"
"Apple",5,"Very good!"
"Apple",1,"not a great phone this is only phone without any acessoires , lock button not working , send me my paymant"
"Apple",5,"cool"

"Apple",5,"yes it did everything works fine"
"Apple",5,"Excellent iphone!"
"Apple",5,"The quality of the iPhone I received was almost like new plus it came with its own otter box. It shipped out quickly as well. So I'm very satisfied!!!"
"Apple",5,"The condition is just as listed to be like new and it works well. It is much better than my old device which was used for 2 years."
"Apple",5,"The iphone was in perfect condition, looked new with all attachments no failure, no scratches, everything was perfect .... many thanks"
"Apple",3,"I did not get headphone with this item and because of other reasons too i returned this phone, and i got back full amount. I am happy that i got my money back."
"Apple",5,"Everything I want and more. Does everything I want a phone to do and I almost never use my laptop because it is also my mobile computer."
"Apple",4,"Bought this as a backup until I got iPhone 5. The phone was in excellent condition, without any scratches. like new."
"Apple",5,"The product is excellent. Works great and makes my life and time spent on the computer and phone a lot easier and shorter."
"Apple",2,"The phone was 8 gigs not 16 and it said good condition it didnt mention the crack on the screen.Phone works good but info was wrongIm happy with the iphone cuz is an iphoneBut if i need to sell it, im going to have to sell itfor $150 less cuz the screen costs $150"
"Apple",5,"I really love my new phone and the funny part is i use it like every sec. lol thank you for the phone"
"Apple",5,"sir , great phone , as exact u told , 100% satisfied , am really happy about this phone , and i can now buy again sometime from you without any fear :)"
"Apple",2,"Purchased it for my 16 year old daughter, she did not like the picture quality (future photographer/picky) and just didn't like it overall. It just wasn't for her. Ended up going with BLU Energy which she is loving."
"Apple",4,"it was a gift"
"Apple",5,"Product was just what I expected and arrived on time."
"Apple",5,"As posted"
"Apple",5,"Even though it's used it still works like I bought it new. Will probably buy used again"
"Apple",5,"It's a great phone but it was to small for my fingers so I had to send it in to Amazon heh."
"Apple",5,"When the phone arrived it was more than I expected. It looked practically brand new! I will be buying my next phone from here"
"Apple",4,"Good phone for the money."
"Apple",1,"Phone did not work correctly screen sticks tryed to call to remedy the problem got nothing but a run around."
"Apple",1,"that was very very bad .phone work only for 5 min"
"Apple",3,"My iphone 4 arrived in excellent cosmetic condition. It was working fine functionally. But as time passed, I realized that the camera is not that good as it is suppose to be. Also, the home button became sticky after 1 month. I had to press it multiple times to get it to work.I have given it a 3 stars because of its features for the price that I got it for - $360."
"Apple",5,"This was a great deal on the phone. It works great and is exactly how it was described. Thank you so much."
"Apple",1,"Next Time you sell something you should have the box Sealed .When i got this product the Box Was Opened and it said New and you saidyou opened it to see if everything was in the box .Inside was a 16.Gb Phone Instead of a 32.Gb Phone .You tried to take me as a Skr."
"Apple",5,"I am not a HUGE Apple guy, but I can't imagine owning another phone! This one was a replacement for the iPhone 4 that I lost while traveling recently. My wife owns one of the Droid phones and she is NOWHERE NEAR AS HAPPY WITH HER PHONE AS I AM WITH MINE! I plan on keeping this phone until I NEED a new one!!!!"
"Apple",5,"That's good. Big to you thanks! I very much liked to be your client, I will surely use your services again."
"Apple",5,"That's good. Big to you thanks! I very much liked to be your client, I will surely use your services again."
"Apple",1,"The seller mentions that the iPhone is like new but it isn't. It have problem on middle button. Now the middle button doesn't work. The back side of the phone seems to me open before. I am really upset with this. I gift it to my friend and its make me a lot of horrible situation.And seller was helping me to unlock the phone that was good but why he didn't inform me the problem of this iPhone? Why he posted it Like new? Really disappointed:("
"Apple",1,"The piece that I received was not a refurbished as they said, it was a used one. I was not at all satisfied with the product and returned it back."
"Apple",2,"the back screen was all cracked but i didnt worry about that because the phone was used but what i am worrying about is how the phone only came with the charging chord and not the oulet part another thing is the chager dosnt even work so now i have wait till tomorrow to get a charger and hope it was the chager and not the phone overall not so good"
"Apple",4,"Bought this item for my father and he loves it and has already figured out how to load games on it...lol"
"Apple",1,"The dealer was fraudulent, claiming that the phone was new in the box. In fact, it was 3 years old, needed a new battery, and had a defective microphone. It cost $150.00 to replace it with a new iPhone 4 from Apple. Apple can tell you the history of the phone by it's serial number. Never buy from this dealer."
"Apple",5,"Son loves it I got it for him as a Christmas gift and he's very happy and the phone is still running strong! Love this thing!"
"Apple",5,"I give it 5 stars because its my first i phone 4 ever so all nice features keep it up apple company :)"
"Apple",5,"Great condition! In apple box with charger cord. There were no scatches too! This is a good option without a new contract as i wait for the i6"
"Apple",5,"I got this phone used. As advertised it had only minor scratches and it is totally functional. Great costumer support, answered within 1 day and really helpful!"
"Apple",1,"It's not working well you can hear but they don't so the phone it's not good that's why ahi give one star"
"Apple",4,"i purchased this iphone from the amazon warehouse and when i opened it, it looked brand new the only thing to complain about is the home button but that is not even a big deal. It also did take very long to ship and UPS is truly the most crappiest delivery company i've ever had to deal with. But other than that i am very happy with this purchase."
"Apple",5,"I wasn't able to afford a galaxy s3 or 4 or iPhone yet. I was so happy to see this deal. The used phone was pretty much new, no scratches working properly. The shipping was fast I just connected with AIO(great plan they have by the way). I am very satisfied. I haven't had no issues with amazon yet anyway. Love love the phone"
"Apple",5,"Our 1st time to order a cell phone on line. We've always gone into our AT&T store directly. This iphone is like new. No trouble getting personal contact info transfered and having the phone activated. Only wish we had ordered 2 phones from the same seller... Now I on the hunt for another great deal for our 2nd iphone 4s. Wish I could find more from A&Z. Thank You"
"Apple",1,"I ordered a new iPhone from ""One Time Cell"" last week and when I received my phone I noticed that it wouldn't get fully charged so I took it to the Apple store. They connected my phone to their system and told me that the phone had been used three years ago. I was obviously shocked because I'd purchased the phone under the assumption that it was new (I paid for a new iPhone). So I called Amazon and they refunded my money immediately and I reordered a new phone. I got the phone today and took it to the Apple store to make sure it was new but they told me that the serial number on this phone had been scratched and someone had been using it in the past. So I called Amazon AGAIN and they refunded my money AGAIN and I'm gonna return the second one tomorrow AGAIN. This was really frustrating and I never recommend this seller to anyone. Stay away from them."
"Apple",4,"Good."
"Apple",3,"Freezes a lot, also you can no longer pay to get att network switched to tmoible are vise versa. Very easy to crack, I ended up getting the iPhone 5 after cracking three 4s's in a year, and I'm much more pleased."
"Apple",5,"i was real impressed its just wat we ordered thanks so much"
"Apple",4,"Nice phone, however it was listed on a page that said 32gb. Must have been mistaken?"
"Apple",5,"Beautiful. Best phone I've ever had. Arrived with maybe two scratches. Is eligible for straight talk from Walmart which is a great deal. Never a loss of service. Excellent buy"
"Apple",2,"I like the phone but when I call somebody and I can hear them but they can not hear me. That sucks cuz I like to talk to people more than texting. Like I can't call work when I'm going to be late. I would have to text someone who going to work that day so they can say that I going to be late."
"Apple",5,"Good shopping"
"Apple",5,"Works great, clean, great condition."
"Apple",5,"5 stars iphone came & looks like new works great"
"Apple",5,"I am very happy with my phone. It actually came 2 days earlier than scheduled. It was in excellent working condition. I read a bunch of reviews before I ordered it. I was worried about buying used electronics. Something I never do. But, I'm glad I did. I saved alot of money and That's always a plus!"
"Apple",1,"The item was listed as ""like new"", but there were some problems. First, the ear speaker's filter is missing. Second, camera's flash does not work. I cannot understand how they call this item as ""like new"". However, I received %40 discount after buying this item because of these problems."
"Apple",4,"Got good deal for 32gb, but home button did not work. Had to pay to change the button. Overall the phone works. Battery last only a day on standby."
"Apple",3,"It was good product but the accessories are not of good quality.the charger is not of good qualityphone has some issue like sound"
"Apple",4,"It is really good condition and looks new. I like it. and I will recommend to my friends. Good one!"
"Apple",5,"Works good  as the product was as it was described. Works great . I do not have ATT but straight talk and its does not make no difference compared to ATT"
"Apple",3,"It worked fine until i took pics with it. The back camera was scratched terribly. I had to pay 30bucks to change that."
"Apple",5,"Phones were great and strongly recommend this customer. I am looking forward to buy these more ,not sure if there are more in the back stock."
"Apple",5,"so good!it's just a new iphone.And the Black Friday price is also amazing.It would be better if iphone 5 could be sold, haha"
"Apple",3,"I ordered this for my boss and this product came very swiftly. Although some buttons aren't very responsive unless you press it down hard, there are no problems with the harddrive and it's how the item was described to be. He's happy with the phone and I would say this product and seller was very reliable."
"Apple",1,"Got this on time it was new worked perfectly fine. I would so recommend this to whoever would like it.(Update) I had the phone less than a year and i had some issues. I did get the phone flashed so it could work under another network. After having it for a few months people would call me and i would pick up i could hear them, but they were not able to hear me. So I took it to and iphone repair shop over three times, the replaced the microphone and it still didn't work. I gave up and switch to another phone. Money down the drain on this one."
"Apple",5,"Perfect!"
"Apple",5,"I still use it, works great"
"Apple",4,"Phone as arrived better condition than description. Happy :)"
"Apple",3,"thak you"
"Apple",5,"Arrived in condition as advertised. I did not have any problems with upgrade. Works and looks great."
"Apple",5,"We had a question about the iPhone and the dealer got back with us the same day we asked. They explain to us some items about the iPhone and our grandson is very satisfied with his new phone."
"Apple",2,"defective, had to send back"
"Apple",4,"Great purchase! It was as good as new... Screen was immaculate and had no surface scratched. I'm very satisfied with my purchase."
"Apple",3,"It's a great product for a great price. It was in good condition and arrived exactly on the day I expected it to."
"Apple",5,"My iPhone was bought from used powerbookmac.com & it is flawless no scratches or scuffs.i had my phone unlocked from third party vender(60 bucks).because they had no pervious owner info they buy then in bulk.but you can still unlock it through a third party vender. But all in all my iPhone is great the best phone I ever had. It's my first iPhone and for used the shot I took was right on the money. Fast, smooth, clean & crisp like an iPhone is. Buy from the vender if possible. They won't let you down. Item was as describe fast shipping they respond to emails, friendly service, plus only $94 for an used iPhone great deal great experience. A must buy.***** star rating"
"Apple",3,"no comments"
"Apple",4,"So far its being doing fine."
"Apple",5,"I believe I bought this used for my son and it was in great working condition."
"Apple",2,"I received the phone the day before I expected it and the condition was better than expected. But when placing phone calls the person on the other line can not hear you. I constantly breaks up. had to go back to old cell phone and looking to purchase another phone. the two stars are for the shipping time and appearance."
"Apple",5,"Was worried about buying a used phone. I'm very happy with my purchase. Looks and works great! Definitely recommend it!"
"Apple",5,"I love my new iphone, i arrived on time, nw i got all my apps onit. I can reach family and friend near or far"
"Apple",1,"Purchased this product as new. Proximity sensor failed. Apple support told me this phone was purchased in 2011and had no factory warranty. Company will not do any replacement after 30 days, so beware. I have a phone that I cannot use for phone calls. I will not purchase from these people as they state the product is new, but it is not!,"
"Apple",4,"Phone was brand new and worked great.. I also recieved it in 2 business days which was awesome because I paid for standard shipping..my only complaint is the price was a little ridiculous for an iPhone 4 so I'm rating the phone a 4"
"Apple",4,"Great phone"
"Apple",5,"Purchased several as gifts. They arrived on time and were in good condition as the Seller had described. Please note that none of these gift iphones were put on the carrier named. They went on the month to month plans offered at a major chain store that sold a package deal of buy the chip and get a month air time free. Many months later they are all working fine. And the low budget carrier service is even better than my personal 2-year contract carrier.I plan to purchase more of these as gifts soon."
"Apple",5,"very happy with the phone it looks great and works well for me this is my first iphone and I will stay with it"
"Apple",5,"Looks like new, in addition to the HOME key is not sensitive. Good, service is also very good.Hope to continue"
"Apple",1,"I want to return because is not unlockHow can I do it?Please explain to me.Thank you so much."
"Apple",1,"Rated 1 Star because the description said GOOD quality, not an iPhone with a broken home button that doesn't work unless I jam it down. Will have to take to the Apple store for a fix, and could not return it to Amazon because of time constraints. Annoying."
"Apple",5,"This phone came quickly! It said it was ""like new"" and it seemed completely new--had the plastic on the front, etc. It had no scratches, etc. We ordered this phone for my daughter and she was totally excited. This came from the Amazon Warehouse and I would certainly recommend ordering from them. It included the headphones which was great also."
"Apple",4,"I wouldn't have minded buying a phone with a dysfunctional charger, but I would have liked to know what I was purchasing upfront. Luckily, the charger of the phone I'm switching fits this phone - if not, I'd be a very unhappy man with a new phone and no charger. I do want to say everything else was perfect, and I appreciate the price."
"Apple",4,"It came in the mail at a good condition, was a little disappointed the USB cable and the wall plug wasn't included but overall it is good"
"Apple",2,"i bought a new iphone online and the camera has a white shadow on the new phone and every pictures."
"Apple",5,"The unlocked iphone works great internationally. I purchase it for a 2-yr assignment in Brazil and have to say it worked well, never had an issue."
"Apple",4,"I purchased this with the honesty on the sellar that the phone was unlocked and it was not. It cost me additional $40.00 to get it unlocked."
"Apple",3,"One of the speakers on the phone doesnt work ,the sound is low"
"Apple",3,"The home button sticks bad. You have to push a few times hard to have it respond."
"Apple",5,"Great"
"Apple",5,"Great phone my son wanted a iPhone so I decided to go with the 4 until I know he can be responsible with it. Came the day it was suppose to unlocked no problem at all."
"Apple",5,"Thanks it work well"
"Apple",1,"This is my second one, and is really frustrating because i have to take it too have everything copied. I can hear other people on line, but they can not hear me sometimes."
"Apple",5,"I am in love with my new phone no marks looks brand new so far having no problems with it I got it in 1 day and I'm just very excited."
"Apple",1,"Only works with AT&T, no boostmobile no sim card"
"Apple",4,"It's very good"
"Apple",5,"It has all the features needed to make you totally dependent on it. Just try loosing one."
"Apple",4,"I would have kept this phone had it they allowed me to have updates past 7.1. Now Apple has updates for Iphone 4 users. I say get it if you need a cheap go-to smartphone."
"Apple",5,"Thank you, excellent product."
"Apple",5,"Great customer service.....highly recommend for phone purchases"
"Apple",1,"Apple ID was not taken off the phone."
"Apple",1,"Appearance as described, however damaged keyboard unable to log into WiFi or any of my accounts."
"Apple",5,"Everything is as described."
"Apple",5,"very happy with this phone"

"Apple",1,"He meet in a good way am happy about the phone is very good the person that use the phone use it in a good way"
"Apple",2,"Got the iphone a little bit early. They said it would be in perfect condition. Well the iphone came and I had to restore it. After I restored it, I tried to play music and one of the speakers doesn't work. The call volume is also very low. nobody can hear me forreal but I can hear them. it'll sound like my fone is breaking up."
"Apple",1,"Got the phone ahead if schedule, in the condition they described! But when I went to set it up, it came back stolen. I just don't understand how someone can sale stolen products! How do you not know??"
"Apple",3,"Fair over all..product work good no problem thank you I would grade you a plus. Of course I would recomended.."
"Apple",5,"I bought three of those iPhone as a gift. I know in the ads they said it is used.But they are in good quality, no cracks or any bad signs on any of them. The price was a bargain. I liked them so much that I placed another order for two more.Good communication with the seller too.ThanksOmaima"
"Apple",3,"Front screen is perfect, Lots of scratches on the back an home botton does NOT work. Other then that phone works well."

"Apple",4,"I love the phone. It came exactly as described except the home button is sticking. Other than that, great product."
"Apple",5,"excelent"
"Apple",5,"great deal"
"Apple",5,"good"
"Apple",4,"It came on time. It works great.. Thanks"
"Apple",5,"Purchased it to use it as a secondary phone and it worked great. Now I only use it as a backup phone but I am glad I have a phone to go to in case of emergencies."
"Apple",1,"Was defective. The keyboard started messing up. I could hold my finger just over the keyboard but not touch it and keys would press on their own."
"Apple",1,"does not stay charged what a waist of money had to go back to my original phone not what I expected"
"Apple",5,"omg i am so happy i found this phone i had one and the on and off button quit working on me and i was searching amazon and found one just like it and i received it fast thankyou so very much for the fast shipping"
"Apple",1,"Don't work"
"Apple",5,"Good quality and good price"
"Apple",5,"Love it!!!"
"Apple",4,"It worked great!"
"Apple",5,"Use it as an ipod and a backup phone. For 80$ it is an awesome deal! Ipods cost 150+ and this does everything an ipod can do and then some."
"Apple",1,"I tried to use a different sim card, it wouldn't recognize it, I can't use this phone for anything"
"Apple",1,"Received a shotty battery with device."
"Apple",5,"I bought it for my mother-in-law and she loves it."
"Apple",4,"I got this for my son to get him started on the IPhone but without having to break the bank. It will last him a couple of years and then we can upgrade again. The product was brand new, works great and does everything he needs. The seller was prompt. It came right away."
"Apple",5,"Bought for my great grandsons birthday, excellent condition. Also include a case."
"Apple",5,"completely satisfied"
"Apple",5,"I ordered this device on Wednesday and it arrived 2 days later. That was very unexpected. I got everything it said I would except for the headphones. But I'm ok with that because Apples headphones aren't that great. Overall. A great experience. I would definately buy again."
"Apple",3,"The phone was claimed to be new but it was not & it had problems!"
"Apple",3,"Was kinda buggy"
"Apple",3,"good"
"Apple",5,"My sons first smart phone and he loves it! The phone came in excellent condition. For the price and condition it's in, my wife and I consider the phone a steal!"
"Apple",5,"good items, the condition is good, working perfect, i apreciated that the description is real, the software is correct, the hardware is very aceptable, work fine great item dear seller!!! five start for your"
"Apple",4,"The phone works pretty well, but I have had to bypass a button that allows you to change screens because it was sticky and wouldn't always work. I was glad to see that the phone offered this option, must be a common issue with older phones."
"Apple",1,"esuless"
"Apple",5,"Nice"
"Apple",5,"Just as advertised. Am enjoying the shopping experience and phone"
"Apple",5,"what can I say? I previously purchased an I phone from the AT&T. When I found out I had a $200 deductible to replace it, I got this one instead. Great phone. better price. Same phone."
"Apple",5,"This is all I expected ! Works great looks new I got it on time and didnt have to worry about if it was a fake iPhone"
"Apple",5,"bought this for my brother. seems to be completely happy with it. it is an older version, but still serves it's purpose."
"Apple",4,"I ordered a black 32gb iphone 4 but got white instead. Phone didn't look touched and was factory unlocked as needed. The phone is very buggy..im not sure if it's the software that unlocked it or if that's just the iphone's quality. Either way im happy knowing I can use any gsm carrier whenever and have plenty of memory to last till upgrade time."
"Apple",1,"The phone was working fine at first but then we noticed cracks on the back of the phone . Then one morning i checked my phone and it was not turning on the only thing on the screen.was ios6 i took it to an apple store to see if they could fix the problem but they said it was a used item and there was replaced parts in the phone Along with missing screws. When i purchased the phone the statement said the phone was new thats the only reason why i had ordered it ."
"Apple",3,"I ordered this phone, thinking it practically new, but it ended up not even being the phone I wanted. It was the iPhone 4 in White, and it had a crack in it. Also, the battery lifespan was no good. I'm using it because I have no other option, but hopefully someone will call the seller out on it next time."
"Apple",5,"Opyou are the first person i bought a iphone from! I love this when i got it it looked like it was brand new! Even though it had scratchs i cant get over it!"
"Apple",2,"I received my phone on time, but, the phone has noticeable pixels that are moving on the bottom constantly. As if the phone had been broken at some point. Also, there was a circle of dim light cutting off the corners on my screen fully around the screen. Also, I had it brought to tmobile and found out that it was unlocked so that was a plus. THE WORST PART OF ALL WAS... I wasn't allowed to call people, my phone eventually after four months it stopped letting me call people. Another unfortunate error was that I couldn't send pictures to someone who didn't have an iPhone. So overall, you are better off saving your money and looking for a better seller, or goto an actual phone store. You really can't trust people online."
"Apple",1,"I hate suppliers who purposefully do not disclose things or who remain silent when they should announce it. If the Phone is LOCKED, SAY IT. This phone is not unlocked! I don't understand why anyone would pay $400 for a locked phone. Is anybody nuts to do that?This is the problem with Amazon all the time. Faulty and Inadequate advertising, in order to sell products. I would never pay full price for a locked phone because I want to avoid the hassle of going through hoops to get it unlocked. Phone manufacturers and wireless companies ask a million questions to unlock phones. If you can avoid the hassle of unlocking phones, you should because it ain't fun."
"Apple",5,"This Iphone 4 was right out of the box ""new"", not a scratch on it. Works just as if I brought it from Best Buy or At&T. My son loves it ,and the price was a great. No problems what so ever."
"Apple",1,"I received this iPhone 4 and checked it out as soon as i unboxed it, the screen was in perfect condition and the back of the phone was pretty good too only one scratch in the glass, i noticed that the white water damage stickers were removed out of the headphone slot and the charging port. I activated this phone and it worked very well until last night it started to randomly shut down on me and now it will not come on at all or charge!! I received this phone straight from amazon warehouse so i thought it was a safe bet, whats going on amazon??? we have to do better than this! $260 for a lemon."
"Apple",5,"100 % ok"
"Apple",5,"power block for cord quit working 3 days later need to get ahold of them see if it can be replaced"
"Apple",5,"Love it, works great"
"Apple",5,"GREAT!!!!"
"Apple",5,"Loove my phone have no problems hardly no scratches and it's used. Would buy it again when the price is the same again"
"Apple",1,"Didnt work....the seller took it back with no questions...I will buy new next time!"
"Apple",1,"The aid said 16gb, but I got an 8gb? What's up with that.?"
"Apple",4,"I'm OCD and the phone came with a scratch right through the light for the camera. It doesn't affect the picture quality, but amazon said it was a brand new phone! Brand new phones don't have scratches!"
"Apple",5,"it's good to use. I like it."
"Apple",1,"This is the worst phone I have ever purchased or seen in my life. The camera does not work! It freezes and won't let you take a picture. I even brought it in to be fixed and the guy laughed at me and told me to return it as soon as possible. He said he could not fix it and that I should get my money back! Heads up.. Don't buy this phone!"
"Apple",5,"Perfect"
"Apple",5,"Perfect"
"Apple",3,"The mic of the earphone is not work. Just got it two days and the price is cheaper now. I like iPhone 4. Beautiful. Bit my SIM card is big one. How can I make it smaller"
"Apple",5,"i bought it for a xmas gift. I think he would have cried if no one was in the room. he was that happy. and loves it still"
"Apple",5,"Great job!"
"Apple",5,"Absolutely perfect condition"
"Apple",4,"Delivered quick and phone had no issues besides the flash does not work, that wasnt stated in the post."
"Apple",5,"First iphone I've ever had. Great price, great customer service! Came super fast and I love it!"
"Apple",5,"excellent product"
"Apple",5,"It was exactly what they said it would be . Thank you!!"
"Apple",5,"I bought my phone used as to avoid the 2 year contract and high prices of the major companies. We put the phone on Straight Talk and we are loving it."
"Apple",4,"I bought this used item though it doesn't look like used. Except that it has a minor scratch on the back which is unnoticeable. Device is working good but the charging cable looks like not the original one because it broke at the joint exposing the inner wire otherwise great product as expected."
"Apple",3,"Its an Iphone 4 and it was in very good condition, well packaged and delivered on time but I ordered an unlocked phone and the one I got was not unlocked. It cost me $100.00 more before I could actually use the phone."
"Apple",1,"The phone is great but I can not activate because there is a balance on the account it is linked too. Very frustrating."
"Apple",5,"i bought this i phone 4s for a very good price 204 $ itis locked but that is ok beause i paid 30 dollar to unlocked it and itworked great it is in a very good condition with no problem however it does not have any apps or programs i had to downloud every things but it still good for the price i have been using it for over a month and no problem yet i am super happy i defientely recommand it."
"Apple",4,"Amazon warehouse iPhone 4 for my wife cost less than my iPhone 4 purchased through Craigslist.The Amazon iPhone 4 was in better condition and a better $value than what I had purchased through Craigslist.Although the Craigslist iPhone OS software was already upgraded to 6.01, a major software upgrade requiringa complete re-install of all software APPS, iCloud, and Facetime.Amazon iPhone came with OS 4.2 operating system requiring that I perform the complete software upgrade, APPS,and settings reinstall myself, thus the 4 Star rating.If Amazon perform the OS software upgrades, I would have given them a 5 Star rating."
"Apple",3,"The charger is broken. I can only charge my phone through USB, which needs almost 8 hours to get battery full."
"Apple",5,"This product worked great for my birthday gift for my teenage son! High quality and arrived right on time! I really saved a lot of money in comparison to getting this same item at the store.Recommend it to anyone that is looking for savings all the way around on not just time but $$$.Regina"
"Apple",3,"the home key is not work!!the home key is not work!!the home key is not work!!how can i do?"
"Apple",5,"Even though the shipping was delayed it arrived in good condition just as described. Ive only been using it for a couple of days but so far everything is working just fine"
"Apple",5,"Ordered for my son and he has been pleased with the phone. Bought a case for this one. :)Telephone was in good condition with no scratches. Actually better than the description."
"Apple",1,"The phone looked to be in perfect shape. However after 2 weeks of use, phone calls seem to have lots of static then would automatically disconnect.Unable to hear or be heard. Very disappointed. In the process of getting a refund. No exchange was offered."
"Apple",1,"My understanding was that the Iphone I ordered was unlocked for me to use during my international travel, unfortunately It wasn't, as a matter of fact it cost me more, because I purchased a new T-Mobile Sim card, in addition to wasting half of my day trying to get the Iphone to operate. I have to tell you I am not happy with how the Iphone was advertised, it should be clear it was locked."
"Apple",3,"Bought the refurbished iPhone 4 after son's iPhone 3 was stolen while still too early for inexpensive upgrade from AT&T. While I expected minor imperfections (e.g scratches on case), I did not expect that the ear speaker on the phone did not work at all. My son can only use the speakerphone setting or his earbuds while making a call. For the money spent, I expected this part would be working."
"Apple",1,"The product was advertised as ...""IPHONE 4 32GB BLACK.UNLOCKED USING TURBO SIM . UNLOCKED TO USE FOR ANY CARRIER. NEW CONDITION AND COMES WITH ALL ACCESSORIES: WALL CHARGER, USB CABLE, and HEADPHONES.This phone is Brand new, with box, charger and earbuds . The phone is unlocked using Gevey""The phone works fine, but I took it to t-mobile, and they said it was locked. Also, it appears to be the 04.11.08 baseband, which is apparently more difficult to unlock than most.Sent an email, but no response after a couple of days."
"Apple",5,"Phone waa a great purchase, was in great condition no scratches came in an iphone 4 box which was a nice touch."
"Apple",4,"If your an Apple customer you'll love it , just like new , no scratches or appearance of usage .Be sure to have your sim card ready for it ... Comes in box with all accessories needed."
"Apple",1,"Very upset with this product. It says its unlocked using Gevey sim which it is not. The phone i received had too new of a baseband to unlock. Had sratches on back too... Looks like i just bought a $350 paper weight until baseband can be unlocked..... what a SCAM"
"Apple",4,"this product has really good features, its functionality it's awesome, other thing about it that i like it's its graphics its applications."
"Apple",5,"I love this phone. Granted I'm always near a computer or tablet the iphone is great when out and about. It's a user friendly interface and there are a ton of apps. The bluetooth is great too. I use a bluetooth stereo headset at the gym which allows me to play music while keeping my phone safely in the gym bag. Yes apple products a bit expensive but they are darn fun and good. No preinstalled junk apps."
"Apple",5,"I love my phone. It came in the original packaging with all accessories. It was delivered when promised and was in the condition described. It was actually in better shape than I expected."
"Apple",4,"Having a great time using my iPhone! Just made the switch from android to apple and I have no complaints thus far!"
"Apple",5,"I have a positive feedback, I`ve got what I expected, the Iphone is in a good condition and I`m using it with pleasure :)"
"Apple",5,"What't difference between iphone 3gs and 4g?1. 4g has 512 mb RAM while 3gs has 256.2. 4g has new WiFi features , it's n generation while 3gs has older g generation.3. 4g has 1 GHz Cortex-A8 CPU while 3gs has only 600 MHz Cortex-A8.4. 4g has 5 MP camera with flash light and front camera while 3gs has only back camera 3,15 MP .5. Dimensions : 4g has 115.2 x 58.6 x 9.3 mm (4.54 x 2.31 x 0.37 in) while 3g has 115.5 x 62.1 x 12.3 mm (4.55 x 2.44 x 0.48 in) as you see 3gs is thicker and wider .6.

"Apple",4,"I feel very good the whole process even today I have not received one month ago maybe by season, but all good thank god ..... just want to know if the iPhone is released internationally and if you send a code to unlock it."
"Apple",1,"I was showing the Iphone tu my nephew and then went blank and hot and no way to be turned of ... then it dies... I lost my money...I wish to have it back but how?>??/"
"Apple",5,"This product arrived quickly and I love it. akjfa al"
"Apple",5,"Great product, the phone was in great shape and has had no problems so far. No scratches or anything, looked almost new to me."
"Apple",5,"I wasn't sure of purchase, but when I received the iPhone I was glad to seethat the phone was as described. I would recommend this seller."
"Apple",5,"I would have thought it was new if the box was sealed. It was a great but and arrived promptly."
"Apple",1,"I brought this phone on Christmas 2013. It was marked as new. No problems until last week when it attempted to upgrade on its own. It then shut down permanently. Went to IPhone store and through the serial number they determined that it was indeed refurbished and not new. I have contacted the seller and Amazon and have not gotten a response from either. So basically paid almost 300.00 for a nice paper weight."
"Apple",4,"After a few minor issues, we managed to get things worked out., I thought I was buying an unlocked phone, it wasn't, however the seller payed to unlock it and my step-daughter is happy with her birthday present"
"Apple",1,"Could not hear a phone conversation unless i had the ear phones hooked up. Played music ok. Everything else worked fine."
"Apple",5,"My iphone is very nice. I didn't expect that because it is amazing. It works fine. Many people like it."
"Apple",5,"It's an iPhone, so it's easy and all that. I'm more rating the seller - I bought this used from Laptop Angels and it arrived 4 days earlier than expected and as of yet seems fully functional. Took it to ATT and it was unlocked and worked with my provider, as advertised. I've had no problems with it so far."
"Apple",2,"well i got this for around 120$. not bad. really good actually. definetly isnt perfect though. however i see how the repacking at the amazon lab could have missed these details... sim card tray was stuck so i had to google the problem and do surgery on the phone to get my sim card in. involved a screwdriver and a pin. not rocket science but lame. then after turning the phone on ( i noticed the speakers were full of dirt- it had had full a life before me), i noticed the 2nd hangup- the home button does not work. makes navigating difficult. googled that and managed to resensitize it for a few minutes but then lost its responsiveness again. I Ended up using it is assistive mode with a touchscreen floating home button. does the trick, though lets face it its not as it should be, however, the phone was 120$ instead of 500$. So if your ok with a few tech repairs and character building glitches go with the cheaper then average but still operable restocked iphone 4 :)"
"Apple",5,"Very good product as shown in the page for a very good price !! I recommend, and hope you enjoy like me !"
"Apple",1,"The volume did not work at all, no one could hear me on a call and I could not hear from my end of the call. I was very disappointed because this was the second iphone I had to send back and a big waste of my time ..."
"Apple",1,"The back glass was broken but was covered up with a case and if I did not have my old Iphone to trade parts with it would had been bad."
"Apple",5,"It was very nice and it looks like it came with a brand new charger and headphones! Awesome and Thank you!"
"Apple",4,"Great condition as promised. I purchased it for my teen. Happy with purchase and function with the exception that the home button sticks sometimes."
"Apple",1,"I have years buying into this company, but I am very disappointed in this case, I wanted 2 iphone 4 released and sent me two ihpone 4 not work because it was not what I was offered. me and nobody can solve this problem. I'm just very disappointed and I do not expect this from a company like amazon. I have many friend who I had spoken ill of you, but no one learns from experience of others. could not recommend them more hurt and having to use another company for future purchases."
"Apple",5,"i love it"
"Apple",1,"The worst Apple iPhone I ever had."
"Apple",5,"Not a scratch on the product ,and shipped very quickly!"
"Apple",5,"Would recommend them to anyone. I washed them and they came out beautifully when I took them out of the dryer. You can tell they are high quality sheets."
"Apple",5,"it works I am very happy!"
"Apple",1,"no"
"Apple",5,"As discrived, on time, I contacted them, they crarified my concerns, and the phone works as I expected so far, Service was really good, the person was really great."
"Apple",1,"They say is new but is use ítem"
"Apple",5,"Bought from Amazon Warehouse Deals. Phone came quickly, and I was surprised at the great condition it was in when I received it. The ""cosmetic damage"" was negligible to the point that it looked like a new phone, even though the condition was rated as ""good"". After a few hours of operation I noticed a significant problem with the home button and am sending it back. Going to try my luck with a different AWD iphone."
"Apple",3,"Send it to my girlfriend to the Philippines and spent more to have it activated I thought it was unlocked I should have just bought it over there"
"Apple",1,"SHIPPED A 16 GB WITH A FAKE PAPER PRINTED 32 GB LABLE WITH A BARCODE AND A IMEI NUMBER, TOOK IT TO APPLE AND CONFIRMED IT WAS A 16 GB, AND ATT CONFIRMED THE BARCODE WAS NOT THERES AS THEY DO NOT BARCODE THEIR PHONES THEY USE APPLES ORIGONAL, DO NOT BUY!!!"
"Apple",4,"So far I enjoy this device does everything I needed it to do. I would definitely keep shopping with amazon"
"Apple",5,"Product was in excellent condition. I ordered this to replace the not very user friendly android phone I had been using. I will never have anything but an iPhone from here on out."
"Apple",2,"Fast shipping the item scratch a lot honme button not working wel a camera is not clear need change len"
"Apple",4,"The phone is in great condition and didnt show much signs of wear and was exactly what i was looking for"
"Apple",4,"It is very nice, only issue is it cannot be unlocked due to it is non-full price of purchase. I was told before, if I bought at&t, i can use t-mobile prepaid card. but because of the price, i cannot. Otherwise, this is very helpful cell phone. can you tell me how to recharge the money for each month? which phone number to call for at&t prepaid card? thanks"
"Apple",5,"Wife love her phone"
"Apple",5,"I could not afford a new iPhone 5 so I opted for a used iPhone 4 and it has been excellent so far. The main reason I got it is because of the apps I can use while traveling, birdwatching etc. I used to fumble when answering my phone, but now it is a lot easier...with just a slide action I answer it. The ring on off button is easy to use. Going to 2 different emails is easy. I am learning to deposit checks in my bank account. No more lost checks!"
"Apple",2,"Not very good reception to phone and doesn't keep charge well. But in great condition exterior wize."
"Apple",2,"The battery Is horrible !! Dies within 20 minutes."
"Apple",5,"Its ok. Awsome. Is great for the price the only thing that was bad was the wall charger cube, it generated no charge just on and off. i had to charge the phone on a old charging dock station. Overall im satisfied. Will submit an update a review soon."
"Apple",3,"A lot of the apps that are out there now will not work with the older OS. The Iphone 4 is limited as to upgrades in OS as well. While I knew I was buying old technology I didn't realize that the apps were no longer available."
"Apple",4,"Great phone for the price."
"Apple",5,"Loved this phone. Mistake to do away with it"
"Apple",5,"great I just ordered the wrong one"
"Apple",5,"This was the first time I purchased a refurbished iPhone. It came in the original box and the cords looked brand new. The phone was in great shape and looked new also. I have not had any problems with this phone so far. I love iPhones and I like that this phone has 32 gb because I take a lot of pictures. I have not run out of room yet. I was really apprehensive about purchasing a refurbished phone but I'm glad I did. It saved me a lot of money buying it this way rather than a brand new phone. I wouldn't be able to tell the difference. It sounds great and runs perfectly like it is suppose to. I would defiantly purchase another refurbished phone again in the future."
"Apple",5,"Got this for my sister in law and she loves it!"
"Apple",1,"I bought this in February and im just now getting it the phone is cracked and it's white I ordered black be careful people"
"Apple",5,"I got this phone for my grandaughter for Christmas. She loves it!"
"Apple",5,"thanks"
"Apple",5,"perfect"
"Apple",1,"this phone was sold as new worked for 3 mnths then stopped took it to the nearest apple store which was 3 hrs away for them to tell me it was a ""frankinstien"" meaning there were some apple parts an some that were not now NOBODY will help 300$ just gone"
"Apple",2,"It's not bad for the price, but there is lots of glitches in it! Another thing, it says it comes with a charger and it didn't! The only thing good about it is that it came quick!!"
"Apple",5,"Good"
"Apple",4,"Iphone came in very good condition as described, but the charger was not working well. I had to get a new one. Besides that, everything was ok."
"Apple",5,"A++"
"Apple",3,"Overall the phone works fine, but some of the buttons stick or don't work at times"
"Apple",2,"did not function well - very disappointed in the product. not as described."
"Apple",5,"It was a pretty good item and not bad price it was a little scratched up but i can fix that easyly so"
"Apple",1,"It didn't work. The microphone wouldn't work half the time and the person couldn't hear me. Photos were unclear with lines across the screen!"
"Apple",1,"The phone does NOT work right, and never has. Sure, you can call out on it, and you can receive calls BUT ....no one can HEAR YOUR VOICE ... unless you switch the 'speaker phone' on! That part is not working right, and it has not since the day we received it. This was a gift for someone without a phone at all, and now she has one that only works halfway! NOT RIGHT! I've written the Seller already and now have submitted a claim via Amazon too. So far, the Seller is NOT returning emails or calls. Maybe Amazon itself will have better luck -- and if not, perhaps this store does not need to be an Amazon store at all.Let's see if they answer this, the THIRD request for replacement! A full replacement or even a full return of funds in the next 24 hours would certainly be welcome since we thought we bought a WORKING CELL phone. This one does not work right, period. we demand a replacement that works or a full refund within the next ten(10) days."
"Apple",5,"This is my first apple product ever. I had been wanting one for years but this was in my price range. A lot of my friends have the 5 or 5s and all suggested I start with the 4 since they feel the ios system is better on it. The phone I got was used, but looks near to new. Only a few extremely light scratches that you can't even see when looking directly at it."
"Apple",4,"For the price i paid the phone was in excellent condition! No scratches at all!!! All buttons worked great. Got phone activated yesterday with no issues. The only thing i didn't like was the amazon sticker was on the back of the phone and is VERY HARD TO GET OFF. Perhaps vacuum sealing the phone and putting the label on the plastic would be much better in the future. I cant scrape the sticker off due to the back being made of glass!"
"Apple",4,"It was fast and the shipping was minutes after I made the delicious to buy the phone, I was needing any phone cause I lost mine phone"
"Apple",1,"I need you to do the reverse in a gift card not refund my card because those dollars are the only ones I had and made me lose that money because in my country we do not handle that currency and it becomes very difficult to acquire and I think a irresponsibility on your part shall carry out, then q let her buy it so long to inform you could not sell the product then q I would like my money come back in a gift car so we can make a new purchase on this page thank you very much and expect an answer as this seems to me a grave lack of respect for my"
"Apple",1,"there were multiple issues with the phone that was supposed to be refurbished. this was the first product I purchased through here that I can say was a waste of money and I order a lot."
"Apple",1,"This is clearly the wrong phone and it would be excellent if whomever repackaged this actually looked at the box which clearly states VERIZON not what it was sold as AT&T. The irony here is these 2 different networks also use different carries AT&T is GSM and Verizon is CDMA. So this phone is a complete fail there too."
"Apple",4,"Only one speaker works and it's not unlocked... Other than that it works pretty good but just those problems. Yeah."
"Apple",4,"good product"
"Apple",2,"Good"
"Apple",4,"Good"
"Apple",5,"bought this 4 for my husband since he liked mine so much and really couldn't pass on the deal that I got when opening up a Amazon credit card"
"Apple",5,"Good quality. Fast. No problems."
"Apple",5,"Excelente"
"Apple",1,"Unable to unlock"
"Apple",5,"Bought two for my kids Christmas present. They are going to be so happy. Looks brand new!!"
"Apple",2,"The phone in its self is amazing but the batteries messed up in both it won't stay charged for nothing and then you plug it in and I jumps the percent of the phone up like 10% like its not really dying"
"Apple",1,"Not long after purchasing this product it already is making me regret it. It randomly goes black and doesn't allow me to restart it or turn it back on. After reading the reviews about some users experiencing glitches and malfunctions I should have went with my gut and not purchased this product. Don't make the same mistake I did, you truly do get what you pay for."
"Apple",4,"The fineness also good, no problem on the phone functions.Official unlock also very cheap, about $ 1.Unlock the future is very easy to use."
"Apple",1,"its just stupid to have CDMA & GSM, worst idea Apple ever came up with. this sucks!! definitely going with windows phone now."
"Apple",3,"The only thing bad about the phone was that it had a sticky home button which was not stated when I purchased it. Super disappointing."
"Apple",5,"the phone is perfect. no scratches no cracks, nothing. it looks practically brand mew. thank you for this awesome phone!"
"Apple",1,"I bought this for my girlfriend for Christmas, who had been wanting an iPhone, for the longest time. I found this deal, and I was very excited to get it for her. I've had great experiences with the Amazon Warehouse, I've bought numerous games on here.Anyways, I went with my great experiences and bought the phone. I give the phone to her on Christmas Day. The home button does not work. After the phone is on for a long amount of time, the screen turns yellow.The worst part about it is, I have always bragged on Amazon's Customer Service. They've always done me right. This time, they did not. They basically told me to take it to an Apple Store. I paid $250 for this phone. I paid $250, for a working, functional phone, that was almost ""Like New"". Amazon has lost a lot of credibility among the online community, with lackluster service and promotions. They've definitely lost another customer with me. All I want is the phone replaced with a working phone, that my girlfriend can use. Is that too much to ask? A simple replacement?To anyone reading this, if you are looking to buy a phone, do not do it from these people. Save your money, and just buy it off Craigslist. I would love for somebody from Amazon to contact me and make good on this deal. I have always respected and bragged about this company. I will never, ever pay for Amazon Prime with the treatment I have received regarding this transaction.So Amazon, thank you for ruining my girlfriend's Christmas."
"Apple",5,"It was really like new!!! I baught it for my Brother-in-law, he is very happy with the phone. Very Good Deal."
"Apple",5,"Needed a replacement phone for my daughter This one made her very happy! Was received in as advertised condition. Fully functional. No noticeable scratches on screen, original plastic on back, and otterbox works great."
"Apple",5,"I wrote a previous review about this phone. It was not a 32GB as listed, but a 16GB. It was not unlocked either. After contacting Amazon, they did all that was necessary to correct the problem along with a full upfront refund before receiving the phone back. Thank you to Amazon for their hard work in the customer service department."
"Apple",1,"it can hardly be used,even it's Appearance looks good.but I'm in china now,I can't return it.i do not know who can help me."
"Apple",5,"Phone meet my expectations! I was scared @ first, but it was in excellent conditions and worth the money! <3"
"Apple",1,"Battery lasted 6 months... do not recommend. This phone has a problem with the screen touch. Many times, it will not recognize I'm pressing a button on the screen. However, it will constantly think my ear is a button. It's VERY annoying!. I don't recommend buying this phone from this company."
"Apple",5,"thanks for all, i like it"
"Apple",5,"Thanks!!!"
"Apple",3,"came as advertised."
"Apple",2,"Second phone I have purchased from Amazon..., This one worked two weeks before freezing up. I read all the reviews and chose to try again but was disappointed for a second time. Our phones make or break our business so not having usage for an hour can impact our lives. Amazon has always faired well with every other purchase we have made."
"Apple",5,"Phone came as expected, works great"
"Apple",4,"Its a good, working phone with minkmal cosmetic damage. One of the speakers does not work at all though."
"Apple",5,"Better than I expected upswapit is better company than chelseewood"
"Apple",4,"There was one major scratch on the front but all the buttons worked and shipping was faster than expected"
"Apple",1,"it was used and it glitches"
"Apple",3,"Amazon hopes the sale of second-hand mobile phones to establish standards to limit certain unscrupulous businessmen shoddy second-hand mobile phones. I hope bad business to strictly enforce the Amazon proprietary standard used phones."
"Apple",1,"I placed an order for Iphone 4 AT&T lock and was delivered an IPHONE 4S Verizon Lock. I have travelled abroad therefore I can't return the IPHONE 4S Verizon Lock and latter I check for ESN and found that it had a BAD ESN. I am totally disappointed by this purchase. I am not able to replace this phone."
"Apple",1,"LOVED the phone, until I realized that the home button did not work. Could not make it go ""home"" no matter what I did. Was easy to return and get money back, But will NOT buy from this seller again. Phone was suppose to be in very good condition, would HATE it see what condition a phone in ""good"" condition would be like."
"Apple",1,"The iPhone 4 32 GB (Black) - AT&T was presented as ""Brand New"" and turned out to be NOT. An Apple store technician told me that it is a ""Frankenstein."" /ss"
"Apple",5,"For some reason, I returned the product after using it for a month, the product is good though.The full refunded me!"
"Apple",5,"This was exactly what I wanted and needed.It has worked nicely for me and couldn't help the great price of it."
"Apple",1,"the signal is super weak, the phone is out of signal most the time.The battery is ran out so quick and also the phone gets boiling hot just after 20 mins on calling.Often, the shop pauses by itself and you cannot return the home page.Definitely wasting my money on this phone !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
"Apple",5,"The phone was brand new in box new charger new and everything worked and still functioning well as we speak I'm on it now"
"Apple",3,"all very well and fast, and all this and that is described in the publication recommended for future purchases recommended 100%"
"Apple",5,"We haven't had much success with used apple products, but I decided to give it one more go. This phone is exactly as the seller described. It works beautifully. Most importantly, I have a very happy 15 year old whose iPhone 3 was seriously on it's last leg. Her favorite feature is facetime. :)"
"Apple",5,"awesome phone awesome seller!!!"
"Apple",4,"Phone did freeze and went completely black for hours but was still on contaced apple support to figure out why and they told me how to fix the issue hopefully it doesnt happen again the phone itself is in very good condition besides this incident"
"Apple",3,"I was excited to have gotten this phone in spring of 2013. I upgraded from an iPhone 3GS (yes I know I am behind on the times here). The phone carried so much memory and data that I was able to keep up with the new data downloads or whatever you call it. I never once had to erase or delete my apps and camera roll (as what I had to to do with my iPhone 3GS).Let's fast forward...I only used the phone for 11 months. Just right after I upgraded it to the new iOS (Spring 2014), my iPhone 4 acted up badly!! I couldn't get out of an app for how many times I hit the ""home"" button. It drove me crazy. And I couldn't even get into my call screen without having to hit home so many more times. I hated my phone because of the iOS that was downloaded at the time.I parted ways with my iphone4 (it was a sad moment) and left AT&T to be with Verizon.Verizon embraced me and got me the iPhone 5s. Yes it was a huge leap from the early iphone 4 to now an IPhone 5s (yea I felt like I was ballin' like a rockstar....until iphone 6 came out and then I ran out of memory on my 16gb iPhone 5s)....yea just because I left my iPhone 4 32gb for an IPhone 5s 16gb; I sure miss all those extra stored memory of my iphone4. It's not always greener on the other side. But damn that iOS upgrade that ruined my iPhone 4, otherwise me and the iPhone 4 would still be together no matter of upgraded phones I could've gotten. :("
"Apple",5,"Great phone! Fast delivery."
"Apple",1,"Phone died within 92 days. Took it to Apple and need to buy a replacement already. Would NOT buy from Warehouse Deals again."
"Apple",1,"the person you call can't hear you!!! had the phone for only a few weeks!!!"
"Apple",5,"Just got it thank you."
"Apple",4,"very good"
"Apple",1,"If I could rate lower than this I would. 4- 5 months later the phone started messing up. And now 8 months later it barely functions. I tried to contact the seller, without much help. After recommending I change the charger or restart it they have just stopped communicating. I give them an AWFUL review!! My phone was kept in an otterbox without any damage, whatsoever. And it has still managed to stop working. No sound anymore, therefore no alarm, no videos, no ringtone or text tone. The phone just shuts off for no reason at all. And does not come back on for several minutes or longer sometimes. I could go on and on about the problems."
"Apple",3,"I bought this phone 2 years ago and it worked perfectly fine but after a couple months of use the home button stopped working and eventually the lock button on top began to stick, I just sold this phone to buy a Samsung Galaxy Note 2 which is way better than this phone."
"Apple",5,"Excellent phone!"
"Apple",2,"Advertised as like new but not even close. The screen was filthy it looked like a toddler was playing with it while eating."
"Apple",5,"Arrived and worked just as expected."
"Apple",5,"good"
"Apple",5,"great product and great customer service!"
"Apple",5,"I love it thankx"
"Apple",4,"Phone is OK. Only problem is home button malfunction. I have to press extra hard for it to work."
"Apple",5,"Very good thank you"
"Apple",5,"I love it! so light"
"Apple",1,"I bought this phone and after a months of using it,it died on me i took it to the Apple store to have it fix and they told that my phone was faked...meaning amazon sell fake stuff for high prices."
"Apple",5,"Thank you the phone looks like it is brand new and works great! Couldnt be more happy with the product. highly recommended!"
"Apple",4,"I've had this iphone for over a month and its easy to use and fun. The earpiece did stop working for awhile but it seems to be working now."
"Apple",5,"After Verizon changed its upgrade cycle that coincided with both of my phone upgrades, I was left to either replace my son's non-functioning phone by purchasing an iPhone 5 for over $600, wait for next year to upgrade/replace or pay $200 to repair my son's originally free phone. I opted to check out what was being offered for last year's iPhone on Amazon and found a reasonably priced slightly used iPhone 4 with a great deal of memory. The device works as expected, no blemishes (at least none that I could find and I think there was mention of typical minor wear and tear - I saw none but I think that has to be put out there for used/refurb devices) and all cords, chargers were included in packaging. It was delivered early and my son is thoroughly pleased to go from a free Samsung smartphone to an iPhone 4 (granted he wanted the 5 but he's 15 - he'll live...besides he's happy to be at the same level his friends are at with their phones). I will be purchasing my phone this way and going outside of Verizon's market from now on. This seller is outstanding, the service and quality easily exceeds expectations. Thoroughly pleased!!!!"
"Apple",5,"I wanted an iPhone that was current but inexpensive. I found it on amazon. Good price, good product. I am very pleased."
"Apple",4,"Its an iPhone 4. Nothing too special about it. I got mine fairly fast for where I live (the middle of a cornfield). Ordered a Verizon phone and got a Verizon phone. There were a few small scratches on the back of the phone but I put a case on right away. The only thing wrong is there is a small spot on the screen that is more whited out than the rest of the screen. Not big and not a big issue. Ive been using it for a few months now. I have finally activated the phone and had no issues. Only reason for 4 stars is the whiter spot on the screen. Great seller."
"Apple",2,"I got it earlier than expected with everything. But,it came compleatly scratched up. But it still works. Can hardly see the screen."
"Apple",5,"Great this seller doesn't lie everything was just as he said it would be!Everything works great and the iPhone has changed what I thought of my Droid"
"Apple",5,"I purchased this phone for my husband and he is very satisfied with the performance and the capabilities. One of his favorite gifts ever."
"Apple",4,"Small crack on body of device, not internal problems, software is fine,activated with no problems overall am very happy with my buy thank you so much."
"Apple",2,"Not refurbished very well. It acts up and has trouble at times with certain actions. It did have a new screen, though, so that part seems fine."
"Apple",5,"Very fast shipping-great product- works great:)"
"Apple",5,"Excellent value, product as stated"
"Apple",5,"Product as described, good value"
"Apple",5,"thank you. great experience!"
"Apple",3,"I like the phone itself though when I first got it I had to do a software update. Also my charger base is already not working and needing to be replaced. It doesn't keep a charge for as long as I would like. It seems to take forever to charge via computer or in my vehicle."
"Apple",1,"I took the phone to Verizon store to transfer the info from my old phone to this new one. They couldn't because they said the phone wouldn't respond. Needless to say I had to return the phone and wait 4 weeks for my refund."
"Apple",1,"Quit working after a week. Just shuts off. Will turn on for about 5 mins after reset or hooked to a charger. Replaced battery. Still no go."
"Apple",4,"the home button was kinda not working you have to hold for a long time to access home"
"Apple",5,"Excellent."
"Apple",1,"The phone I bought was new but was so slow, the screen was dark even on the highest setting, and random things would pop up for sign in. Apps ran super slow, especially maps, and siri didn't even work.Worst phone I ever bought I returned. LISTEN TO ME don't buy this phone. You will regret."
"Apple",1,"I've barely owned this two months and it already fails me. The sound/speakers work fine with everything EXCEPT when it comes to notifying me of incoming calls/texts/etc. Oh sure, the alarm works when I need to get up in the morning for work, and for playing podcasts, videos, and music. But what's the point of a phone when a call or text comes in and I have NO idea? Horribly inconvenient. I didn't buy this phone for fun, I need it to COMMUNICATE. This is my first Apple device and truly the biggest regret I've ever purchased. If only my financial situation allowed me to make this right - to buy a new/better phone - but, dang. I'm screwed over and there's not much I can do about it. Thanks Apple."
"Apple",5,"Good"
"Apple",3,"It didn't meet my expectation because it had no sim slot available."
"Apple",1,"I hate the iPhone I purchased and am now searching to replace it. I will never buy another iPhone."
"Apple",1,"Volume would not work..."
"Apple",4,"The home button doesn't work all the time but it is a used phone and I can work around the home button. Arrived promptly with no problems."
"Apple",5,"Awesome buy! I appreciate the nice communication between seller and I. Phone is in great condition and also came with a case and phone charger! Thank you"
"Apple",1,"I want my money back!! What a disappoint :( never expected this to happen to me "
"Apple",1,"The bluetooth doesn't work since I bought it, bad, bad, bad"
"Apple",1,"So bad"
"Apple",2,"My aunt does not like it. Only the first owner of the phone can unlock it. In addition, it comes with a MEID number instead of IMEID which needs to be verified before using the phone. My aunt informs me that she is thinking of returning the phone."
"Apple",4,"service was great, iPhone is a 4, all I could afford, and slow compared to my 4g. Still, I like the phone."
"Apple",1,"I purchased this phone in June 2014, and now October of 2014, not even 5 months later I have to have the button that turns it off and on replaced. Not a happy person!"
"Apple",5,"sold it and bought it back works well"
"Apple",1,"Very disappointed with this phone. The charger base never worked from day one. It has given me constant trouble. It even wiped out all my contacts, pictures, and texts. I will have to bring it to the Apple store to see if they can fix it."
"Apple",1,"NO SIM VERZION"
"Apple",5,"fast shipping. recieved better than described. only negative was phone was left on during shipping"
"Apple",5,"Just as described. Fast delivery"
"Apple",1,"The phone didn't work..the sensor was broken so every time I tried to make a call it would continually dial. The battery was Also broken, the phone wouldn't keep a charge"
"Apple",5,"Great! Fast shipping! Good product!"
"Apple",5,"Great value for the price. iPhone was clean and was received promptly."
"Apple",5,"I was able to load all of my music onto this phone."
"Apple",5,"VERY happy with my purchase!!! It was a Christmas gift for my husband and he adores it. Uses it every minute of the day! Thanks for a great product and super speedy delivery!"
"Apple",1,"Very disappointed with purchase I'm having problems sending mail with the iPhone and now my iPad as well. The aol.com email doesn't send my email but I'm receiving my email to my email account! When I try to send a message it says that the password or the username is incorrect! Please help? Thank you!"
"Apple",4,"I like it, the big memory is good for the music I like!"
"Apple",1,"Worked for 7 days and then wouldn't charge or even come back on."
"Apple",5,"Great price, 69.99. arrived quickly and works perfectly. Appears to be brand new."
"Apple",5,"Awesome produce, awesome price. Thank you so much"
"Apple",5,"My kids love these phones! They have used them for over 6 months without any problems."
"Apple",1,"This phone has no SIMM slot - pretty much worthless if you want to use with any carrier."
"Apple",1,"I tried to turn it on and it had been rerouted. Ended up having to pay 50 dollars more and Verizon for another phone that had only 8gb so needless to say IM VERY PISSED AND DISAPPOINTED"
"Apple",5,"ok got the phone in 3 day after ordering. i went with the shipping set up amazon pre assigned. did not pay anything extra. brand new in box sealed. it is just as advertised. t has an update available to iOS 7 upon set up if you go to settings then general and tell it look for update. it comes with iOS 6 . yes FaceTime is available. i would recommend alpha cell via amazon. i am a happy camper. have not set up with verizon yet wanted make sure it worked first. worst case its an iPod.http://www.verizonwireless.com/support/how-to-activate-apple-iphone-4/including activation set up from Verizon. not easy to find. must do this before attempting to make Verizon account. make sure everything you do is on the prepaid account side. last note here the 30 day prepaid account is unlimited talk text and web. the 30 dollar card gets you the whole month. I paid with 2 15 dollar cards to make the 30."
"Apple",1,"Horrible don't buy. Glitches"
"Apple",5,"The phone looks great and exceeds expectations. It has a heft that makes me realize it's a phone and no longer am iPod!"
"Apple",5,"Great"
"Apple",5,"Still working until now, excellent"
"Apple",5,"Excellant"
"Apple",2,"The phone I bought would only hold a charge for 6 hours, very disappointed."
"Apple",1,"No one can hear you talk on it. Can only talk with the speaker phone or via Wifi with another device.Totally bummed. Returning it as soon as I find another phone!Thought the ""deal"" was too good. And it came wrapped in a Iphone 4 box and all, and it sure looked New!Too bad it does not work. I can't walk around using the speaker phone, and I am not using an ear piece.Perfect if you dont actually want to talk on it!"
"Apple",5,"Amazing"
"Apple",5,"The phone is in perfect condition, it looked pretty much brand new! No scratches, no dents, no blemishes at all.The phone operates flawlessly. I am so happy with my purchase. Thank you so so much."
"Apple",5,"EXCELLANT AND IN SERVICE NOW"
"Apple",5,"Works like a dream.... very very nice"
"Apple",4,"It's an iPhone- there's not too much more to say. It works great with all our other Apple products and the price was excellent for the large memory. I've been happy with it so far."
"Apple",5,"This phone is AMAZING It works so well"
"Apple",1,"It freezes up 2 much and stop working"
"Apple",5,"Great iphone, excellent price."
"Apple",5,"Everything is great. Phone works good no scratches or anything. All the buttons work ... Doesn't move slow (yet). But honestly I will buy phones like this from now on. 80 bucks you can't beat that."
"Apple",5,"Phone did not work right and the seller took care of problem fast happy with result"
"Apple",3,"I cannot used, because I'm from Venezuela, and here cannot use CDMA. But is a good phone if you are in USA"
"Apple",4,"The battery hasn't got much life"
"Apple",1,"I ordered two of these phones. On both of them the home buttons do not work correctly, you have to push them multiple times to get them to work, and sometimes you can't get them to work at all. These were a complete waste of money. I would definitely stay away from these!"
"Apple",5,"Very nice phone. My wife loves it."
"Apple",4,"It has been a great phone. Can't complain at all. I felt it was a good price also. Came with all the newer updates."
"Apple",5,"Great phone sold it and upgraded to the 5s. Excellent product as described."
"Apple",5,"Great sale... No problem was sent and delivered as promised..."
"Apple",1,"Made in China. Glitchy. Updated Sept 2016: phone wouldn't hold a charge then refused to turn on altogether. Glass is not iPhone glass. I have owned a couple.iphones and this one didn't seem like a legit one. It wasn't worth the $ at all."
"Apple",5,"Works perfect!"
"Apple",1,"I am very upset about these cell phones. They are very problematic. I bought the cell phones because my husbands phone was broken and he needed a new one. I was told in the add these were NEW phones, so I bought one for myself also because it had 32GB and I have a 8GB. Since I have had my old phone I had no problems so I'm thinking I'll get another iphone S since old one worked so well. However, my husband has had nothing but problems with the phone since I bought the cell phone for him. We have been to the Apple store three times. My husband has had music coming out of the phone for no reason. He did not have any music on at the time. The cell phone freezing up and not responding to touch. The other one I bought for myself will not allow me to type Text messages with certain letters (like the T and g do not work). I cannot open the phone I have to swipe it many many times before it will open if at all. I'm so frustrated with this phone."
"Apple",1,"The phone I bought completely went black and does not work at all. I took it to Apple and they said it was non repairable! I havent had the phone a full 30 days!"
"Apple",5,"💜"
"Apple",5,"The product was as stated. Very pleased."
"Apple",3,"The phone works, was packaged as new but the charger did not work."
"Apple",5,"Veery good phone love it"
"Apple",5,"LOVE my phone. It has been working great. Very impressed."
"Apple",1,"I was unable to activate the phone with my provider. They told me that the phone had been reported stolen, and as a result when trying to activate it, Apple locked it down so it cannot be used as anything but a paper weight."
"Apple",2,"Lasted only 1year. Crapped out! Does not work after 1year. Oh well."
"Apple",5,"i love my cracked iphone 4!!!"
"Apple",2,"The phone we bought melted within 1 month of purchase (used)due to the battery."
"Apple",3,"not bad but it is old some games will freeze and I didn't get earbuds"
"Apple",5,"my brother tell me to buy a Iphone i don't to buy it because i don't how to used it. My first time to buy a Iphone and i love to used it, it's awesome. if i have more money i buy the black one too."
"Apple",4,"Pretty decent phone, had more scratches than expected but hey it works. Battery dies fast, but overall, I was happy with it."
"Apple",4,"I had originally owned a Droid X2, and I got it off a Groupon. Well that should have been my first red flag because the phone was only $25 (including a case, screen protector, and bluetooth). Out of frustration, I purchased the iPhone 4 in hopes that it would be a dramatic improvement compared to my Droid X2. I purchased it used, in very good condition. Aside from a minor scratch on the screen, the phone was in very good condition. The only problem I have is the home button. It either sticks, or it doesn't work immediately. But other than that, the phone itself is awesome and unless another Droid comes my way that can take the cake, I'm sticking to the iPhone."
"Apple",1,"did my best to get in touch with you for a change of equipment, since I received the phone is cdma tegnologia, and does not work in Venezuela, my intention was to file a change for gsm team, but I found it impossible to get any type of response, should pay attention to the requirements of its customers."
"Apple",5,"Phones... People have strong feelings about their cell phones it seems but when it comes down to usability, simplicity and just 'working' pretty much all of the time, still no one does it better than Apple and the iPhone.I know you can customize the Droids more here and there, I know there's no widgets, no this and no that. But there's also more security, more safety, more updates that roll out to everyone as soon as they're ready, more people using an iPhone 4 who still get to use pretty much the same features as the iPhone 5 because the software is available for both phones at the same time.The app selection is better, the best apps come out for iPhone first and the screen is great now that they've put the whole 'Retina Display' thing out there, the only real negative is the screen size, which in today's world, should really be bigger than 3.5"". Unless you have a very specific need for an Android, most users will find the iPhone just perfect for what they want to do."
"Apple",5,"I like love my new Iphone, had an issue activating it at first cause the Verizob lady told me it was through US Cellular but I got it all taken care of."
"Apple",5,"excellent product arrived on time and very good quality 100% recommended . . . . . . . . ."
"Apple",5,"I bought the phone and ship to Singapore.But I found that the phone cannot be used outside of US.I should take responsibility for the mistake.But the seller almost refund me all the payment.And save me a lot of lost.Thanks very much."
"Apple",4,"The charger didn't even fit into the iPhone has to be something wrong with this picture... And the headphone was not great too.. It was an iPhone 1 headphone while I got the iPhone 4. The iPhone was in great condition and liked it very much."
"Apple",5,"I ordered this IPhone because it came with a 30 day manufacturer warranty. Needless to say I haven't had to worry about using it. The condition said good-used and it was good the only part that wasn't the best was a little rubbing on the putter metal part from being in an otter box it's entire life. I'm very happy with my 1st iPhone I am happily converted from being an android lover! 😃"
"Apple",5,"very good phone, had no problems with it."
"Apple",5,"Love it!"
"Apple",5,"love it"
"Apple",4,"Seller is Legit, I bought a $68 Verizon iPhone 4 32gb- and it came with a free wall charger. ‘’Sooo happy’’, you should buy from this seller. The only thing about the iPhone 4 model is on the back of the iPhone it says made in China but manufactures in California-( this means it might be an old copy). IT runs on iOS 7.1.2 and has no panorama or other features like iOS 8 or Siri."
"Apple",4,"It was what I wanted."
"Apple",5,"It arrive quickly and in perfect working order."
"Apple",1,"Was disappointed with the phone from day one . I dealt with it as I was due for an upgrade in a few months. I would not recommend buying a refurbished phone from anyone."
"Apple",5,"great item thanks"
"Apple",5,"The phone was shipped right away and was as advertised."
"Apple",5,"Why spern so much on a new phone when mine has been serving me for almost a year now, will upgrade with another used phone when the price goes down"
"Apple",5,"As described"
"Apple",5,"GREAT SERVICE ALL AROUND! VERY HAPPY WITH MY PURCHASE."
"Apple",5,"It's nice and works just fine,"
"Apple",5,"Love my phone it's perfect in every way!"
"Apple",1,"sound was muffled when using phone."
"Apple",1,"didn't realize it was a verizon phone and could not use it. wasted my money."
"Apple",5,"Purchased as a gift for my nephew."
"Apple",5,"I am very happy with my purchase. I got exactly what I wanted and couldn't be more happier!!!!"
"Apple",5,"Great product for a good price."
"Apple",5,"Item delivered on time, was as described."
"Apple",5,"I got a great price, and it arrived on time for Christmas. It actually arrived ahead of the promised date. My daughter, who received the phone as a gift is very happy with it."
"Apple",5,"we like the price like the product it doesn't had any scratchlike the gigabites,the color and special because it was in good condition"
"Apple",2,"This phone doesn't pull as many reception bars as my black phone. It does most things except complete calls well. That's the trouble. What good is a phone that doesn't do its main job of completing phone calls well? And even though it was brand new, Apple said, ""It's from an outside vendor, and you're on your own.""Too bad."
"Apple",5,"At first I was almost sure I was going to get scammed because this was such a great deal! It works perfectly and I couldn't be more satisfied with my new iPhone 4. Love it! Thank you!"
"Apple",5,"Problem, scratch, and blemish free, just the way it should be :) why buy a new iPhone? :) :) :)"
"Apple",1,"It is great althought my home button only works half the time and so i have to hit it several times to get back to my home screen from anywhere. Not good!"
"Apple",4,"I bought the 'Used - very good' condition. There were some slight scratch marks and some 'dirt' in the speaker slots and other cavities. Other than that, I've had it for almost 2 months now and no issues so far."
"Apple",1,"I spent two hours on the phone to activate it for it to not even be a Verizon phone. Its made for AT&T. Very unhappy."
"Apple",3,"I purchased this phone for use overseas, only to learn AFTER I received it that there wasn't a GSM Chip Slot. I currently use an iPhone 4 and it does have the GSM Slot, I had no idea the newer ones or from Verizon did not.I will now have to try and sell this item and get one GSM ready.Gary"
"Apple",3,"I bought the phone it looks great no scratches nothing it was a used phone the only problem was the batterie dies in about an hour and sometimes doesn't even turn back on it takes about 30 minutes. I tried contacting amazon and they told me to check with apple but apple didn't do anything."
"Apple",5,"VERY satisfied:) Quick delivery."
"Apple",5,"great!"
"Apple",5,"Great Buy"
"Apple",1,"Saw it listed as a 4S with a SIM card. No SIM card and it is still locked to Verison. Waste of money"
"Apple",5,"Fast shipping -new - nice!"
"Apple",2,"Phone was described as ""refurbished"". Well, that may have been true, the reality was that the WiFi worked horribly, and the primary button worked intermittently. Overall, trying to save money by purchasing a refurbished iPhone was a mistake ... the good part - Verizon had a sale this weekend and was awarded a $300 gift card when trading in a ""working smart phone"". Now I have a new 6s iPhone ☺"
"Apple",5,"Listing said refurbished but you'd never know--looks like a brand new phone sealed in the box. Works great and arrived quickly."
"Apple",5,"Great!"
"Apple",5,"Hooked up to service and works great!"
"Apple",5,"Perfect"
"Apple",5,"Mine was listed as ""Used"" and in ""Good"" condition. What arrived was a factory new phone that had the shrink wrap removed the box so it could be sold as ""used"". I can't say that you will receive the same but I am very happy with mine!"
"Apple",2,"I received the iphone in good condition. The problem I had was that I could not capitalize any words which was a problem. Other than that the phone was as advertised. I returned the phone without any hassles and received a prompt refund."
"Apple",5,"its like a brand new iphone 4s sans the box. Arrived promptly. There was a sticker on the bubble wrap covering the phone stating it was an 8 GB phone so for a bit I thought I had been duped. But then checked the iphone memory and it is indeed a 32 GB.Very pleased!!!!!"
"Apple",4,"Came with a weird screen but everything was functioning properly. I bought it used, so it was better than expected."
"Apple",3,"Due to a number of factors I decided to downgrade from an iPhone 5 to an iPhone 4 - wish I wouldn't have done that. The service, delivery and price was good but the phone was certainly a step down."
"Apple",2,"love the phone but was a little disappointed when I found out the bottom left speaker wasnt working and the ad said fully functional."
"Apple",5,"It is great to receive a phone that was affordable its so easy to use screen is easy to see"
"Apple",4,"I am very happy with this phone. It was a gift for my son. Just wish there were more directions included ."
"Apple",5,"Not only was this phone everything I expected, it came earlier than projected!! This was a great buying experience and I would use this merchant again for any similar purchase."
"Apple",5,"I was worried about purchasing this phone due to the other reviews I read, however it came brand new as promised. Everything works well except for the speaker phone. I don't ever really use it so its not a huge deal."
"Apple",5,"As advertised"
"Apple",1,"Returned after 2 days horrible phone got my refund asap."
"Apple",5,"Have had it for a year and it is still going strong. I am getting the new Iphone 6 though. Sometimes the home button doesn't work but that never has bothered me."
"Apple",5,"Thank you so much Amazon, and FedEx without the both of you joining forces I would not have had my day made by receiving my package from coast-to-coast in less than 24 hours. This is beyond exceptionally outstanding work. And I am very pleased, thank you once again very much."
"Apple",2,"The face of the phone is cracked and the buttons stick really bad!"
"Apple",5,"It's great! It arrived way before it said it would its brand new (until I dropped it and the back spiderwebbed :( but the front didn't break!) great overall experience :)"
"Apple",3,"terrible service with straight talk in areas where the other phone works perfectly under the same provider"
"Apple",1,"I was told I was buying a new phone, not a refurbished one. Very upsetting, but it works mostly well. It goes a little crazy when I put the phone in silent mode and the head jack input was dirty (also works mostly well). But I afraid that this phone won't last. I guess if you want new you should buy straight from apple."
"Apple",4,"Ordered from nu two, came really fast. Great condition except it seems one of the speakers is not working. But headphone jack works great with my headphones and speakers. Only bought to replace my iPod touch 4th gen that had been thru ringer, dropped,cracked, home button stuck ,dropped in puddle. Needed an upgrade and always secretly liked iPhone even though I have only ever had lgs and blackberry and samsung. For less than $100 definitely great buy!!"
"Apple",1,"I sent it back."
"Apple",3,"The camera takes fuzzy pictures but otherwise the phone is fine. It was very clean, like new, as advertised but what is with that camera."
"Apple",3,"I had to return this product as it was not the one I was looking for ! It was ordered accidentally ,I needed GSM instead of CDMA.I face difficulty in returning this product but thanks to Amazon customer service which supported me well."
"Apple",4,"Ok delivery was very speedy 4-5 days...!! Phone was in great condition physically. The camera was damaged tho. Flash was no good! Overall, i didnt get what i ordered; which was an unlocked sim card enabled device, therfore i had to return it asap.:("
"Apple",5,"I bought this iPhone 4, It is in new condition. It arrived promptly. Excellent seller. now I am looking for someone to unlock this great phone here in Venezuela!!!!!!"
"Apple",5,"I bought the iPhone 4 for my wife. It is in new condition. It arrived promptly. My wife absolutely loves it. Excellent seller. Highly recommend.Jerry"
"Apple",5,"This 32gb iphone let's me download what I want I don't have to keep seeing how much space I have left because I know I have more than enough on board and the phone is in good condition! Love it"
"Apple",1,"As mentioned in numerous other reviews, the trade in service for phones is a scam. I sent my phone in with a ""good"" rating which is described as ""shows wear from normal use"" and ""light scratches on the body."" My phone was exactly as described. It looked like it had been used, but was in no way, shape or form ""heavily scratched."" Long story short I got $100 less on my trade-in because, as the email stated, it was ""heavily scratched."" That is quite a stretch of the truth and rather insulting. If you plan to trade a phone in, expect to get the absolute minimum amount regardless of the condition."
"Apple",3,"The phone was in good shape like promised but you would think that if someone just paid 254.00 for a USED phone that it would at least come with a phone charger. Plus the phone didn't have the capibility of being activated from the phone. So not only do I have to go up to the verizon store to PAY to have it activated but I also have to spend more money for a charger."
"Apple",1,"Camera looks like I was standing in a cloud of smoke. I loved the camera on my old phone but this one is completely useless. I wouldn't buy another used phone ever."
"Apple",5,"While the phone was as described, it was not 'unlocked' as was touted. It was locked to AT&T. I had to pay to get it usable in my part of the globe. I would buy from this seller again."
"Apple",4,"Was just as I expected ecelent"
"Apple",3,"My kid is happy with it"
"Apple",5,"Got on time. No issues in activating for Verizon. Phone is in excellent condition and works great!"
"Apple",4,"in excellent condition other than normal wear and tear. my only thing is no siri"
"Apple",5,"Thank you."
"Apple",3,"Yes I Have now. All is perfect, but I made a mistake, that cellphone is CDMA and in my contry does not work, but is may fault. Any way is perfect . I am going to buy something called gmate and with that is going to workl here."
"Apple",5,"needed a phone badly since I lost mine. when I got it, it wasn't in perfect condition but it was pretty good with some minor scuffs around the edges."
"Apple",5,"Cheaper than an ipod! I love it. Bought it refurbished and it came in awesome condition. Works great!"
"Apple",5,"Gave it to my granddaughter for Christmas. Works great."
"Apple",2,"Beautiful phone! The sound didn't work though..."
"Apple",4,"Phone came in great condition, looks brand new! Activated without problems and is the 32gb as ordered. Came in the box with the charger and headphones. Snapchat is acting a little funny and the emoji keyboard but other than that no problems at all. Verizon said I got a great deal!"
"Apple",5,"Was brand new in all the apple packaging complete with headphones and a charger. Was exactly as described by the seller. Extremely happy with this purchase. Great price especially now that apple has stopped producing 32 GB iPhone 4 and most cell services don't sell them."
"Apple",4,"Great!"
"Apple",2,"the phone was said to be fully functional, I quote ""The device is tested & 100% fully functional"". but the camera does not work and that is one of the main reasons I bought this phone. the seller should've mentioned that the camera is bogus. Very disappointed!!!!"
"Apple",5,"The iPhone was new and in the box as described. I received it quickly and in good condition. Well satisified."
"Apple",2,"home button does not work!"
"Apple",1,"That suck this company sale phone with somebody all account I'm un happy.and good luck to new costumer."
"Apple",5,"When I order the phone I had mixed reaction when I look at the reviews but when I gotten the iPhone all those fears were put to rest cause it works great"
"Apple",3,"i normally get great products from warehouse deals but some reason this time i got the phone and when i stuck the headsets in the phone couldnt hear a thing. got new headsets and it still didnt work"
"Apple",5,"Item as described and exactly what I wanted. Shipping was very quick."
"Apple",5,"still using it !!! came like brand spanking new so very pleased with is no problems just a great phone I love love love it thanks so much"
"Apple",5,"I'm extremely satisfied with this purchase . It came in the box brand new and perfect! I bought another one for a friend."
"Apple",5,"This used iphone 4 was in ridiculously great condition. The price was similar or better than other used or refurbished iphones with less GB storage. My teenage son was getting this as a replacement phone until our contract is up for renewal and he can get a new one. Now he's not sure he wants a new one."
"Apple",1,"Wasn't able to activate it the phone is still under someone else contract so it was useless . Had to return . Still waiting on my refund. Please make sure esn is clean before u sell another"
"Apple",5,"Wonderful phone altogether for a wonderful price....Very very satisfied.....Purchased w. a SquareTrade 1-Year Accident Protection Plan for Prepaid Cell Phone just to make sure everything was covered....As of yet have not had to use it *fingerscrossed :-D Again, a very wonderful device! Came quickly and had no signs of flaws or wear and tear (the phone literally looked brand new!) Just keep in mind if buying this device; it is a VERIZON iPhone which means IT COMES WITH NO SIM CARDS SLOT, it will have to be activated by an associate of iOTA (internet over the air)......Again, a perfect device! Would most definately do business with the seller again! Keep up the great work!"
"Apple",5,"It took me a long time to get on board with the updating to a smart phone, and I really don't know what I was thinking. Some advice though: make sure you are buying a genuine apple phone and GET INSURANCE! I bought the 32 gb iPhone, and two weeks later dropped it in water. When I took it to an apple store, they said it had been hampered with and thus they couldn't replace it unless I wanted to pay $750.So then I had to buy another one (obviously I couldn't go back to not having words with friends)...I bought from an apple dealer and paid a little extra for the warranty. And don't forget the case, because you will drop this everyday."
"Apple",4,"Worked great thanks for the new phone has made a big difference with the available space and came in well before the last day for the arrival"
"Apple",1,"This is definitely not a new phone as the original posting had stated. Sure, the phone looked new when I got it, but it only lasted me about 4 months before the battery started draining and dying at 40%. Not to mention the super lag that came with it. Do not buy this! What a scam."
"Apple",4,"iphone is in good shape - works great - except the on/0ff button on top - this phone is so much easier to operate than my old smart phone."
"Apple",2,"No voice text which I thought all Iphone 4 had :-( obviously my fault for not doing the research and making sure it had the features I wanted..."
"Apple",4,"there were no marks on it and it works perfect. i havnt had any problems with it so far. just like new."
"Apple",5,"its perfect i have no prolbems everyone should buy products off amazon they never let me down and always have the best of everything"
"Apple",4,"The only reason I did not give five stars is because I found out that only the right speaker works, I mostly use it with headphones though or a ihome. It holds a bunch of songs but since I plugged it into my computer itunes flipped out and said it has to be uninstalled but i put a lock so that no one can delete itunes, i cant get into it to unlock the lock so i can only have the songs i have baught on my iphone, not ones that i have on cds. I wish i had the money to use the phone part of it but for now i have my music"
"Apple",5,"great item as they said it was would use them again for any purchase. i cant say enough good things thanks"
"Apple",5,"It works perfectly and I absolutely love it. Best phone I have ever had, even when I was dead set on droid!"
"Apple",5,"32 gigs is an awful lot for a guy who only sends about twenty or so emails a month and receives back less. Phone works great, but my wife's 8 gig one is just enough"
"Apple",5,"I was very impressed with the service and quality of the product I received. The product was shipped immediately and I received it before the expected date. The phone was in perfect (new) condition and I have had no problems with it at all. Activating it was a breeze. I would suggest this seller to anybody!"
"Apple",5,"The phone is awesome and much better than a droid or HTC. I will never go back to a windows based product."
"Apple",1,"I purchased and iPhone 4 32gb from 360Mobile Solutions received the Phone May 2, 2013 and the phone's speaker and microphone did not work and I excused it at first because I needed a phone but on May 20, 2013 the phone went black and completely stopped working. smh. I don't like the fact that 360 did not have away from me to contact them to get their help in solving this problem. I personally thank Amazon for stepping up and helping me out with a total refund. I write this in hope's the 360 Mobile Solutions step their game up to because that was UNACCEPTABLE!"
"Apple",5,"I really have enjoyed my iPhone. The phone came as it was described on picture. I have no complaints and price was great."
"Apple",4,"Pros the price was right. Con can't up date the operating system."
"Apple",2,"No I thought it had a sim card slot..."
"Apple",5,"Excellent brand new in package"
"Apple",5,"Shipping was supper fast and I love it"
"Apple",1,"Battery was dead within a month."
"Apple",5,"It's great!"
"Apple",5,"Was actually a 4S. Nice! Perfect condition"
"Apple",3,"I thought I was the responsible one and didn't pay for the insurance for my phone. Of course I was the one who dropped their phone in the rain and it cracked all over the place. Anyway, I found one on Amazon that was about the price as if I had paid the monthly insurance premium all this time. The home button sticks sometimes but my stepdaughter put a menu icon on the front so I can quickly get the home screen. Kids know all kinds of neat stuff."
"Apple",4,"Arrived early. Exactly as described. One tiny bubble on the edge of the screen, but nothing I would complain about. Overall It's a good phone and new."
"Apple",4,"The phone it's self didn't run as fast as I wanted it to but it is keeping up nicley with my old phone."
"Apple",5,"Worked very well, no scratches. Only one side of the speakers worked but for the price it was great. It was glitchy here & there but it only happened every so often that it wasn't really a problem. Restarted the phone & it was fine. Overall great product & great price. Would recommend."
"Apple",5,"What I wanted . Fine phone."
"Apple",2,"Can't upgrade software to support Twitter......freakin' TWITTER won't run on this thing! Also bluetooth would randomly switch off, phone needed to be rebooted to get it back on. Last straw was it would not respond when I tried to access my voicemail. I'm giving it two stars because even with a cracked screen (lost my temper during the voicemail incident) its 32gb makes it a formidable music player."
"Apple",1,"Home key doesn't work properly I contacted seller no resolution"
"Apple",5,"This was the best iPhone Apple ever had til the IPhone 6S Plus came out. I had my iPhone 4 for many years and never had a problem with it...easy to learn iOS, clear calling, hundreds of thousand apps to try in the App Store...If this is your first iPhone purchase and don't want anything big then this the best phone."
"Apple",5,"nice works good"
"Apple",3,"It served the purpose till upgrade on Verizon kicked in!"
"Apple",5,"If you love Apple, you'll love this affordable phone!"
"Apple",4,"Works good! Thanks"
"Apple",3,"Had to return because I needed the iPhone 4s to run certain apps for business."
"Apple",1,"The phone I bought through Amazon was stolen. When I went to have it activated at the Verizon store the sales clerk told me it had been reported stolen. Luckily I was able to get a refund from Amazon. How disappointing! I have not bought one single electronic item from Amazon since and may not in the future due to this experience."
"Apple",5,"I love this phone I was super excited to get this phone, I lost my ipod touch and didn't and decided to get an iphone instead of replacing the ipod. That was one of my best decisions. I would recommend this product to any and everyone."
"Apple",1,"I had a defective speaker in the first month. I sent it back to VERY HQS and they asked if I would take the phone back if they fixed the speaker. I agreed to it for a slight reduction in price. About 2 months after that my home button started having problems. Its gotten now into the fourth month. This is a lemon. I asked for a refund for this phone that keeps having problems. They refused to take it back. Thanks VERY HQS for your customer service."
"Apple",1,"I was excited to get my very first smart phone. The item was purchased as being NEW. I received it and had loved the I Phone until a few days ago when I was only able to make calls using the speaker phone. I took the phone to Apple and they took it apart and informed me that the phone was refurbished-there was not original Apple parts in there so they would not repair the phone. I am not unhappy with Apple or Amazon. But the company that supplied this item-I have never felt to tricked, ripped off, and taken for a ride. Amazon, luckily, was nice enough to at least stand by their promise and issue a full refund, even though the purchase was a bit past the thirty days. Will I use Amazon again? Yes. Apple? Yes. This supplier? NOOOO!! RIP OFF!!!!"
"Apple",4,"Well for one thing i didn't get a new one and when i did get it, it had a very volgure e-mail left on it (rapepornog ) what the rest was i can't remeber, and there was still some chinese writing left on it, i was lucky to get it off, so i really do think ALL THE PHONES SHOOULD BE LOOKED OVER A WHOLE LOT BETTER THAN THEY ARE??????????"
"Apple",1,"Tried to activate this phone and it would not due to the fact that it was a AT & T phone. I would suggest the owner or company of this phone change the title description."
"Apple",5,"when i ordered I thougth that is going to look used, but when i got it. was wrap it as new and when i open it, was perfect clean like a new i i ordered used, and since i buyed is working perfecly."
"Apple",5,"This item was exactly as advertised-in perfect condition, no scratches, and works perfectly. I intended to buy a 4S, but the 4 is great and Siri is not really necessary."
"Apple",3,"though i ve been using the phone regularly i will b taking it to the apple store to exchange it the home button rarely works and the which means i had to put one on the screen and the screen doesnt shut off due to a faulty proxy sensor which means when im talking i either mute people out or im bumping buttons leaving loud beeping noises in the other persons ear"
"Apple",5,"This phone is perfect. It came in the original packaging and works beautifully. More than I expected. I definitely recommend this"
"Apple",4,"Very good....no scratches at all. I love it but the only problem I am facing is a message popping up and say your phone can not be activated however I see the Verizon network. That's funny."
"Apple",5,"I got my iphone earlier. It was as they had described it. I'm very happy with my iphone and the conditions were great.. Thank you!! :)"
"Apple",3,"Phone works really well. I had to take to Verizon store to have activated. However I was expecting a 32gb and only received a16gb so that was disappointing."
"Apple",2,"Apple was 1st in the race with these types of products, and they were great for the first few years, but history has now repeated itself with the Apple Corporation in that they have again fallen asleep with customer needs, no incorporation of new technology, products stale, prices OUTRAGEOUS on ALL their products, and so many other reasons.We have ditched all our apple products and switched to Android products from one company (which I will not name here). In the last 47 years of my life I have never bought an Apple Personal Computer and I have only bought 3 apple devices which we have sold them all. You would think CEOs would have to take a basic freshman 101 course in lessons learned from history, but apparently its beyond their grasp. It has always been amazing to me what their salaries are!"
"Apple",4,"I was not comfortable buying this off line, but it seems to be working great so far. Only time will tell...."
"Apple",4,"Great deal on this phone. I took a big chance and had a lot of doubt. The phone arrived on excellent condition and for the price this was a great deal. Thank you'"
"Apple",4,"Indeed it is a very fabulous phone with details that I have to learn for months.I really like it. Shadrack"
"Apple",1,"The Phone does not work it's crap! It slowly got worse now I'm to the point where I cannot hear my calls!"
"Apple",3,"the phone is new like the description, but the front camera issue and can't use properly.thanks to Amazon and 360 mobile solutions for this withdraw."
"Apple",4,"there were no marks on it and it works perfect. i havnt had any problems with it so far. just like new."
"Apple",1,"When I bought this a while ago, I was buying a 32GB phone. Then when I got the phone, the phone was reported stolen. The seller immediately responded to my claim and he sent me a new phone. Except the new one was only a 16 GB phone and it was hard to hear people when I was on a call. I also paid the amount for a 32 GB phone and ended up with a 16 GB phone that came with a bonus ""box."" Then the hearing part went completely out, so I just bought a new phone from Verizon."
"Apple",5,"OK. Good purchase!!"
"Apple",3,"I received the cell phone really quickly and ive been using it since... its a little sluggish at times but its managable but the one thing that pissed me off about it is that the sound only comes out of one of the speakers and at one time, the sound wasn't even working. literally have to slam the phone on the back then the sound came back on....."
"Apple",4,"bluetooth doesnt workits a tad glitchy now and thencharging is a tad spotty and slow at timesit can get really laggybut i can live with all these things"
"Apple",5,"great for music"
"Apple",4,"It was sad the only reason I bough it was to stream my disney movies at that time you could only do it with an IPhone"
"Apple",5,"Great"
"Apple",5,"Great value"
"Apple",1,"Not unlocked"
"Apple",5,"I wouldn't have purchased this phone. It was used and had negative reviews. BUT I bought it for my grandson with HIS money and thought at the time that I would be teaching him a lesson. Instead HE taught me a lesson. The phone looked new. It does everything it's supposed to do. He LOVES it!! What more can you ask? It arrived quickly and the transaction was effortless. He always wanted an IPhone and after going through many other brands of less quality finally decided to get one he could afford. 5 stars for delivering as promised in a condition better than promised and for making my grandson very happy!"
"Apple",5,"Great ui on iOS 7"
"Apple",1,"When attempted to activate it was reported as a stolen device."
"Apple",1,"Phone accordingly is new but upon checked by apple store it is fake. Could not get any cell signal."
"Apple",5,"Great phone but the description needed to be clearer."
"Apple",1,"hello good morning, this is to place you iphone sim card? for use in Venezuela thank you waiting for your reply"
"Apple",5,"I purchased this to replace my son's stolen iphone. This phone arrived quickly, brand new in original packaging. It is working very well on our Verizon network. We are well pleased."
"Apple",5,"It's been a year & this phone still runs great with a good battery. The unlocked version is perfect for people who switch plans a lot. A great purchase for anyone deciding on using an iPhone."
"Apple",5,"I had previously bought an iPhone 4 from a different seller, which had turned out to be defective. This one was cheater and works like a charm! Amazing!"
"Apple",5,"downgraded from v 5 & very happy... needs to last until my contract comes do. May not trade it in."
"Apple",5,"I had before a Samsung iii, very expensive cellphone, nice, big screen, but for some reason my wife didn't like it, so we decided to buy an iphone and give it a try.This is definitely a good product, fast response, excellent sensor on the touch screen, nice, clean... and the best of all was that we paid a reasonable price for this refurbished item, which looks like new, with minor blemished. my wife is really happy and now she just need to learn how to use it."
"Apple",1,"I thought I was buying what was listed. But I received a different GB of phone than I had paid for. She did pay me the difference of the item I got and what I had originally paid for. But I am still upset because that's not what I wanted, and the phone wasn't unlocked."
"Apple",5,"I was scared i would have gotten an iphone that was cracked with scratches or something, but when it arrived it looked brand new like no one has ever used it. I was very impressed!(: i love the phone, so glad i ordered it, everything came with it. it was a great price too! (:"
"Apple",3,"Add more description to the phone because when i had received mine the home button had some problems and did not want to work sometimes. also with the phone speakers, i am a person of music i like to always listen to music but when the speakers do not work fully it disappointed me. overall the phone was a great buy and i really enjoy it"
"Apple",1,"The phone looked in great shape when I received it...however at first I noticed it was a bit slower than my previous iPhones. After a couple weeks it was very evident the phone was not processing well. Here we are 2 months later and besides using it as a phone, everything else is so slow that I cant browse or check email unless I have 15 minutes to wait and reopen the application multiple times. I am very disappointed in this product"
"Apple",5,"I can't complain about he phone at all I love it a lot. I would let everyone know about it"
"Apple",5,"Very pleased with my purchase, all new and works great. I will use the net for all my shopping from now on."
"Apple",3,"Everything is fine except the home button only works half the time. But the price was pretty low and it's otherwise fully functional."
"Apple",4,"I'm in Guangzhou, China received Iphone4 32GB, overall is very good. Is the screen and border wear more often, it was a very good deal. Using Chinese telecommunications services."
"Apple",1,"The only big problem of this iphone is that i can't used because the phone is locked.SO NOW WHAT? -.-"
"Apple",5,"Thank you the phone looks like it is brand new and works great! Couldnt be more happy with the product. highly recommended!"
"Apple",1,"The charger didn't work"
"Apple",2,"Has decent functions but very slow phone. And there is no option to make it to where when on phone calls the screen closes or locks so your face make you push buttons constantly or you conference in other calls. That's a major disappointment always have to use speaker I you don't want that to happen."
"Apple",3,"When I opened it, it had a large crack near the camera."
"Apple",3,"I wouldn't buy a Iphone 4 after having the 5C. The navigation is impossible."
"Apple",2,"it worked well for 2 weeks but now the screen ""spasms"" all the time. I cant take photos and often cant select an icon while this is going on."
"Apple",1,"My phone don't even work half the time"
"Apple",1,"This phone is unable to use in other countries, don't buy it if you need to use outside USA !!!!! I bought it unloocked but it didn't works."
"Apple",5,"Loved that phone wish I still had it"
"Apple",5,"I got my phone a week earlier than expected & it works perfectly :)"
"Apple",5,"Very fast shipping-great product- works great:)"
"Apple",5,"Everything as described. Will buy from again."
"Apple",5,"Item came just as expected, and was well packed. I had to return mine, though, because the friend I got it for got a new phone the day after it arrived."
"Apple",1,"I bought this phone to replace my old one through verizon, however I know that phones have a tendency to break so I bought a warranty as well. I can't get my money back for either and now I am out a phone and $190. Don't waste your money because mine broke, the power button and home button has a lot of issues. I won't be buying anything else through Amazon anymore because of how everything was taken care of."
"Apple",1,"battery dead top power off button not working sent back"
"Apple",4,"It works great but would like a bigger screen."
"Apple",5,"Luv it!!!"
"Apple",5,"This I phone is wonderful, I realize it is an older model, but for our first smart phone it works great!"
"Apple",5,"It did exactly what I needed it to do."
"Apple",1,"It arrived and the microphone didn't work. Do NOT buy from these people."
"Apple",5,"Worked very well, no scratches. Only one side of the speakers worked but for the price it was great. It was glitchy here & there but it only happened every so often that it wasn't really a problem. Restarted the phone & it was fine. Overall great product & great price. Would recommend."
"Apple",4,"Met my expectations"
"Apple",5,"First I want to say that I purchased this new, through Amazon. The phone was as described, new and with all the accessories. Had no trouble activating it with Verizon and I am very happy with the purchase. It is a good basic i phone at a fair price!"
"Apple",5,"Awesome"
"Apple",4,"Good experience"
"Apple",5,"this iphone was okay but I found out before sending the product back that it doesn't have siri or even facetime. I sent it back right away without opening the box."
"Apple",5,"my son loves his phone. No issues as of yet"
"Apple",5,"So far so good !"
"Apple",5,"It was so clean"
"Apple",5,"Was on time and very satisfied"
"Apple",4,"Pros the price was right. Con can't up date the operating system."
"Apple",5,"Muito bom"
"Apple",5,"Perfect condition not a scratch came on time couldn't be happier works great!!!"
"Apple",1,"Advertised as new but was definitely used before. The phone wouldn't connect to itunes or even my computer. The phone wasn't even showing up in the device manager at all, not even as an unknown device. A day after receiving the phone, the screen got lots of white streaks on it and starts flashing uncontrollably. Basically the phone I received was unusable."
"Apple",1,"this was advertised as New in package. the phone was received with a defect in the screen (shaking icons). after contacting apple, the unit was identified as a ""refurbished"" phone. ""refurbished"" does NOT equal NEW."
"Apple",5,"Wonderful item. Great purchase"
"Apple",5,"We received the phone on time &!it was exactly in the condition promised. We were very happy with everything! Thanx"
"Apple",5,"This phone is amazing except one of my speakers didn't work when I took it out of the package."
"Apple",5,"Perfect! Very pleased! It was listed as like new and was indeed in new condition. The phone is working great (on Net10) and no regrets on this purchase!"
"Apple",4,"Good phone but probably paid more than I should have!"
"Apple",1,"defective phone that was received later than the express date that was paid for."
"Apple",5,"we like the price like the product it doesn't had any scratchlike the gigabites,the color and special because it was in good condition"
"Apple",2,"This phone doesn't pull as many reception bars as my black phone. It does most things except complete calls well. That's the trouble. What good is a phone that doesn't do its main job of completing phone calls well? And even though it was brand new, Apple said, ""It's from an outside vendor, and you're on your own.""Too bad."
"Apple",5,"At first I was almost sure I was going to get scammed because this was such a great deal! It works perfectly and I couldn't be more satisfied with my new iPhone 4. Love it! Thank you!"
"Apple",5,"Problem, scratch, and blemish free, just the way it should be :) why buy a new iPhone? :) :) :)"
"Apple",1,"It is great althought my home button only works half the time and so i have to hit it several times to get back to my home screen from anywhere. Not good!"
"Apple",4,"I bought the 'Used - very good' condition. There were some slight scratch marks and some 'dirt' in the speaker slots and other cavities. Other than that, I've had it for almost 2 months now and no issues so far."
"Apple",1,"I spent two hours on the phone to activate it for it to not even be a Verizon phone. Its made for AT&T. Very unhappy."
"Apple",3,"I purchased this phone for use overseas, only to learn AFTER I received it that there wasn't a GSM Chip Slot. I currently use an iPhone 4 and it does have the GSM Slot, I had no idea the newer ones or from Verizon did not.I will now have to try and sell this item and get one GSM ready.Gary"
"Apple",3,"I bought the phone it looks great no scratches nothing it was a used phone the only problem was the batterie dies in about an hour and sometimes doesn't even turn back on it takes about 30 minutes. I tried contacting amazon and they told me to check with apple but apple didn't do anything."
"Apple",3,"The camera takes fuzzy pictures but otherwise the phone is fine. It was very clean, like new, as advertised but what is with that camera."
"Apple",5,"very satisfied thank you"
"Apple",3,"I had an iPhone 4, that I only replaced because I switched from AT&T to Verizon. This phone was great when it arrived, but about 6 months later, I now don't have reliable sound unless I have headphones plugged in or it is on a dock. My alarms still go off, and sometimes it rings, so it's not the speakers or anything, just a software issue I guess. I new I was taking a risk when buying a used phone from Amazon, so I can't be horribly upset, but I'm now thinking hard about whether I'll ever do that again."
"Apple",5,"good"
"Apple",5,"Thanks for the phone."
"Apple",5,"This stuff was great I love amazon"
"Apple",5,"Great phone and awesome seller!!!! VERY FAST SHIPPING!! Highly recommend!!! Thanks!!"
"Apple",4,"My sister loves it except the volume button does not work and one of the speakers are blown out.... Crap for the money you pay."
"Apple",1,"Product arrived quickly, looked great, but the headset input didn't work so I returned it."
"Apple",1,"phone speaker not working, and bottom button intermittant."
"Apple",5,"As described"
"Apple",5,"ok got the phone in 3 day after ordering. i went with the shipping set up amazon pre assigned. did not pay anything extra. brand new in box sealed. it is just as advertised. t has an update available to iOS 7 upon set up if you go to settings then general and tell it look for update. it comes with iOS 6 . yes FaceTime is available. i would recommend alpha cell via amazon. i am a happy camper. have not set up with verizon yet wanted make sure it worked first. worst case its an iPod.http://www.verizonwireless.com/support/how-to-activate-apple-iphone-4/including activation set up from Verizon. not easy to find. must do this before attempting to make Verizon account. make sure everything you do is on the prepaid account side. last note here the 30 day prepaid account is unlimited talk text and web. the 30 dollar card gets you the whole month. I paid with 2 15 dollar cards to make the 30."
"Apple",1,"Horrible don't buy. Glitches"
"Apple",5,"The phone looks great and exceeds expectations. It has a heft that makes me realize it's a phone and no longer am iPod!"
"Apple",5,"Great"
"Apple",5,"Still working until now, excellent"
"Apple",5,"Excellant"
"Apple",2,"The phone I bought would only hold a charge for 6 hours, very disappointed."
"Apple",1,"No one can hear you talk on it. Can only talk with the speaker phone or via Wifi with another device.Totally bummed. Returning it as soon as I find another phone!Thought the ""deal"" was too good. And it came wrapped in a Iphone 4 box and all, and it sure looked New!Too bad it does not work. I can't walk around using the speaker phone, and I am not using an ear piece.Perfect if you dont actually want to talk on it!"
"Apple",5,"Amazing"
"Apple",2,"Item looks good, no scratches or blemishes. But turns off and then on randomly for no reason. Doesn't seem like something a ""new"" phone should do."
"Apple",5,"Good"
"Apple",3,"It didn't meet my expectation because it had no sim slot available."
"Apple",1,"I hate the iPhone I purchased and am now searching to replace it. I will never buy another iPhone."
"Apple",1,"Volume would not work..."
"Apple",4,"The home button doesn't work all the time but it is a used phone and I can work around the home button. Arrived promptly with no problems."
"Apple",5,"Awesome buy! I appreciate the nice communication between seller and I. Phone is in great condition and also came with a case and phone charger! Thank you"
"Apple",1,"I want my money back!! What a disappoint :( never expected this to happen to me "
"Apple",1,"The bluetooth doesn't work since I bought it, bad, bad, bad"
"Apple",1,"So bad"
"Apple",5,"very good phone, had no problems with it."
"Apple",1,"I am not satisfied with the product. The phone constantly freezes up and will not function at all for several minutes and this gets VERY ANNOYING. Sometimes when I talk on my phone people tell me they cannot hear me and it sounds like I am talking through a tunnel. I have not contacted the company to request a refund or exchange because I have been super busy."
"Apple",3,"great phone as advertised shipping is great will recommend"
"Apple",1,"The screen went black after 2weeks of use. I have tried everything and it want come on. This is the second phone i have purchased off of here and they never work over 2weeks."
"Apple",5,"32 GB really made the difference for me - more music, more apps and it was in perfect condition. Thanks Folks"
"Apple",4,"Just like new for a fraction of the price. My daughter loves it, she uses it all day and night. I would recomend an otter box case they pay for them selves in no time."
"Apple",1,"So far no problems as of yet did find local store n in Columbus ohio where I could buy brand new for 150.00 wish I knew before hand to save the extra money will look around next time"
"Apple",5,"I was about to buy this phone same phone for about 70 bucks more for new out of the box. Saw the same phone in the warehouse section with the Amazon guarantee. So glad i got the warehouse deal. Phone came with a charger like new, no i phone box but who cares."
"Apple",1,"I ordered an iPhone 4 32GB and they sent an 8GB iPhone, was not what i ordered. Let for a trip and had to have someone else send a phone to my address in Florida while trying to work. Total disaster."
"Apple",5,"for the great price it worked and there was no damage when I received it but I already lost it never fails when I buy a apple product."
"Apple",4,"Very good phone my son likes it. It wasn't scratch and was nicely kept. Was very easy to set up on pre paid service."
"Apple",1,"Phone wouldn't work 10 minutes after I got it. I've only had it for 5 hours. When I first turned it on, it took forever and I noticed these lines going across the screen. At first it would go black if I was on it for more than 30 seconds now the screen keeps fading black everytime I try to unlock it and will randomely shut off. Seems to me like water damage because this is what happened to my last iphone I got wet. So in that case this is a scam."
"Apple",5,"this product is great so far bought it for Christmas so don't know how long it will last but the price you cant beat and always amazon is great so well pleased"
"Apple",5,"I love the Apple phone.This is a outstanding deal and phone. I don't like writing a book to tell you about this. Deal"
"Apple",5,"My granddaughter is thrilled with the phone which she will use until the family plan is qualified for renewal and then move up to the latest iPhone available at the time!"
"Apple",1,"This phone was a lemon. It looked great when it arrived, but the battery was near death, and after a few days the Home Button stopped working. The screen wouldn't react to tough, either. It was a very frustrating ordeal. I hope they don't turn around and pass it off onto someone else.It's time to through that baby away."
"Apple",5,"This was a gift for my son. He really likes the phone and keeps it close by all the time."
"Apple",5,"My daughter wanted a iPhone for Christmas! Found this one Cyber Monday for a GREAT deal with all the accessories brand new in the box. Phone works great"
"Apple",4,"Phone was delivered promptly. I was worried that phone may be used or wouldn't connect with Verizon. Phone appears to be new and I had no problems connecting with Verizon. I have issues with several apps, but I don't consider that the seller's fault. Phone won't download entire I-tunes library and the maps doesn't have a voice feature. ."
"Apple",5,"Works like an absolute charm. The seller got this too me EXTREMELY speedy and was extremely nice. Never ever had any problem with it and I've had it for almost 2 months now. Works beautifully."
"Apple",5,"Phone was in great shape just as promised in original box daughter was very happy."
"Apple",5,"I was able to load all of my music onto this phone."
"Apple",5,"VERY happy with my purchase!!! It was a Christmas gift for my husband and he adores it. Uses it every minute of the day! Thanks for a great product and super speedy delivery!"
"Apple",1,"Very disappointed with purchase I'm having problems sending mail with the iPhone and now my iPad as well. The aol.com email doesn't send my email but I'm receiving my email to my email account! When I try to send a message it says that the password or the username is incorrect! Please help? Thank you!"
"Apple",4,"I like it, the big memory is good for the music I like!"
"Apple",1,"Worked for 7 days and then wouldn't charge or even come back on."
"Apple",5,"Great price, 69.99. arrived quickly and works perfectly. Appears to be brand new."
"Apple",5,"Awesome produce, awesome price. Thank you so much"
"Apple",5,"My kids love these phones! They have used them for over 6 months without any problems."
"Apple",1,"This phone has no SIMM slot - pretty much worthless if you want to use with any carrier."
"Apple",5,"As advertised"
"Apple",5,"Good"
"Apple",1,"They listed the product as NEW and it is VERY USED."
"Apple",1,"Camera lens was vary bad could not use buttons does not work"
"Apple",4,"With any used item that you purchase you're taking a chance but with this item it's in really good shape other than the home button is non responsive at times. Overall it's a good purchase.."
"Apple",1,"It was no clear for us whose first language is not English the description of the cell. It is impossible to use it here in Brazil ans mt purychase, mt money was lost. I wrote a message for you, but there wasn't any answer. So, sadly, it was my first and my last purchase.Sibcerely yiurs,Denise Batista da Luz"
"Apple",5,"excellent"
"Apple",1,"phone is ridiculously slow"
"Apple",5,"Perfect!"
"Apple",5,"perfect"
"Apple",4,"My only issue is that the volume keys stopped working after a couple weeks. Not necessarily caused by seller, but annoying to have to turn the volume up and down on the screen only."
"Apple",5,"got this for my son he loves it great prize great phone"
"Apple",1,"Constantly froze up. Very slow."
"Apple",1,"On amazon the say that the phone is 32GB and the bring me an iphone 16Gb and the back camera is not good and its not a gsm phone. I work hard to have money..."
"Apple",4,"Sometimes glitches but other than that, arrived on time & works well"
"Apple",1,"This phone is water damage"
"Apple",5,"Really great! Haven't had an issue with it. Exactly as described. Extremely fast shipping. Got it the fat after I ordered it! :)"
"Apple",5,"Happy with this purchase:-)Speedy shipping."
"Apple",5,"Excelent!!!"
"Apple",3,"when i text it doesn't have any smilie faces that i'm able to send or some other things that i don't know how to used"
"Apple",4,"Great phone . I would give 5 stars but they sent us a AT&T phone first.once we got our Verizon phone everything went great . No problems at all."
"Apple",5,"What I wanted . Fine phone."
"Apple",2,"Can't upgrade software to support Twitter......freakin' TWITTER won't run on this thing! Also bluetooth would randomly switch off, phone needed to be rebooted to get it back on. Last straw was it would not respond when I tried to access my voicemail. I'm giving it two stars because even with a cracked screen (lost my temper during the voicemail incident) its 32gb makes it a formidable music player."
"Apple",1,"Home key doesn't work properly I contacted seller no resolution"
"Apple",5,"This was the best iPhone Apple ever had til the IPhone 6S Plus came out. I had my iPhone 4 for many years and never had a problem with it...easy to learn iOS, clear calling, hundreds of thousand apps to try in the App Store...If this is your first iPhone purchase and don't want anything big then this the best phone."
"Apple",5,"nice works good"
"Apple",3,"It served the purpose till upgrade on Verizon kicked in!"
"Apple",5,"If you love Apple, you'll love this affordable phone!"
"Apple",4,"Works good! Thanks"
"Apple",3,"Had to return because I needed the iPhone 4s to run certain apps for business."
"Apple",5,"💜"
"Apple",5,"GREAT SERVICE ALL AROUND! VERY HAPPY WITH MY PURCHASE."

"Apple",5,"Love my phone it's perfect in every way!"
"Apple",1,"sound was muffled when using phone."
"Apple",1,"didn't realize it was a verizon phone and could not use it. wasted my money."
"Apple",5,"Purchased as a gift for my nephew."
"Apple",5,"I am very happy with my purchase. I got exactly what I wanted and couldn't be more happier!!!!"
"Apple",5,"Great product for a good price."
"Apple",5,"Item delivered on time, was as described."
"Apple",2,"excellent"
"Apple",1,"I've barely owned this two months and it already fails me. The sound/speakers work fine with everything EXCEPT when it comes to notifying me of incoming calls/texts/etc. Oh sure, the alarm works when I need to get up in the morning for work, and for playing podcasts, videos, and music. But what's the point of a phone when a call or text comes in and I have NO idea? Horribly inconvenient. I didn't buy this phone for fun, I need it to COMMUNICATE. This is my first Apple device and truly the biggest regret I've ever purchased. If only my financial situation allowed me to make this right - to buy a new/better phone - but, dang. I'm screwed over and there's not much I can do about it. Thanks Apple."
"Apple",5,"Good"
"Apple",3,"It didn't meet my expectation because it had no sim slot available."
"Apple",1,"I hate the iPhone I purchased and am now searching to replace it. I will never buy another iPhone."
"Apple",1,"Volume would not work..."
"Apple",4,"The home button doesn't work all the time but it is a used phone and I can work around the home button. Arrived promptly with no problems."
"Apple",5,"Awesome buy! I appreciate the nice communication between seller and I. Phone is in great condition and also came with a case and phone charger! Thank you"
"Apple",1,"I want my money back!! What a disappoint :( never expected this to happen to me "
"Apple",1,"The bluetooth doesn't work since I bought it, bad, bad, bad"
"Apple",1,"So bad"
"Apple",2,"My aunt does not like it. Only the first owner of the phone can unlock it. In addition, it comes with a MEID number instead of IMEID which needs to be verified before using the phone. My aunt informs me that she is thinking of returning the phone."
"Apple",4,"service was great, iPhone is a 4, all I could afford, and slow compared to my 4g. Still, I like the phone."
"Apple",1,"I purchased this phone in June 2014, and now October of 2014, not even 5 months later I have to have the button that turns it off and on replaced. Not a happy person!"
"Apple",5,"sold it and bought it back works well"
"Apple",1,"Very disappointed with this phone. The charger base never worked from day one. It has given me constant trouble. It even wiped out all my contacts, pictures, and texts. I will have to bring it to the Apple store to see if they can fix it."
"Apple",1,"NO SIM VERZION"
"Apple",5,"fast shipping. recieved better than described. only negative was phone was left on during shipping"
"Apple",5,"Just as described. Fast delivery"
"Apple",1,"The phone didn't work..the sensor was broken so every time I tried to make a call it would continually dial. The battery was Also broken, the phone wouldn't keep a charge"
"Apple",5,"Great! Fast shipping! Good product!"
"Apple",5,"VERY satisfied:) Quick delivery."
"Apple",5,"great!"
"Apple",5,"Great Buy"
"Apple",1,"Saw it listed as a 4S with a SIM card. No SIM card and it is still locked to Verison. Waste of money"
"Apple",5,"Fast shipping -new - nice!"
"Apple",2,"Phone was described as ""refurbished"". Well, that may have been true, the reality was that the WiFi worked horribly, and the primary button worked intermittently. Overall, trying to save money by purchasing a refurbished iPhone was a mistake ... the good part - Verizon had a sale this weekend and was awarded a $300 gift card when trading in a ""working smart phone"". Now I have a new 6s iPhone ☺"
"Apple",5,"Listing said refurbished but you'd never know--looks like a brand new phone sealed in the box. Works great and arrived quickly."
"Apple",5,"Great!"
"Apple",5,"Hooked up to service and works great!"
"Apple",5,"Perfect"
"Apple",1,"Phone was locked. Verizon suggested it was a stolen phone."
"Apple",5,"Love it - just like the one I drowned. I neethrohded the memory for my music and all and none of the 5's available through Verizon has 32 gig. I could have upgraded with them but I do not like the 5's taller, narrower style so I went with what I had and enjoyed. Happy camper."
"Apple",1,"Very unhappy! It clearly says its a WHITE iPhone and i got a pink one! It was crajed front and back and to top it off the camera didnt work! Ver very unhappy!"
"Apple",1,"I just found out today that the iphone I bought from planet mobile had been altered. I bought a white iphone 4 and the serial numbered registered black. needless to stay apple could not honor and replace it with a iphone 4 at a reduced price. ended up spending $500.00 to get another iphone. it is truly buyer beware and I do not plan to buy any more iphones from merchants on amazon. even though your box is sealed, which mine was, you cannot verify that it has not been altered unless you go into apple to get it repaired. not good, not good at all."
"Apple",4,":)"
"Apple",5,"Thank you ""JOYCELLS"" for delivering as promised, and the phone is in pristine condition.check her shop you will be glad you didAs for the phone itselfGreat phoneNo complaints"
"Apple",1,"Because I cannot use the product with my GSM chip,and I always understood this was possible..."
"Apple",1,"The worst purchase I ever made online. The phone was defected. I know the microphone was bad because it was very difficult for people to hear me during calls but the part that really pissed me off was the fact that I had the biggest trouble charging the phone due to the dock connector being smashed in. I guess the seller thought I wouldn't notice. How could they even sell a phone that doesn't work properly? That was the biggest inconvenience ever."
"Apple",4,"The phone has meet it expectations an more thank you very much"
"Apple",5,"Thanks Joycells. Everything works like a charm!"
"Apple",4,"Was just as I expected ecelent"
"Apple",3,"My kid is happy with it"
"Apple",5,"Got on time. No issues in activating for Verizon. Phone is in excellent condition and works great!"
"Apple",4,"in excellent condition other than normal wear and tear. my only thing is no siri"
"Apple",5,"Thank you."
"Apple",3,"Yes I Have now. All is perfect, but I made a mistake, that cellphone is CDMA and in my contry does not work, but is may fault. Any way is perfect . I am going to buy something called gmate and with that is going to workl here."
"Apple",5,"needed a phone badly since I lost mine. when I got it, it wasn't in perfect condition but it was pretty good with some minor scuffs around the edges."
"Apple",5,"Cheaper than an ipod! I love it. Bought it refurbished and it came in awesome condition. Works great!"
"Apple",5,"Gave it to my granddaughter for Christmas. Works great."
"Apple",2,"Beautiful phone! The sound didn't work though..."
"Apple",5,"Phone was in great shape just as promised in original box daughter was very happy."
"Apple",5,"I bought the phone a little apprehensive due to some of the reviews but I received a brand new iPhone 4s which i must say was in mint condition and it in fact was a Verizon wireless phone that had never been activated before... there for my purchase was exactly what I ordered and I would recommend this provider to anyone interested in there items ...I was very pleased and so was my daughter Christmas morning!!! Thank You!!!!"
"Apple",1,"I ordered mine from Amazon Warehouse as a replacement for a phone that was stolen. I paid for 1 day shipping to get it quickly. I got it late and then upon taking it to Verizon to hate it activated on my existing line I discovered that it in fact was NOT a Verizon phone. I tried initiating a return with Amazon which was rejected with a message stating I had to call customer service. How the heck am I suppose to call customer service if I don't have a phone? Needless to say, I just sent them a nasty email. Hopefully I will get a favorable response since this is their error and not mine."
"Apple",3,"The phone came with a broken exterior speaker and the ear speaker is not as loud as it should be."
"Apple",1,"I'm sure Mango is a great organization but this phone was a complete waste of my time & funds. Nothing works as it should, so not useable. Very frustrating not having a phone that works for this price!"
"Apple",3,"No SIM card slot, if I would've know would have order it.It was nice and I wanted to keep it but I have AT&T and thought I could change it with my SIM card but no slot.Still didn't want to return it, so I was going to give as a gift but they are all AT&T customers.Was very nice but had to return it."
"Apple",2,"When I got I I knew it would be used, that's why I didn't mind the small scratches on the screen. The only thing that pissed my off is that I was not told that one of the speakers wouldn't work. And then the headphones( don't know if they were new or not) just stopes working for me"
"Apple",3,"Shipped quick, great phone, only 3 starts because my microphone did not work unless its on speaker. Kinda stuck on weather to send it back and be without a phone for 2 weeks and go through reactivate or just get a blue tooth device and not even have to use it."
"Apple",5,"Received used / like new phone. It was virtually 'new', no scratches in near pristine condition. Came with small carring case and charger. EIN number was clearly labeled. Works great, no problems getting activated or charging. Seller is A+!"
"Apple",3,"When I ordered it at the end of June, I was happy. It came fast and looked new. But In mid November IT QUIT WORKING. LIKE ARE YOU KIDDING. IT WAS NEVER DROPPED AND I HAD A CASE ON IT 24/7 AND IT JUST RANDOMLY QUIT WORKING. I am so mad . I spent a huge amount of money and its already broke? Thats bull crap."
"Apple",5,"I got a great price, and it arrived on time for Christmas. It actually arrived ahead of the promised date. My daughter, who received the phone as a gift is very happy with it."
"Apple",5,"we like the price like the product it doesn't had any scratchlike the gigabites,the color and special because it was in good condition"
"Apple",2,"This phone doesn't pull as many reception bars as my black phone. It does most things except complete calls well. That's the trouble. What good is a phone that doesn't do its main job of completing phone calls well? And even though it was brand new, Apple said, ""It's from an outside vendor, and you're on your own.""Too bad."
"Apple",5,"At first I was almost sure I was going to get scammed because this was such a great deal! It works perfectly and I couldn't be more satisfied with my new iPhone 4. Love it! Thank you!"
"Apple",5,"Problem, scratch, and blemish free, just the way it should be :) why buy a new iPhone? :) :) :)"
"Apple",1,"It is great althought my home button only works half the time and so i have to hit it several times to get back to my home screen from anywhere. Not good!"
"Apple",4,"I bought the 'Used - very good' condition. There were some slight scratch marks and some 'dirt' in the speaker slots and other cavities. Other than that, I've had it for almost 2 months now and no issues so far."
"Apple",1,"I spent two hours on the phone to activate it for it to not even be a Verizon phone. Its made for AT&T. Very unhappy."
"Apple",3,"I purchased this phone for use overseas, only to learn AFTER I received it that there wasn't a GSM Chip Slot. I currently use an iPhone 4 and it does have the GSM Slot, I had no idea the newer ones or from Verizon did not.I will now have to try and sell this item and get one GSM ready.Gary"
"Apple",3,"I bought the phone it looks great no scratches nothing it was a used phone the only problem was the batterie dies in about an hour and sometimes doesn't even turn back on it takes about 30 minutes. I tried contacting amazon and they told me to check with apple but apple didn't do anything."
"Apple",5,"I bought this phone for my daughter. We didn't have any problems with it."
"Apple",5,"Good"
"Apple",1,"They listed the product as NEW and it is VERY USED."
"Apple",1,"Camera lens was vary bad could not use buttons does not work"
"Apple",4,"With any used item that you purchase you're taking a chance but with this item it's in really good shape other than the home button is non responsive at times. Overall it's a good purchase.."
"Apple",1,"It was no clear for us whose first language is not English the description of the cell. It is impossible to use it here in Brazil ans mt purychase, mt money was lost. I wrote a message for you, but there wasn't any answer. So, sadly, it was my first and my last purchase.Sibcerely yiurs,Denise Batista da Luz"
"Apple",5,"excellent"
"Apple",1,"phone is ridiculously slow"
"Apple",5,"Perfect!"
"Apple",5,"perfect"
"Apple",4,"great phone, works awesome!"
"Apple",5,"work good thanks"
"Apple",3,"It is fine"
"Apple",2,"Camera does not work"
"Apple",5,"Great deal. Looks good, works great!"
"Apple",5,"peerfect for my niece"
"Apple",5,"Best phone I have ever bought! Now looking for another one for my mom."
"Apple",3,"Not the iPhone I needed. Didn't realize AT&T phones needed a sim card."
"Apple",5,"Stopped working already had to buy a new one . Not happy at all."
"Apple",2,"Eh.. it was an old phone. Probably the first one ever made. I'm not sure about that, but I had problems with the screen zooming on its own and then sticking there. This might happen while on a call (from which I couldn't hang up because the hangup button was way off screen) or it might happen while I'm browsing the internet. I had to restart the phone to get the screen back the right size. It was very frustrating and I deactived it to go to a different, less problematic phone. I would have liked to have known about the issues this phone had ahead of time. I will probably not buy from the company that sold this again for the reason mentioned above."
"Apple",4,"it's not the ""be all and end all"" device that Apple zealots would have you believe.This has been my first apple device, and it's certainly adequate. It's not bad, but it's not light-years ahead of other devices either.It's not without bugs or quirks. Most outstanding: it has problems with DHCP with my wifi-cable modem where I need to turn wifi on the phone off and then on again in order to get traffic flowing again. This need has revealed another quirk where, on occassion, Wifi will *not* turn off. Sometimes the slider (on-off switch) bounces back to the ""on"" position. Sometimes it looks like it turns off, but when I go back to the main settings screen and then return to the wifi settings screen, the wifi switch is back on again. In this situation, I go through a cycle of turning wifi off 3 - 8 times before it actually remains off.Text entry is simply uninspired. For all Apple's much bally-hewed design talents, they certainly didn't waste any cleverness surging beyond a basic keyboard. The phone's auto-complete feature is nice, but I had better auto-completion on a Palm V over 10 years ago. I pine for T9 to accelerate text entry.Built-in email is well integrated & supports multiple accounts. Build-in calendar is less versatile.Speaker phone is adequate, but I've had better from cheaper phones.Oh, and if you only want to use wifi-sourced data on your phone & avoid data plan fees, iPhones work perfectly fine without a data plan.At the risk of stating the obvious: if you don't have a data plan, you don't get google maps, email, etc. when you're out-of-range of a wifi network. For me, this is fine. The carriers categorize text messaging as non-data, so you can pay for that if you like.Sure, without data you take a hit on certain (& very few) phone features; the most significant & least obvious, I'd say, would be the log of outstanding voicemails the iPhone can show you.-- Without data, you just get an indicator that you have voicemail to be listened to.-- With data, you get an inventory of who left you voicemails at what times.***All*** iPhone apps have settings to enable/disable data transfer over the phone network. The phone also has a ""master"" setting for this, too.DO NOT let Verizon, Sprint, etc. tell you that a data plan is necessary to operate one of these on their networks. It's simply not so, and -- unless they've changed their tunes in the past 2 years -- they will not tell you this. Verizon & Sprint (and probably all other carriers) will make you get a data plan to have one of these on their network, and they won't tell you anything different. When I've asked them, they've been unequivocal on this requirement. Their justification for this is completely bogus; namely that smart phones need data to operate.I've learned, however, of 2 ways to get around this requirement.1 - get a pay-as-you-go account2 - piggy back your iPhone on an account with someone else's iPhone that has a data plan.(in my case, my wife's work pays for her phone & plan; I piggy-back on the account, but don't use data."
"Apple",1,"Phone wouldn't work 10 minutes after I got it. I've only had it for 5 hours. When I first turned it on, it took forever and I noticed these lines going across the screen. At first it would go black if I was on it for more than 30 seconds now the screen keeps fading black everytime I try to unlock it and will randomely shut off. Seems to me like water damage because this is what happened to my last iphone I got wet. So in that case this is a scam."
"Apple",5,"this product is great so far bought it for Christmas so don't know how long it will last but the price you cant beat and always amazon is great so well pleased"
"Apple",5,"I love the Apple phone.This is a outstanding deal and phone. I don't like writing a book to tell you about this. Deal"
"Apple",5,"My granddaughter is thrilled with the phone which she will use until the family plan is qualified for renewal and then move up to the latest iPhone available at the time!"
"Apple",1,"This phone was a lemon. It looked great when it arrived, but the battery was near death, and after a few days the Home Button stopped working. The screen wouldn't react to tough, either. It was a very frustrating ordeal. I hope they don't turn around and pass it off onto someone else.It's time to through that baby away."
"Apple",5,"This was a gift for my son. He really likes the phone and keeps it close by all the time."
"Apple",5,"My daughter wanted a iPhone for Christmas! Found this one Cyber Monday for a GREAT deal with all the accessories brand new in the box. Phone works great"
"Apple",4,"Phone was delivered promptly. I was worried that phone may be used or wouldn't connect with Verizon. Phone appears to be new and I had no problems connecting with Verizon. I have issues with several apps, but I don't consider that the seller's fault. Phone won't download entire I-tunes library and the maps doesn't have a voice feature. ."
"Apple",5,"Works like an absolute charm. The seller got this too me EXTREMELY speedy and was extremely nice. Never ever had any problem with it and I've had it for almost 2 months now. Works beautifully."
"Apple",1,"The charger didn't work"
"Apple",2,"Has decent functions but very slow phone. And there is no option to make it to where when on phone calls the screen closes or locks so your face make you push buttons constantly or you conference in other calls. That's a major disappointment always have to use speaker I you don't want that to happen."
"Apple",3,"When I opened it, it had a large crack near the camera."
"Apple",3,"I wouldn't buy a Iphone 4 after having the 5C. The navigation is impossible."
"Apple",2,"it worked well for 2 weeks but now the screen ""spasms"" all the time. I cant take photos and often cant select an icon while this is going on."
"Apple",1,"My phone don't even work half the time"
"Apple",1,"This phone is unable to use in other countries, don't buy it if you need to use outside USA !!!!! I bought it unloocked but it didn't works."
"Apple",5,"Loved that phone wish I still had it"
"Apple",5,"I got my phone a week earlier than expected & it works perfectly :)"
"Apple",5,"Very fast shipping-great product- works great:)"
"Apple",5,"LOVE THEM LOVE IT WILL S=USE AGAIN. HAVE TO GO ON AND ON ALL IS GREAT I LOVE AMAZON REALLY HATE HAVING TO REVIEW EVERYTHING BUT THESE PEOPLE WERE GREAT"
"Apple",5,"Came in a timely manner with a little slip with contact info (if there was any reason we were unsatisfied) That was very appreciated but unnecessary because I have had no problems. I would definitely order from this company again. Greatness."
"Apple",1,"good afternoon this is to notify my dissatisfaction with the iphone 4 to buy, I tell him that is CDMA technology and that technology does not work in my country Venezuela today there is technology GCM sim car (ie with Chip) when I buy your produto of features not described in that technology, we show that I can not use the iphone in my country if it could be actual return him mind I feel cheated"
"Apple",1,"The phone behind is rift,and the Product Description:USB cable and a wall charger, all the original booklets and a box, I just see the USB cable,not the wall charger and others."
"Apple",1,"Was the wrong kind of cell and now that I am much more knowledgable on product a suggestion when sellers are giving details to please include if this is a GSM or CDMA cell.. Where this phone was being sent there was no service at all available for use.."
"Apple",5,"""i'm a hipster and now that this phone is an old outdated version of the iphone, it's become even more hip!"" - Wusten"
"Apple",3,"The iPhone's home button was not working which makes the whole phone not worth 214$ i would not recommend this to a friend"
"Apple",3,"My husband complains that when headphones are in it only works on very high volume. He has tried several different sets of headphones and it's the same thing."
"Apple",5,"I was so sick of being picked on for having only a 16 gb iphone 4. People would call me names like ""oh hey, there's the poo poo face"" as if i were the quiet kid in kindergarten cop. One guy threw rocks at me and one guy shouted ""hey that guy gave my sister herpes!"". Since i got the 32 gb version the newly found lack of negativity is slightly less!"
"Apple",5,"I got a great price, and it arrived on time for Christmas. It actually arrived ahead of the promised date. My daughter, who received the phone as a gift is very happy with it."
"Apple",5,"If I could give this product a million stars, I would. I absolutely love this phone! Not a scratch on it, and so far there are no troubles with anything. Easy to activate, and has an amazing music player. I love my iPhone so much! And for an iPhone, it's pretty cheap! THANK YOU! Buy from this seller! You will NOT regret it!"
"Apple",5,"Everything as described. Will buy from again."
"Apple",5,"Item came just as expected, and was well packed. I had to return mine, though, because the friend I got it for got a new phone the day after it arrived."
"Apple",1,"I bought this phone to replace my old one through verizon, however I know that phones have a tendency to break so I bought a warranty as well. I can't get my money back for either and now I am out a phone and $190. Don't waste your money because mine broke, the power button and home button has a lot of issues. I won't be buying anything else through Amazon anymore because of how everything was taken care of."
"Apple",1,"battery dead top power off button not working sent back"
"Apple",4,"It works great but would like a bigger screen."
"Apple",5,"Luv it!!!"
"Apple",5,"This I phone is wonderful, I realize it is an older model, but for our first smart phone it works great!"
"Apple",5,"It did exactly what I needed it to do."
"Apple",1,"It arrived and the microphone didn't work. Do NOT buy from these people."
"Apple",5,"Worked very well, no scratches. Only one side of the speakers worked but for the price it was great. It was glitchy here & there but it only happened every so often that it wasn't really a problem. Restarted the phone & it was fine. Overall great product & great price. Would recommend."
"Apple",4,"Good phone"
"Apple",1,"When I revived it, it was fine. Or so I thought. The power button was stuck and was hard to operate. Now it's completely broken."
"Apple",5,"I wanted a iphone n i got it came 2 days before"
"Apple",5,"Excellent and prompt!"
"Apple",5,"Just as described!!! Brand new! Love It!"
"Apple",5,"Great so far. no issues. product had no scratches!"
"Apple",5,"Excellent"
"Apple",5,"Loved the phone."
"Apple",1,"This was actually not a certified Apple product. After going to the MAC store and being told it was not a genuine product and that many things were altered on it! Amazon sent us a refund. Amazon handled this professionally and am grateful that it was a smooth return."
"Apple",5,"I bought this phone for my daughter. We didn't have any problems with it."
"Apple",5,"What I wanted . Fine phone."
"Apple",2,"Can't upgrade software to support Twitter......freakin' TWITTER won't run on this thing! Also bluetooth would randomly switch off, phone needed to be rebooted to get it back on. Last straw was it would not respond when I tried to access my voicemail. I'm giving it two stars because even with a cracked screen (lost my temper during the voicemail incident) its 32gb makes it a formidable music player."
"Apple",1,"Home key doesn't work properly I contacted seller no resolution"
"Apple",5,"This was the best iPhone Apple ever had til the IPhone 6S Plus came out. I had my iPhone 4 for many years and never had a problem with it...easy to learn iOS, clear calling, hundreds of thousand apps to try in the App Store...If this is your first iPhone purchase and don't want anything big then this the best phone."
"Apple",5,"nice works good"
"Apple",3,"It served the purpose till upgrade on Verizon kicked in!"
"Apple",5,"If you love Apple, you'll love this affordable phone!"
"Apple",4,"Works good! Thanks"
"Apple",3,"Had to return because I needed the iPhone 4s to run certain apps for business."
"Apple",5,"💜"
"Apple",4,"Pretty decent phone, had more scratches than expected but hey it works. Battery dies fast, but overall, I was happy with it."
"Apple",4,"I had originally owned a Droid X2, and I got it off a Groupon. Well that should have been my first red flag because the phone was only $25 (including a case, screen protector, and bluetooth). Out of frustration, I purchased the iPhone 4 in hopes that it would be a dramatic improvement compared to my Droid X2. I purchased it used, in very good condition. Aside from a minor scratch on the screen, the phone was in very good condition. The only problem I have is the home button. It either sticks, or it doesn't work immediately. But other than that, the phone itself is awesome and unless another Droid comes my way that can take the cake, I'm sticking to the iPhone."
"Apple",1,"did my best to get in touch with you for a change of equipment, since I received the phone is cdma tegnologia, and does not work in Venezuela, my intention was to file a change for gsm team, but I found it impossible to get any type of response, should pay attention to the requirements of its customers."
"Apple",5,"Phones... People have strong feelings about their cell phones it seems but when it comes down to usability, simplicity and just 'working' pretty much all of the time, still no one does it better than Apple and the iPhone.I know you can customize the Droids more here and there, I know there's no widgets, no this and no that. But there's also more security, more safety, more updates that roll out to everyone as soon as they're ready, more people using an iPhone 4 who still get to use pretty much the same features as the iPhone 5 because the software is available for both phones at the same time.The app selection is better, the best apps come out for iPhone first and the screen is great now that they've put the whole 'Retina Display' thing out there, the only real negative is the screen size, which in today's world, should really be bigger than 3.5"". Unless you have a very specific need for an Android, most users will find the iPhone just perfect for what they want to do."
"Apple",5,"I like love my new Iphone, had an issue activating it at first cause the Verizob lady told me it was through US Cellular but I got it all taken care of."
"Apple",5,"excellent product arrived on time and very good quality 100% recommended . . . . . . . . ."
"Apple",5,"I bought the phone and ship to Singapore.But I found that the phone cannot be used outside of US.I should take responsibility for the mistake.But the seller almost refund me all the payment.And save me a lot of lost.Thanks very much."
"Apple",4,"The charger didn't even fit into the iPhone has to be something wrong with this picture... And the headphone was not great too.. It was an iPhone 1 headphone while I got the iPhone 4. The iPhone was in great condition and liked it very much."
"Apple",5,"I ordered this IPhone because it came with a 30 day manufacturer warranty. Needless to say I haven't had to worry about using it. The condition said good-used and it was good the only part that wasn't the best was a little rubbing on the putter metal part from being in an otter box it's entire life. I'm very happy with my 1st iPhone I am happily converted from being an android lover! 😃"
"Apple",5,"The phone arrived in two days and is altogether just a wonderful purchase!!!!! I would recommend this phone for any and everyone!!! I love my phone!!!!!"
"Apple",5,"Was brand new in all the apple packaging complete with headphones and a charger. Was exactly as described by the seller. Extremely happy with this purchase. Great price especially now that apple has stopped producing 32 GB iPhone 4 and most cell services don't sell them."
"Apple",4,"Great!"
"Apple",2,"the phone was said to be fully functional, I quote ""The device is tested & 100% fully functional"". but the camera does not work and that is one of the main reasons I bought this phone. the seller should've mentioned that the camera is bogus. Very disappointed!!!!"
"Apple",5,"The iPhone was new and in the box as described. I received it quickly and in good condition. Well satisified."
"Apple",2,"home button does not work!"
"Apple",1,"That suck this company sale phone with somebody all account I'm un happy.and good luck to new costumer."
"Apple",5,"When I order the phone I had mixed reaction when I look at the reviews but when I gotten the iPhone all those fears were put to rest cause it works great"
"Apple",3,"i normally get great products from warehouse deals but some reason this time i got the phone and when i stuck the headsets in the phone couldnt hear a thing. got new headsets and it still didnt work"
"Apple",5,"Item as described and exactly what I wanted. Shipping was very quick."
"Apple",1,"Phone was locked. Verizon suggested it was a stolen phone."
"Apple",5,"got this for my son he loves it great prize great phone"
"Apple",1,"Constantly froze up. Very slow."
"Apple",1,"On amazon the say that the phone is 32GB and the bring me an iphone 16Gb and the back camera is not good and its not a gsm phone. I work hard to have money..."
"Apple",4,"Sometimes glitches but other than that, arrived on time & works well"
"Apple",1,"This phone is water damage"
"Apple",5,"Really great! Haven't had an issue with it. Exactly as described. Extremely fast shipping. Got it the fat after I ordered it! :)"
"Apple",5,"Happy with this purchase:-)Speedy shipping."
"Apple",5,"Excelent!!!"
"Apple",3,"when i text it doesn't have any smilie faces that i'm able to send or some other things that i don't know how to used"
"Apple",4,"Great phone . I would give 5 stars but they sent us a AT&T phone first.once we got our Verizon phone everything went great . No problems at all."
"Apple",4,"I purchased this phone after having my iPhone 5S in gold stolen, and it may as well be the same phone (minus the fingerprint accesory). It was used, and you could tell but there was nothing seriously wrong with it. It came with all the accessories like the charger, headphones, etc. It definitely works well and was a huge life saver! Great buy."
"Apple",1,"I got the phone in a timely fashion. Looked great, all accessories were included. Power button got stuck, couldn't power off. Had to send back."
"Apple",5,"This is a grest sight.The prouduct comes fast and is in good shape.A great sight.And I love the low prices!!!!!This is a great sight and I reccomend it to everyone."
"Apple",4,"I bought this phone as a little ""trial period"" for myself, to see if I wanted to get an iPhone when my contract is up (not until july of 2015 unfortunatly). I love how the apple works. I'm very impressed, even with this only being an iPhone 4, and only being supported by 3G, this little guy moves pretty fast! (Much faster than I expected). I am going to be using this phone for the next few months or until I find a reason to not like it anymore. Absolutely satisfied, and am convinced to get the iPhone 5 when I'm eligible! (Pshh, whether my contract is up or not!) Glad I decided to try this phone out, and I feel safe knowing that all the kinks are worked out of it (since I got a refurbished one). So far so good! (:"
"Apple",3,"Great phone, fast and timely shipping. the only downside to this product was that when i got it, the lock button stuck so i have to press really hard to get it to lock and unlock."
"Apple",5,"this iphone is like having a hand held computer, it is my kindle, my ipod, my ipad, my TV, my camera, my facebook, my everything my notebook-PC has. I can't say enough good about my iphone I will never have a different brand it is forever iphones for me!"
"Apple",1,"I had purchased an iphone 4 which was advertised as a Verizon phone. It was an AT & T phone and i had to return it"
"Apple",5,"Works as described. No problems and the item item matched the photos on website. I am very pleased with this item."
"Apple",4,"it is in good working order. usb charger but no wall unit to plug into. good buy anyway. satisfied customer."
"Apple",4,"it's not the ""be all and end all"" device that Apple zealots would have you believe.This has been my first apple device, and it's certainly adequate. It's not bad, but it's not light-years ahead of other devices either.It's not without bugs or quirks. Most outstanding: it has problems with DHCP with my wifi-cable modem where I need to turn wifi on the phone off and then on again in order to get traffic flowing again. This need has revealed another quirk where, on occassion, Wifi will *not* turn off. Sometimes the slider (on-off switch) bounces back to the ""on"" position. Sometimes it looks like it turns off, but when I go back to the main settings screen and then return to the wifi settings screen, the wifi switch is back on again. In this situation, I go through a cycle of turning wifi off 3 - 8 times before it actually remains off.Text entry is simply uninspired. For all Apple's much bally-hewed design talents, they certainly didn't waste any cleverness surging beyond a basic keyboard. The phone's auto-complete feature is nice, but I had better auto-completion on a Palm V over 10 years ago. I pine for T9 to accelerate text entry.Built-in email is well integrated & supports multiple accounts. Build-in calendar is less versatile.Speaker phone is adequate, but I've had better from cheaper phones.Oh, and if you only want to use wifi-sourced data on your phone & avoid data plan fees, iPhones work perfectly fine without a data plan.At the risk of stating the obvious: if you don't have a data plan, you don't get google maps, email, etc. when you're out-of-range of a wifi network. For me, this is fine. The carriers categorize text messaging as non-data, so you can pay for that if you like.Sure, without data you take a hit on certain (& very few) phone features; the most significant & least obvious, I'd say, would be the log of outstanding voicemails the iPhone can show you.-- Without data, you just get an indicator that you have voicemail to be listened to.-- With data, you get an inventory of who left you voicemails at what times.***All*** iPhone apps have settings to enable/disable data transfer over the phone network. The phone also has a ""master"" setting for this, too.DO NOT let Verizon, Sprint, etc. tell you that a data plan is necessary to operate one of these on their networks. It's simply not so, and -- unless they've changed their tunes in the past 2 years -- they will not tell you this. Verizon & Sprint (and probably all other carriers) will make you get a data plan to have one of these on their network, and they won't tell you anything different. When I've asked them, they've been unequivocal on this requirement. Their justification for this is completely bogus; namely that smart phones need data to operate.I've learned, however, of 2 ways to get around this requirement.1 - get a pay-as-you-go account2 - piggy back your iPhone on an account with someone else's iPhone that has a data plan.(in my case, my wife's work pays for her phone & plan; I piggy-back on the account, but don't use data."
"Apple",1,"Screen didn't work"
"Apple",4,"Excellent service and product."
"Apple",5,"great condition and good camera"
"Apple",4,"Nice"
"Apple",5,"It was just what I wanted and was actually cheaper than they said it would be. It was a couple of days later than I thought it would be."
"Apple",1,"This ""Apple iPhone 4 32GB"" turned out to be what appeared to be an iPhone 4 brain in a case designed like the 4S but lacking the Apple logo. It had no model number; the back case was blank. Both times I plugged it into my computer, it crashed iTunes, and iCloud said the device was unrecognizable.Total garbage. Fortunately, they refunded my money very quickly when I sent the phone back."
"Apple",5,"best present my daughter received on Christmas day. Great vendor"
"Apple",5,"Ordered this for my Dad several months ago and he is very happy with the phone. It looked brand new, activated right away, and we have had no problems with it. Thanks Joycells.. Good value!"
"Apple",3,"Has some home button issues that will not be taken care of by Apple...that's a fallacy on refurbished phones. However, it works great, looks great, and does what it is supposed."
"Apple",2,"My aunt does not like it. Only the first owner of the phone can unlock it. In addition, it comes with a MEID number instead of IMEID which needs to be verified before using the phone. My aunt informs me that she is thinking of returning the phone."
"Apple",1,"When I bought this a while ago, I was buying a 32GB phone. Then when I got the phone, the phone was reported stolen. The seller immediately responded to my claim and he sent me a new phone. Except the new one was only a 16 GB phone and it was hard to hear people when I was on a call. I also paid the amount for a 32 GB phone and ended up with a 16 GB phone that came with a bonus ""box."" Then the hearing part went completely out, so I just bought a new phone from Verizon."
"Apple",5,"OK. Good purchase!!"
"Apple",3,"I received the cell phone really quickly and ive been using it since... its a little sluggish at times but its managable but the one thing that pissed me off about it is that the sound only comes out of one of the speakers and at one time, the sound wasn't even working. literally have to slam the phone on the back then the sound came back on....."
"Apple",4,"bluetooth doesnt workits a tad glitchy now and thencharging is a tad spotty and slow at timesit can get really laggybut i can live with all these things"
"Apple",5,"great for music"
"Apple",4,"It was sad the only reason I bough it was to stream my disney movies at that time you could only do it with an IPhone"
"Apple",5,"Great"
"Apple",5,"Great value"
"Apple",1,"Not unlocked"
"Apple",5,"I wouldn't have purchased this phone. It was used and had negative reviews. BUT I bought it for my grandson with HIS money and thought at the time that I would be teaching him a lesson. Instead HE taught me a lesson. The phone looked new. It does everything it's supposed to do. He LOVES it!! What more can you ask? It arrived quickly and the transaction was effortless. He always wanted an IPhone and after going through many other brands of less quality finally decided to get one he could afford. 5 stars for delivering as promised in a condition better than promised and for making my grandson very happy!"
"Apple",1,"I am not satisfied with the product. The phone constantly freezes up and will not function at all for several minutes and this gets VERY ANNOYING. Sometimes when I talk on my phone people tell me they cannot hear me and it sounds like I am talking through a tunnel. I have not contacted the company to request a refund or exchange because I have been super busy."
"Apple",3,"great phone as advertised shipping is great will recommend"
"Apple",1,"The screen went black after 2weeks of use. I have tried everything and it want come on. This is the second phone i have purchased off of here and they never work over 2weeks."
"Apple",5,"32 GB really made the difference for me - more music, more apps and it was in perfect condition. Thanks Folks"
"Apple",4,"Just like new for a fraction of the price. My daughter loves it, she uses it all day and night. I would recomend an otter box case they pay for them selves in no time."
"Apple",1,"So far no problems as of yet did find local store n in Columbus ohio where I could buy brand new for 150.00 wish I knew before hand to save the extra money will look around next time"
"Apple",5,"I was about to buy this phone same phone for about 70 bucks more for new out of the box. Saw the same phone in the warehouse section with the Amazon guarantee. So glad i got the warehouse deal. Phone came with a charger like new, no i phone box but who cares."
"Apple",1,"I ordered an iPhone 4 32GB and they sent an 8GB iPhone, was not what i ordered. Let for a trip and had to have someone else send a phone to my address in Florida while trying to work. Total disaster."
"Apple",5,"for the great price it worked and there was no damage when I received it but I already lost it never fails when I buy a apple product."
"Apple",4,"Very good phone my son likes it. It wasn't scratch and was nicely kept. Was very easy to set up on pre paid service."
"Apple",1,"failed to work past 2 months"
"Apple",3,"Phone freezes up at times otherwise served its purpose."
"Apple",5,"Great, Exacty as promised. Thank you very much,"
"Apple",5,"So far, so good!"
"Apple",1,"Refurbished is bad, had serious and predictable interruptions to the music."
"Apple",5,"bien"
"Apple",1,"Phone was defective and had to be turned on speakerphone to talk at all. sent back to seller."
"Apple",5,"Very nice phone has great view works amazing when I received it was already upgraded real nice phone"
"Apple",3,"3 stars because it's use, but that what I expected"
"Apple",4,"Great but slow"
"Apple",1,"I ordered two of these phones. On both of them the home buttons do not work correctly, you have to push them multiple times to get them to work, and sometimes you can't get them to work at all. These were a complete waste of money. I would definitely stay away from these!"
"Apple",5,"Very nice phone. My wife loves it."
"Apple",4,"It has been a great phone. Can't complain at all. I felt it was a good price also. Came with all the newer updates."
"Apple",5,"Great phone sold it and upgraded to the 5s. Excellent product as described."
"Apple",5,"Great sale... No problem was sent and delivered as promised..."
"Apple",1,"Made in China. Glitchy. Updated Sept 2016: phone wouldn't hold a charge then refused to turn on altogether. Glass is not iPhone glass. I have owned a couple.iphones and this one didn't seem like a legit one. It wasn't worth the $ at all."
"Apple",5,"Works perfect!"
"Apple",1,"I am very upset about these cell phones. They are very problematic. I bought the cell phones because my husbands phone was broken and he needed a new one. I was told in the add these were NEW phones, so I bought one for myself also because it had 32GB and I have a 8GB. Since I have had my old phone I had no problems so I'm thinking I'll get another iphone S since old one worked so well. However, my husband has had nothing but problems with the phone since I bought the cell phone for him. We have been to the Apple store three times. My husband has had music coming out of the phone for no reason. He did not have any music on at the time. The cell phone freezing up and not responding to touch. The other one I bought for myself will not allow me to type Text messages with certain letters (like the T and g do not work). I cannot open the phone I have to swipe it many many times before it will open if at all. I'm so frustrated with this phone."
"Apple",1,"The phone I bought completely went black and does not work at all. I took it to Apple and they said it was non repairable! I havent had the phone a full 30 days!"
"Apple",1,"I've barely owned this two months and it already fails me. The sound/speakers work fine with everything EXCEPT when it comes to notifying me of incoming calls/texts/etc. Oh sure, the alarm works when I need to get up in the morning for work, and for playing podcasts, videos, and music. But what's the point of a phone when a call or text comes in and I have NO idea? Horribly inconvenient. I didn't buy this phone for fun, I need it to COMMUNICATE. This is my first Apple device and truly the biggest regret I've ever purchased. If only my financial situation allowed me to make this right - to buy a new/better phone - but, dang. I'm screwed over and there's not much I can do about it. Thanks Apple."
"Apple",5,"I'm extremely satisfied with this purchase . It came in the box brand new and perfect! I bought another one for a friend."
"Apple",5,"This used iphone 4 was in ridiculously great condition. The price was similar or better than other used or refurbished iphones with less GB storage. My teenage son was getting this as a replacement phone until our contract is up for renewal and he can get a new one. Now he's not sure he wants a new one."
"Apple",1,"Wasn't able to activate it the phone is still under someone else contract so it was useless . Had to return . Still waiting on my refund. Please make sure esn is clean before u sell another"
"Apple",5,"Wonderful phone altogether for a wonderful price....Very very satisfied.....Purchased w. a SquareTrade 1-Year Accident Protection Plan for Prepaid Cell Phone just to make sure everything was covered....As of yet have not had to use it *fingerscrossed :-D Again, a very wonderful device! Came quickly and had no signs of flaws or wear and tear (the phone literally looked brand new!) Just keep in mind if buying this device; it is a VERIZON iPhone which means IT COMES WITH NO SIM CARDS SLOT, it will have to be activated by an associate of iOTA (internet over the air)......Again, a perfect device! Would most definately do business with the seller again! Keep up the great work!"
"Apple",5,"It took me a long time to get on board with the updating to a smart phone, and I really don't know what I was thinking. Some advice though: make sure you are buying a genuine apple phone and GET INSURANCE! I bought the 32 gb iPhone, and two weeks later dropped it in water. When I took it to an apple store, they said it had been hampered with and thus they couldn't replace it unless I wanted to pay $750.So then I had to buy another one (obviously I couldn't go back to not having words with friends)...I bought from an apple dealer and paid a little extra for the warranty. And don't forget the case, because you will drop this everyday."
"Apple",4,"Worked great thanks for the new phone has made a big difference with the available space and came in well before the last day for the arrival"
"Apple",1,"This is definitely not a new phone as the original posting had stated. Sure, the phone looked new when I got it, but it only lasted me about 4 months before the battery started draining and dying at 40%. Not to mention the super lag that came with it. Do not buy this! What a scam."
"Apple",4,"iphone is in good shape - works great - except the on/0ff button on top - this phone is so much easier to operate than my old smart phone."
"Apple",2,"No voice text which I thought all Iphone 4 had :-( obviously my fault for not doing the research and making sure it had the features I wanted..."
"Apple",2,"IT IS A CDMA PHONE THAT DOES WORK HERE IN THE BAHAMAS, I AM SO PISSED AT THIS PURCHASE! NEVER AGAIN WILL I DO THIS EVER! SO THE PHONEIS WORTHLESS HERE!"
"Apple",1,"I thought I was buying what was listed. But I received a different GB of phone than I had paid for. She did pay me the difference of the item I got and what I had originally paid for. But I am still upset because that's not what I wanted, and the phone wasn't unlocked."
"Apple",5,"I was scared i would have gotten an iphone that was cracked with scratches or something, but when it arrived it looked brand new like no one has ever used it. I was very impressed!(: i love the phone, so glad i ordered it, everything came with it. it was a great price too! (:"
"Apple",3,"Add more description to the phone because when i had received mine the home button had some problems and did not want to work sometimes. also with the phone speakers, i am a person of music i like to always listen to music but when the speakers do not work fully it disappointed me. overall the phone was a great buy and i really enjoy it"
"Apple",1,"The phone looked in great shape when I received it...however at first I noticed it was a bit slower than my previous iPhones. After a couple weeks it was very evident the phone was not processing well. Here we are 2 months later and besides using it as a phone, everything else is so slow that I cant browse or check email unless I have 15 minutes to wait and reopen the application multiple times. I am very disappointed in this product"
"Apple",5,"I can't complain about he phone at all I love it a lot. I would let everyone know about it"
"Apple",5,"Very pleased with my purchase, all new and works great. I will use the net for all my shopping from now on."
"Apple",3,"Everything is fine except the home button only works half the time. But the price was pretty low and it's otherwise fully functional."
"Apple",4,"I'm in Guangzhou, China received Iphone4 32GB, overall is very good. Is the screen and border wear more often, it was a very good deal. Using Chinese telecommunications services."
"Apple",1,"The only big problem of this iphone is that i can't used because the phone is locked.SO NOW WHAT? -.-"
"Apple",5,"Thank you the phone looks like it is brand new and works great! Couldnt be more happy with the product. highly recommended!"
"Apple",4,"Met my expectations"
"Apple",5,"First I want to say that I purchased this new, through Amazon. The phone was as described, new and with all the accessories. Had no trouble activating it with Verizon and I am very happy with the purchase. It is a good basic i phone at a fair price!"
"Apple",5,"Awesome"
"Apple",4,"Good experience"
"Apple",5,"this iphone was okay but I found out before sending the product back that it doesn't have siri or even facetime. I sent it back right away without opening the box."
"Apple",5,"my son loves his phone. No issues as of yet"
"Apple",5,"So far so good !"
"Apple",5,"It was so clean"
"Apple",5,"Was on time and very satisfied"
"Apple",4,"Pros the price was right. Con can't up date the operating system."
"Apple",5,"very satisfied thank you"
"Apple",3,"I had an iPhone 4, that I only replaced because I switched from AT&T to Verizon. This phone was great when it arrived, but about 6 months later, I now don't have reliable sound unless I have headphones plugged in or it is on a dock. My alarms still go off, and sometimes it rings, so it's not the speakers or anything, just a software issue I guess. I new I was taking a risk when buying a used phone from Amazon, so I can't be horribly upset, but I'm now thinking hard about whether I'll ever do that again."
"Apple",5,"good"
"Apple",5,"Thanks for the phone."
"Apple",5,"This stuff was great I love amazon"
"Apple",5,"Great phone and awesome seller!!!! VERY FAST SHIPPING!! Highly recommend!!! Thanks!!"
"Apple",4,"My sister loves it except the volume button does not work and one of the speakers are blown out.... Crap for the money you pay."
"Apple",1,"Product arrived quickly, looked great, but the headset input didn't work so I returned it."
"Apple",1,"phone speaker not working, and bottom button intermittant."
"Apple",5,"As described"
"Apple",4,"Very good....no scratches at all. I love it but the only problem I am facing is a message popping up and say your phone can not be activated however I see the Verizon network. That's funny."
"Apple",5,"I got my iphone earlier. It was as they had described it. I'm very happy with my iphone and the conditions were great.. Thank you!! :)"
"Apple",3,"Phone works really well. I had to take to Verizon store to have activated. However I was expecting a 32gb and only received a16gb so that was disappointing."
"Apple",2,"Apple was 1st in the race with these types of products, and they were great for the first few years, but history has now repeated itself with the Apple Corporation in that they have again fallen asleep with customer needs, no incorporation of new technology, products stale, prices OUTRAGEOUS on ALL their products, and so many other reasons.We have ditched all our apple products and switched to Android products from one company (which I will not name here). In the last 47 years of my life I have never bought an Apple Personal Computer and I have only bought 3 apple devices which we have sold them all. You would think CEOs would have to take a basic freshman 101 course in lessons learned from history, but apparently its beyond their grasp. It has always been amazing to me what their salaries are!"
"Apple",4,"I was not comfortable buying this off line, but it seems to be working great so far. Only time will tell...."
"Apple",4,"Great deal on this phone. I took a big chance and had a lot of doubt. The phone arrived on excellent condition and for the price this was a great deal. Thank you'"
"Apple",4,"Indeed it is a very fabulous phone with details that I have to learn for months.I really like it. Shadrack"
"Apple",1,"The Phone does not work it's crap! It slowly got worse now I'm to the point where I cannot hear my calls!"
"Apple",3,"the phone is new like the description, but the front camera issue and can't use properly.thanks to Amazon and 360 mobile solutions for this withdraw."
"Apple",4,"there were no marks on it and it works perfect. i havnt had any problems with it so far. just like new."
"Apple",5,"ok got the phone in 3 day after ordering. i went with the shipping set up amazon pre assigned. did not pay anything extra. brand new in box sealed. it is just as advertised. t has an update available to iOS 7 upon set up if you go to settings then general and tell it look for update. it comes with iOS 6 . yes FaceTime is available. i would recommend alpha cell via amazon. i am a happy camper. have not set up with verizon yet wanted make sure it worked first. worst case its an iPod.http://www.verizonwireless.com/support/how-to-activate-apple-iphone-4/including activation set up from Verizon. not easy to find. must do this before attempting to make Verizon account. make sure everything you do is on the prepaid account side. last note here the 30 day prepaid account is unlimited talk text and web. the 30 dollar card gets you the whole month. I paid with 2 15 dollar cards to make the 30."
"Apple",1,"Horrible don't buy. Glitches"
"Apple",5,"The phone looks great and exceeds expectations. It has a heft that makes me realize it's a phone and no longer am iPod!"
"Apple",5,"Great"
"Apple",5,"Still working until now, excellent"
"Apple",5,"Excellant"
"Apple",2,"The phone I bought would only hold a charge for 6 hours, very disappointed."
"Apple",1,"No one can hear you talk on it. Can only talk with the speaker phone or via Wifi with another device.Totally bummed. Returning it as soon as I find another phone!Thought the ""deal"" was too good. And it came wrapped in a Iphone 4 box and all, and it sure looked New!Too bad it does not work. I can't walk around using the speaker phone, and I am not using an ear piece.Perfect if you dont actually want to talk on it!"
"Apple",5,"Amazing"
"Apple",2,"Item looks good, no scratches or blemishes. But turns off and then on randomly for no reason. Doesn't seem like something a ""new"" phone should do."
"Apple",2,"No I thought it had a sim card slot..."
"Apple",5,"Excellent brand new in package"
"Apple",5,"Shipping was supper fast and I love it"
"Apple",1,"Battery was dead within a month."
"Apple",5,"It's great!"
"Apple",5,"Was actually a 4S. Nice! Perfect condition"
"Apple",3,"I thought I was the responsible one and didn't pay for the insurance for my phone. Of course I was the one who dropped their phone in the rain and it cracked all over the place. Anyway, I found one on Amazon that was about the price as if I had paid the monthly insurance premium all this time. The home button sticks sometimes but my stepdaughter put a menu icon on the front so I can quickly get the home screen. Kids know all kinds of neat stuff."
"Apple",4,"Arrived early. Exactly as described. One tiny bubble on the edge of the screen, but nothing I would complain about. Overall It's a good phone and new."
"Apple",4,"The phone it's self didn't run as fast as I wanted it to but it is keeping up nicley with my old phone."
"Apple",4,"great phone, works awesome!"
"Apple",5,"its perfect i have no prolbems everyone should buy products off amazon they never let me down and always have the best of everything"
"Apple",4,"The only reason I did not give five stars is because I found out that only the right speaker works, I mostly use it with headphones though or a ihome. It holds a bunch of songs but since I plugged it into my computer itunes flipped out and said it has to be uninstalled but i put a lock so that no one can delete itunes, i cant get into it to unlock the lock so i can only have the songs i have baught on my iphone, not ones that i have on cds. I wish i had the money to use the phone part of it but for now i have my music"
"Apple",5,"great item as they said it was would use them again for any purchase. i cant say enough good things thanks"
"Apple",5,"It works perfectly and I absolutely love it. Best phone I have ever had, even when I was dead set on droid!"
"Apple",5,"32 gigs is an awful lot for a guy who only sends about twenty or so emails a month and receives back less. Phone works great, but my wife's 8 gig one is just enough"
"Apple",5,"I was very impressed with the service and quality of the product I received. The product was shipped immediately and I received it before the expected date. The phone was in perfect (new) condition and I have had no problems with it at all. Activating it was a breeze. I would suggest this seller to anybody!"
"Apple",5,"The phone is awesome and much better than a droid or HTC. I will never go back to a windows based product."
"Apple",1,"I purchased and iPhone 4 32gb from 360Mobile Solutions received the Phone May 2, 2013 and the phone's speaker and microphone did not work and I excused it at first because I needed a phone but on May 20, 2013 the phone went black and completely stopped working. smh. I don't like the fact that 360 did not have away from me to contact them to get their help in solving this problem. I personally thank Amazon for stepping up and helping me out with a total refund. I write this in hope's the 360 Mobile Solutions step their game up to because that was UNACCEPTABLE!"
"Apple",5,"I really have enjoyed my iPhone. The phone came as it was described on picture. I have no complaints and price was great."
"Apple",5,"my brother tell me to buy a Iphone i don't to buy it because i don't how to used it. My first time to buy a Iphone and i love to used it, it's awesome. if i have more money i buy the black one too."
"Apple",5,"I was able to load all of my music onto this phone."
"Apple",5,"VERY happy with my purchase!!! It was a Christmas gift for my husband and he adores it. Uses it every minute of the day! Thanks for a great product and super speedy delivery!"
"Apple",1,"Very disappointed with purchase I'm having problems sending mail with the iPhone and now my iPad as well. The aol.com email doesn't send my email but I'm receiving my email to my email account! When I try to send a message it says that the password or the username is incorrect! Please help? Thank you!"
"Apple",4,"I like it, the big memory is good for the music I like!"
"Apple",1,"Worked for 7 days and then wouldn't charge or even come back on."
"Apple",5,"Great price, 69.99. arrived quickly and works perfectly. Appears to be brand new."
"Apple",5,"Awesome produce, awesome price. Thank you so much"
"Apple",5,"My kids love these phones! They have used them for over 6 months without any problems."
"Apple",1,"This phone has no SIMM slot - pretty much worthless if you want to use with any carrier."
"Apple",5,"As advertised"
"Apple",4,"I've had this iphone for over a month and its easy to use and fun. The earpiece did stop working for awhile but it seems to be working now."
"Apple",5,"After Verizon changed its upgrade cycle that coincided with both of my phone upgrades, I was left to either replace my son's non-functioning phone by purchasing an iPhone 5 for over $600, wait for next year to upgrade/replace or pay $200 to repair my son's originally free phone. I opted to check out what was being offered for last year's iPhone on Amazon and found a reasonably priced slightly used iPhone 4 with a great deal of memory. The device works as expected, no blemishes (at least none that I could find and I think there was mention of typical minor wear and tear - I saw none but I think that has to be put out there for used/refurb devices) and all cords, chargers were included in packaging. It was delivered early and my son is thoroughly pleased to go from a free Samsung smartphone to an iPhone 4 (granted he wanted the 5 but he's 15 - he'll live...besides he's happy to be at the same level his friends are at with their phones). I will be purchasing my phone this way and going outside of Verizon's market from now on. This seller is outstanding, the service and quality easily exceeds expectations. Thoroughly pleased!!!!"
"Apple",5,"I wanted an iPhone that was current but inexpensive. I found it on amazon. Good price, good product. I am very pleased."
"Apple",4,"Its an iPhone 4. Nothing too special about it. I got mine fairly fast for where I live (the middle of a cornfield). Ordered a Verizon phone and got a Verizon phone. There were a few small scratches on the back of the phone but I put a case on right away. The only thing wrong is there is a small spot on the screen that is more whited out than the rest of the screen. Not big and not a big issue. Ive been using it for a few months now. I have finally activated the phone and had no issues. Only reason for 4 stars is the whiter spot on the screen. Great seller."
"Apple",2,"I got it earlier than expected with everything. But,it came compleatly scratched up. But it still works. Can hardly see the screen."
"Apple",5,"Great this seller doesn't lie everything was just as he said it would be!Everything works great and the iPhone has changed what I thought of my Droid"
"Apple",5,"I purchased this phone for my husband and he is very satisfied with the performance and the capabilities. One of his favorite gifts ever."
"Apple",4,"Small crack on body of device, not internal problems, software is fine,activated with no problems overall am very happy with my buy thank you so much."
"Apple",2,"Not refurbished very well. It acts up and has trouble at times with certain actions. It did have a new screen, though, so that part seems fine."
"Apple",5,"I have been using this refurbed device every day, all day. It works perfect, and when my account is up for renewal, I will be upgrading to the 5."
"Apple",2,"I received the iphone in good condition. The problem I had was that I could not capitalize any words which was a problem. Other than that the phone was as advertised. I returned the phone without any hassles and received a prompt refund."
"Apple",5,"its like a brand new iphone 4s sans the box. Arrived promptly. There was a sticker on the bubble wrap covering the phone stating it was an 8 GB phone so for a bit I thought I had been duped. But then checked the iphone memory and it is indeed a 32 GB.Very pleased!!!!!"
"Apple",4,"Came with a weird screen but everything was functioning properly. I bought it used, so it was better than expected."
"Apple",3,"Due to a number of factors I decided to downgrade from an iPhone 5 to an iPhone 4 - wish I wouldn't have done that. The service, delivery and price was good but the phone was certainly a step down."
"Apple",2,"love the phone but was a little disappointed when I found out the bottom left speaker wasnt working and the ad said fully functional."
"Apple",5,"It is great to receive a phone that was affordable its so easy to use screen is easy to see"
"Apple",4,"I am very happy with this phone. It was a gift for my son. Just wish there were more directions included ."
"Apple",5,"Not only was this phone everything I expected, it came earlier than projected!! This was a great buying experience and I would use this merchant again for any similar purchase."
"Apple",5,"I was worried about purchasing this phone due to the other reviews I read, however it came brand new as promised. Everything works well except for the speaker phone. I don't ever really use it so its not a huge deal."
"Apple",5,"The Apple Iphone is a great product, I will not go without it, this is my first try with an Apple product and I was not let down."
"Apple",5,"Great ui on iOS 7"
"Apple",1,"When attempted to activate it was reported as a stolen device."
"Apple",1,"Phone accordingly is new but upon checked by apple store it is fake. Could not get any cell signal."
"Apple",5,"Great phone but the description needed to be clearer."
"Apple",1,"hello good morning, this is to place you iphone sim card? for use in Venezuela thank you waiting for your reply"
"Apple",5,"I purchased this to replace my son's stolen iphone. This phone arrived quickly, brand new in original packaging. It is working very well on our Verizon network. We are well pleased."
"Apple",5,"It's been a year & this phone still runs great with a good battery. The unlocked version is perfect for people who switch plans a lot. A great purchase for anyone deciding on using an iPhone."
"Apple",5,"I had previously bought an iPhone 4 from a different seller, which had turned out to be defective. This one was cheater and works like a charm! Amazing!"
"Apple",5,"downgraded from v 5 & very happy... needs to last until my contract comes do. May not trade it in."
"Apple",5,"I had before a Samsung iii, very expensive cellphone, nice, big screen, but for some reason my wife didn't like it, so we decided to buy an iphone and give it a try.This is definitely a good product, fast response, excellent sensor on the touch screen, nice, clean... and the best of all was that we paid a reasonable price for this refurbished item, which looks like new, with minor blemished. my wife is really happy and now she just need to learn how to use it."
"Apple",2,"So I was on iTunes the ither day and I connected my phone to download music and I found out that they sold me a 16GB!!! And I paid $213."
"Apple",1,"We bought 3 phones from Pure Mobility in December for our three kids as Christmas gifts. By March my son's phone was not working right, the on/off switch didn't work. He took it to the local Apple Store to be told that it was a pre-owned phone & had been repaired before, plus, the warranty was no longer valid due to it originally being purchased over a year ago. Now, in May, my daughter's phone does not work AT ALL! This is only 5 months after buying it! She took her phone to the Apple Store & was told the same thing...it was pre-owned AND repaired before we bought it, therefore, they can do nothing about it.We are very unhappy with our purchase and would not advise any one to purchase from Pure Mobility.When we contacted Pure Mobility, they told us that there was nothing they could do about it!! Can you believe that?!We feel that we just threw almost $1,000 in the trash."
"Apple",5,"Great experience, I got a brand new iPhone 4 32gb. For verizon in the original sealed box with everything that it comes with(OH DID I MENTION IT CAME 3 DAYS EARLIER THAN EXPECTED) SUPER HAPPY WITH THIS SELLERI will buy my future electronics from just incase"
"Apple",1,"phone stopped working after a month.. very disappointed with phone. speakers barely worked from the beginning. cant operate phone unless on speakerphone"
"Apple",5,"It' great I just did not realize that I got a 4 i thought it was a 4's but my bad.But the phone has been great the only problem I have with it is the volume is very low and I away mute the phone when I'm talking on it."
"Apple",1,"I bought an iPhone 4 32 GB that was supposed to be in NEW condition. When receiving the phone it worked well for a couple of months, then suddenly the phone screen completely shut off. The next day I took it to the Apple Store and had them look at it. The Apple associate then told me that the phone had been refurbished with third party parts and the screen had been replaced, and since the phone had the 3rd party parts, I was unable to get it fixed. I have emailed the seller about this, thinking perhaps it was a confusion, but they have not responded."
"Apple",1,"We bought this Iphone with the belief that it was a new phone, had it less then two weeks when the screen started to flicker, change colors randomly. Took it to an apple store, they informed me that the screen was not aligned with the camera, they inputted the serial number of the phone, and discovered that it was out of warranty, had it been brand new as expected, there would have been a years worth of warranty left on it, my 11 year old daughter is EXTREMELY disappointed in having her dream phone not even work for two weeks, some bday present huh."
"Apple",1,"Nowhere in the item description (at least easily read) does it state the item is only 3G. I understand the seller shouldn't have to state ""not 4G,"" but it should at least state that it is 3G. I am now having to pay to return the phone. Why would I change from one 3G phone to another? Cosmetically, the phone was in excellent condition. The cord, however, was worn and dirty.Buy ONLY if you want a 3G phone."
"Apple",5,"Having held out until recently T&P purchase new phone, this model of iPhone has been an outstanding purchase. User friendly as training video clips explain function from name persrectives."
"Apple",5,"Mine was listed as ""Used"" and in ""Good"" condition. What arrived was a factory new phone that had the shrink wrap removed the box so it could be sold as ""used"". I can't say that you will receive the same but I am very happy with mine!"
"Apple",3,"I had to return this product as it was not the one I was looking for ! It was ordered accidentally ,I needed GSM instead of CDMA.I face difficulty in returning this product but thanks to Amazon customer service which supported me well."
"Apple",4,"Ok delivery was very speedy 4-5 days...!! Phone was in great condition physically. The camera was damaged tho. Flash was no good! Overall, i didnt get what i ordered; which was an unlocked sim card enabled device, therfore i had to return it asap.:("
"Apple",5,"I bought this iPhone 4, It is in new condition. It arrived promptly. Excellent seller. now I am looking for someone to unlock this great phone here in Venezuela!!!!!!"
"Apple",5,"I bought the iPhone 4 for my wife. It is in new condition. It arrived promptly. My wife absolutely loves it. Excellent seller. Highly recommend.Jerry"
"Apple",5,"This 32gb iphone let's me download what I want I don't have to keep seeing how much space I have left because I know I have more than enough on board and the phone is in good condition! Love it"
"Apple",1,"As mentioned in numerous other reviews, the trade in service for phones is a scam. I sent my phone in with a ""good"" rating which is described as ""shows wear from normal use"" and ""light scratches on the body."" My phone was exactly as described. It looked like it had been used, but was in no way, shape or form ""heavily scratched."" Long story short I got $100 less on my trade-in because, as the email stated, it was ""heavily scratched."" That is quite a stretch of the truth and rather insulting. If you plan to trade a phone in, expect to get the absolute minimum amount regardless of the condition."
"Apple",3,"The phone was in good shape like promised but you would think that if someone just paid 254.00 for a USED phone that it would at least come with a phone charger. Plus the phone didn't have the capibility of being activated from the phone. So not only do I have to go up to the verizon store to PAY to have it activated but I also have to spend more money for a charger."
"Apple",1,"Camera looks like I was standing in a cloud of smoke. I loved the camera on my old phone but this one is completely useless. I wouldn't buy another used phone ever."
"Apple",5,"While the phone was as described, it was not 'unlocked' as was touted. It was locked to AT&T. I had to pay to get it usable in my part of the globe. I would buy from this seller again."
"Apple",5,"This phone will grow on you. It is not only useful for making phone calls but serves as a mini computer and reference device for any number of tasks. It also allows you to carry with you the latest books and newspapers. It will not only lighten the amount of paper you might carry but will entertain you also.This device is highly recommended to anyone who is on the go and has no time to sit down at a desktop or lap to reference information."
"Apple",3,"This Device works fine on some days but then won't work at all on others. The speaker seems to go out a lot and more frequently now since it has been used for a month now?"
"Apple",5,"Excellent conditions, working at 100%"
"Apple",5,"So far so good. Still learning the ins and outs of the phone and all it has to offer."
"Apple",5,"An iPhone that was current but inexpensive. Good price, good product, Excellent condition .Super fast shipping.I am very pleased to deal with you.Thanks.."
"Apple",1,"I had to send my first phone back after only having it for 2 weeks....the home button stopped working. got my 2nd phone right away but now I am having a problem with the turn on/off button. Whats the deal with these phones?"
"Apple",1,"I`M HAVING PROBLEM WITH CHARGING IT, CAN NOT BE FULLY CHARGE"
"Apple",5,"Awesome!"
"Apple",5,"Could not have been in better condition for a product that was already used!"
"Apple",5,"great"
"Apple",4,"Was just as I expected ecelent"
"Apple",5,"Excellent value, product as stated"
"Apple",5,"Product as described, good value"
"Apple",5,"thank you. great experience!"
"Apple",3,"I like the phone itself though when I first got it I had to do a software update. Also my charger base is already not working and needing to be replaced. It doesn't keep a charge for as long as I would like. It seems to take forever to charge via computer or in my vehicle."
"Apple",1,"I took the phone to Verizon store to transfer the info from my old phone to this new one. They couldn't because they said the phone wouldn't respond. Needless to say I had to return the phone and wait 4 weeks for my refund."
"Apple",1,"Quit working after a week. Just shuts off. Will turn on for about 5 mins after reset or hooked to a charger. Replaced battery. Still no go."
"Apple",4,"the home button was kinda not working you have to hold for a long time to access home"
"Apple",5,"Excellent."
"Apple",1,"The phone I bought was new but was so slow, the screen was dark even on the highest setting, and random things would pop up for sign in. Apps ran super slow, especially maps, and siri didn't even work.Worst phone I ever bought I returned. LISTEN TO ME don't buy this phone. You will regret."
"Apple",4,"Phone came in great condition, looks brand new! Activated without problems and is the 32gb as ordered. Came in the box with the charger and headphones. Snapchat is acting a little funny and the emoji keyboard but other than that no problems at all. Verizon said I got a great deal!"
"Apple",5,"The product was as stated. Very pleased."
"Apple",3,"The phone works, was packaged as new but the charger did not work."
"Apple",5,"Veery good phone love it"
"Apple",5,"LOVE my phone. It has been working great. Very impressed."
"Apple",1,"I was unable to activate the phone with my provider. They told me that the phone had been reported stolen, and as a result when trying to activate it, Apple locked it down so it cannot be used as anything but a paper weight."
"Apple",2,"Lasted only 1year. Crapped out! Does not work after 1year. Oh well."
"Apple",5,"i love my cracked iphone 4!!!"
"Apple",2,"The phone we bought melted within 1 month of purchase (used)due to the battery."
"Apple",3,"not bad but it is old some games will freeze and I didn't get earbuds"
"Apple",4,"The battery hasn't got much life"
"Apple",1,"Got a great deal on this but the battery has very shortage which is why I replaced an older version"
"Apple",4,"Love it and was so worth the price! I try amazon for everything for purchase now! Especially because I had no idea the gigs were worth more! Lol"
"Apple",3,"this is good"
"Apple",5,"i have insurance with my service provider and i still had to cuff up $180 for a replacement phone, no thanks.but this the day before and got it the next day, for only $120 with 4 times the memory!!!!"
"Apple",1,"Phone was ordered on 5/18 and delivered on 5/21, worked great first two days and then started mesing up all the screens jump and when taking a picture the screen goes red and green. Went to request a return to find out its return window expired on 5/22 the day after it was delivered. Have tried contacting the seller but have not had anyone return my call.. Very Disappointed!"
"Apple",3,"It has to be charged too much.It will only last for 2 days. It has small fonts and there was no instruction."
"Apple",5,"The iphone is really good. it was in great condition it even included earphones and a charger. Everything works fine. It was delivered sooner than what i anticipated."
"Apple",4,"I enjoy the phone a lot. It is the only phone that i want to use. It is the one that i wanted"
"Apple",3,"Everything works but the main button to get thru the many screens doesn't work. Had it checked out by a repair shop and it sticks. For the price, I am satisfied."
"Apple",5,"I ordered two iphone 4's. My son lost his and I've been wanting one for a while but didn't want to pay full price from Verizon and I'm not eligible for an upgrade yet. I haven't connected mine up to my service yet but my son has been using his for about a month now. He's had no problems and it works great. It was brand new right out of the box with the charger and earbuds."
"Apple",1,"The phone I bought through Amazon was stolen. When I went to have it activated at the Verizon store the sales clerk told me it had been reported stolen. Luckily I was able to get a refund from Amazon. How disappointing! I have not bought one single electronic item from Amazon since and may not in the future due to this experience."
"Apple",5,"I love this phone I was super excited to get this phone, I lost my ipod touch and didn't and decided to get an iphone instead of replacing the ipod. That was one of my best decisions. I would recommend this product to any and everyone."
"Apple",1,"I had a defective speaker in the first month. I sent it back to VERY HQS and they asked if I would take the phone back if they fixed the speaker. I agreed to it for a slight reduction in price. About 2 months after that my home button started having problems. Its gotten now into the fourth month. This is a lemon. I asked for a refund for this phone that keeps having problems. They refused to take it back. Thanks VERY HQS for your customer service."
"Apple",1,"I was excited to get my very first smart phone. The item was purchased as being NEW. I received it and had loved the I Phone until a few days ago when I was only able to make calls using the speaker phone. I took the phone to Apple and they took it apart and informed me that the phone was refurbished-there was not original Apple parts in there so they would not repair the phone. I am not unhappy with Apple or Amazon. But the company that supplied this item-I have never felt to tricked, ripped off, and taken for a ride. Amazon, luckily, was nice enough to at least stand by their promise and issue a full refund, even though the purchase was a bit past the thirty days. Will I use Amazon again? Yes. Apple? Yes. This supplier? NOOOO!! RIP OFF!!!!"
"Apple",4,"Well for one thing i didn't get a new one and when i did get it, it had a very volgure e-mail left on it (rapepornog ) what the rest was i can't remeber, and there was still some chinese writing left on it, i was lucky to get it off, so i really do think ALL THE PHONES SHOOULD BE LOOKED OVER A WHOLE LOT BETTER THAN THEY ARE??????????"
"Apple",1,"Tried to activate this phone and it would not due to the fact that it was a AT & T phone. I would suggest the owner or company of this phone change the title description."
"Apple",5,"when i ordered I thougth that is going to look used, but when i got it. was wrap it as new and when i open it, was perfect clean like a new i i ordered used, and since i buyed is working perfecly."
"Apple",5,"This item was exactly as advertised-in perfect condition, no scratches, and works perfectly. I intended to buy a 4S, but the 4 is great and Siri is not really necessary."
"Apple",3,"though i ve been using the phone regularly i will b taking it to the apple store to exchange it the home button rarely works and the which means i had to put one on the screen and the screen doesnt shut off due to a faulty proxy sensor which means when im talking i either mute people out or im bumping buttons leaving loud beeping noises in the other persons ear"
"Apple",5,"This phone is perfect. It came in the original packaging and works beautifully. More than I expected. I definitely recommend this"
"Apple",5,"Love it!"
"Apple",5,"love it"
"Apple",4,"Seller is Legit, I bought a $68 Verizon iPhone 4 32gb- and it came with a free wall charger. ‘’Sooo happy’’, you should buy from this seller. The only thing about the iPhone 4 model is on the back of the iPhone it says made in China but manufactures in California-( this means it might be an old copy). IT runs on iOS 7.1.2 and has no panorama or other features like iOS 8 or Siri."
"Apple",4,"It was what I wanted."
"Apple",5,"It arrive quickly and in perfect working order."
"Apple",1,"Was disappointed with the phone from day one . I dealt with it as I was due for an upgrade in a few months. I would not recommend buying a refurbished phone from anyone."
"Apple",5,"great item thanks"
"Apple",5,"The phone was shipped right away and was as advertised."
"Apple",5,"Why spern so much on a new phone when mine has been serving me for almost a year now, will upgrade with another used phone when the price goes down"

"Apple",5,"EXCELLANT AND IN SERVICE NOW"
"Apple",5,"Works like a dream.... very very nice"
"Apple",4,"It's an iPhone- there's not too much more to say. It works great with all our other Apple products and the price was excellent for the large memory. I've been happy with it so far."
"Apple",5,"This phone is AMAZING It works so well"
"Apple",1,"It freezes up 2 much and stop working"
"Apple",5,"Great iphone, excellent price."
"Apple",5,"Everything is great. Phone works good no scratches or anything. All the buttons work ... Doesn't move slow (yet). But honestly I will buy phones like this from now on. 80 bucks you can't beat that."
"Apple",5,"Phone did not work right and the seller took care of problem fast happy with result"
"Apple",3,"I cannot used, because I'm from Venezuela, and here cannot use CDMA. But is a good phone if you are in USA"
"Apple",5,"Great value for the price. iPhone was clean and was received promptly."
"Apple",5,"Muito bom"
"Apple",5,"Perfect condition not a scratch came on time couldn't be happier works great!!!"
"Apple",1,"Advertised as new but was definitely used before. The phone wouldn't connect to itunes or even my computer. The phone wasn't even showing up in the device manager at all, not even as an unknown device. A day after receiving the phone, the screen got lots of white streaks on it and starts flashing uncontrollably. Basically the phone I received was unusable."
"Apple",1,"this was advertised as New in package. the phone was received with a defect in the screen (shaking icons). after contacting apple, the unit was identified as a ""refurbished"" phone. ""refurbished"" does NOT equal NEW."
"Apple",5,"Wonderful item. Great purchase"
"Apple",5,"We received the phone on time &!it was exactly in the condition promised. We were very happy with everything! Thanx"
"Apple",5,"This phone is amazing except one of my speakers didn't work when I took it out of the package."
"Apple",5,"Perfect! Very pleased! It was listed as like new and was indeed in new condition. The phone is working great (on Net10) and no regrets on this purchase!"
"Apple",4,"Good phone but probably paid more than I should have!"
"Apple",1,"defective phone that was received later than the express date that was paid for."
"Apple",5,"Good"
"Apple",3,"It didn't meet my expectation because it had no sim slot available."
"Apple",1,"I hate the iPhone I purchased and am now searching to replace it. I will never buy another iPhone."
"Apple",1,"Volume would not work..."
"Apple",4,"The home button doesn't work all the time but it is a used phone and I can work around the home button. Arrived promptly with no problems."
"Apple",5,"Awesome buy! I appreciate the nice communication between seller and I. Phone is in great condition and also came with a case and phone charger! Thank you"
"Apple",1,"I want my money back!! What a disappoint :( never expected this to happen to me "
"Apple",1,"The bluetooth doesn't work since I bought it, bad, bad, bad"
"Apple",1,"So bad"
"Apple",5,"very good phone, had no problems with it."
"Apple",4,"service was great, iPhone is a 4, all I could afford, and slow compared to my 4g. Still, I like the phone."
"Apple",1,"I purchased this phone in June 2014, and now October of 2014, not even 5 months later I have to have the button that turns it off and on replaced. Not a happy person!"
"Apple",5,"sold it and bought it back works well"
"Apple",1,"Very disappointed with this phone. The charger base never worked from day one. It has given me constant trouble. It even wiped out all my contacts, pictures, and texts. I will have to bring it to the Apple store to see if they can fix it."
"Apple",1,"NO SIM VERZION"
"Apple",5,"fast shipping. recieved better than described. only negative was phone was left on during shipping"
"Apple",5,"Just as described. Fast delivery"
"Apple",1,"The phone didn't work..the sensor was broken so every time I tried to make a call it would continually dial. The battery was Also broken, the phone wouldn't keep a charge"
"Apple",5,"Great! Fast shipping! Good product!"
"Apple",1,"I do not like, do not have to put chip and telnologia very old and could not put any line. i lost my money"
"Apple",1,"Phone wouldn't work 10 minutes after I got it. I've only had it for 5 hours. When I first turned it on, it took forever and I noticed these lines going across the screen. At first it would go black if I was on it for more than 30 seconds now the screen keeps fading black everytime I try to unlock it and will randomely shut off. Seems to me like water damage because this is what happened to my last iphone I got wet. So in that case this is a scam."
"Apple",5,"this product is great so far bought it for Christmas so don't know how long it will last but the price you cant beat and always amazon is great so well pleased"
"Apple",5,"I love the Apple phone.This is a outstanding deal and phone. I don't like writing a book to tell you about this. Deal"
"Apple",5,"My granddaughter is thrilled with the phone which she will use until the family plan is qualified for renewal and then move up to the latest iPhone available at the time!"
"Apple",1,"This phone was a lemon. It looked great when it arrived, but the battery was near death, and after a few days the Home Button stopped working. The screen wouldn't react to tough, either. It was a very frustrating ordeal. I hope they don't turn around and pass it off onto someone else.It's time to through that baby away."
"Apple",5,"This was a gift for my son. He really likes the phone and keeps it close by all the time."
"Apple",5,"My daughter wanted a iPhone for Christmas! Found this one Cyber Monday for a GREAT deal with all the accessories brand new in the box. Phone works great"
"Apple",4,"Phone was delivered promptly. I was worried that phone may be used or wouldn't connect with Verizon. Phone appears to be new and I had no problems connecting with Verizon. I have issues with several apps, but I don't consider that the seller's fault. Phone won't download entire I-tunes library and the maps doesn't have a voice feature. ."
"Apple",5,"Works like an absolute charm. The seller got this too me EXTREMELY speedy and was extremely nice. Never ever had any problem with it and I've had it for almost 2 months now. Works beautifully."
"Apple",5,"Phone was in great shape just as promised in original box daughter was very happy."

"Apple",5,"The only way to go"

"Apple",5,"I love my iPhone 4 . Is just what I need it. Everything work perfectly . I recommend this phone to everyone."
"Apple",1,"This is to indicate that the product sold by you (CELL APPLE IPHONE 4 8GB WHITE), has multiple fractures at the level of the housing on the front and rear. Importantly, I have been waiting for this product from the 18/04/13 to give a gift to my daughter and I find this inconvenient.It is right that before dispatching the product to be reviewed, and that came in very, very bad shape, so I causes additional expense here in Venezuela for repair. I feel cheated and deceived by this situation.I would like an answer to this from you."
"Apple",4,"It is not opened, because it is a gift, so I have not used it.I need to wait for my friend told me that you like it and feel used."
"Apple",1,"I'm pissed, I didn't even get the freaking order.. it took the money out of my account, but I never got it."
"Apple",1,"This iphone4 cost me twenty dollars in gas and a day's work trying to get this phone fixed. I went back and forth from an apple store and my service provider. Apple gave me a new phone because the one I purchased was still under warranty. After spending all day trying to get the phone to work the apple service rep went in the back room and got the original phone and did a history check from the original owner up until I got the phone. Status unlocked: False. The apple rep told me they could not change the status of the phone they were required to return my new phone with the same set up as the old phone. The apple rep said until the person or company I got the phone from change the settings to factory unlocked there would not be anything I could do with this phone. I sent an email to Amazon about the problem and they were going to contact the provider with this issue. To date I have heard nothing from the provider or Amazon. If I could rate the product with a zero star I would. Right now I have spent over three hundred dollars out of my pocket and lost a day's work. The best thing I could do with this phone is make a boat anchor with it but it would not even be good for that. I found out by trying to save money it would have been better just to buy a new phone. I guess the old saying holds true you get what you pay for."
"Apple",5,"It's good. Shipping is soon. The customer service is excellent.Prompt delivery. everything came as described and now my phone works and it didn't cost me a fortune or a new phone."
"Apple",5,"I recieved my Iphone4 in the mail and was so excited to see that it was practically brand new. No scratches, no visible defects just like as the description said. I love it and I would order again from the seller!"
"Apple",5,"Perfect!"

"Apple",5,"I purchased the iPhone 4. I am extremely pleased with the product. The phone is in great condition, it looks brand new. It came with a charger, headphones, and a quality Outterbox phone case. I got the phone activated at Ntelos with no problem and everything works perfectly. Also, shipping was very fast. I would recommend this seller! Thanks for the wonderful purchase!"
"Apple",1,"Is not good."
"Apple",5,"amazing, works great, looked brand new and the charger worked fine"
"Apple",5,"Came on time, phone in great condition. I am a happy customer and thinking about buying another!"
"Apple",1,"The ear piece doesn't work the only way i can use it is on speaker. Also if i had known that this was not the 4S as advertized but only a four when i received it i would have never let you rip me off!"
"Apple",5,"EXCELLENT !! Would deal with again !!"
"Apple",4,"Ordered over the weekend and received on thursday. Both phones looked new and no problem activating with a verizon MVNO."
"Apple",4,"Charger was defective"
"Apple",5,"Great"
"Apple",4,"It was fine:"
"Apple",1,"Sent it back. Wouldn't hold a charge"
"Apple",3,"It blocks the signal of calls or wifi signal"
"Apple",5,"The phone was brand new and in the original packaging, sealed with plastic, with a charger and earbuds. That being said, I wish I'd known that iPhone 4's can't update past iOS 7.1.2 because that requires a dual processor. The iPhone 4s has a dual processor and can handle a more recent update. Many apps don't function on such an old operating system, so there is some stuff I would like to use that I will never be able to on this phone. But if you want an iPhone 4 this is exactly as advertised."
"Apple",5,"Yes excellent thanks"
"Apple",5,"I received it the way I wanted it"
"Apple",4,"Good!"
"Apple",5,"Love it"
"Apple",3,"Phone is great but charger did not work at all"
"Apple",4,"works fine. It's just a little slow"
"Apple",5,"man i order this on December 29, 2015 and it said it will be arriving Janurary 5-8 but it came Janurary 2,2016 and it works came with charger only think wrong with it is that it comes dead i made sure to plug in and see if it works but i recommend it to anyone trying to buy this"
"Apple",5,"Great condition. Thanks."
"Apple",1,"worst phone I ever gotten. I got this phone last year for 250 dollars, now its 150? recently I traded this phone in to verizon.I had an old iPhone 4 when I came in and now I came out with an iPhone 6s for cheap!"
"Apple",5,"It was labeled used/good but was like new :)"
"Apple",5,"Bought this for my husband and was extremely pleased!!!"
"Apple",5,"the item came faster then excepted. And easy to set up."
"Apple",5,"My grandson was absolutely thrilled with this gift. This is all he wanted for Christmas but I knew I couldn't afford a brand new one.When I saw this one, and the price, I couldn't believe that it was in such good shape (from the picture). Then when it arrived, I found that it was brand new, never been activated, or even had the plastic film taken off the screen............and I paid less than $70 for it. I went back & re-read the description of how Amazon classes ""new, used, good"" and although this one was listed as ""used"", the only thing missing was the original box but for a savings I got, the box was irrelevant. I gave him his Christmas present early to make sure everything was ok with it, and it was, so he is one happy kid."
"Apple",1,"You cannot get this phone networking card for this phone with straight talk will not work"
"Apple",5,"You cannot beat an iPhone on Straighttalk. The only draw back. No service for WiFI hotspot. Othet than that great phone, great service."
"Apple",4,"Ok"
"Apple",5,"I really like this purchase it was a great buy...everything is perfect with this product."
"Apple",5,"Very satisfied with my purchase! I ordered the refurbished version from a seller New York it arrived in less than a week and all I had to do was call straight talk and pay 8$ to get my number transferred with my minutes and in less than 5 minutes I was using my IPhone... I love this phone"
"Apple",3,"For being a refurbished phone I say this phone is great. I haven't put minutes on it yet but will be soon. Wanted to get to know the phone 1st since it is my 1st iPhone. So far no problems with it expect when I use certain apps it drains my battery."
"Apple",1,"I like the iPhone but I order a iPhone 4 not a iPhone 3 but other wise it was good and I want straight talk phone not Verizon ."
"Apple",5,"Had no problem whatsoever adding it to a pre-existing straight talk account. it works perfectly. thanks."
"Apple",1,"I'm very disappointed in this apple."
"Apple",3,"It was ok"
"Apple",5,"had fears of a used cell phone but love this one, straight talk set it up for us in just a few mins."
"Apple",5,"I love this product !! Works perfectly! Although I did have a bit of trouble setting it up with straight talk it wasn't the phones issue it was the straight talk company itself. When I tried to to activate it online 5 times within a 2 days period the website told me something different each time ,but I eventually called the straight talk hot line and I explained my situation and she fixed it within 10 minutes and if anyone tells you your issue is that it's with verizon don't listen to them because straight talk uses the verizon towers ,but overall I can't complain I even went to a different state with the phone and had excellent service! I also like how sturdy it is lol I've dropped it many times and it hasn't scratched or cracked at all"
"Apple",1,"I received the phone and it wasn't straighttalk. I had to sit on the phone with straighttalk for an hour to pay a network fee of 6.99. Now. Two hours later. I am still sitting here waiting for it to be activated. And when I call the number it tell me it's unable to do it. I am severely irritated with this product n"
"Apple",5,"Great product I love this phone works with straight talk"
"Apple",3,"For the price not worth it. Makes a loud screeching noise during conversation speaker not loud enough"
"Apple",5,"Got here fast, nice, new, and very helpful directions on how to set up with straight talk included. REALLY WORKS WITH STRAIGHT TALK. No problems getting it going. Love the phone. Very satisfied, even with it being a 6 yr old phone. Very much worth the small price you pay!"
"Apple",5,"Bought it for my daughter and she enjoys it."
"Apple",5,"Excellent"
"Apple",3,"The phone is great. The problem is the product description. I bought this phone thinking it was for straight talk (product description). I went to the store. Purchased the card and then tried to activate the phone. I was on the phone for an hour with straight talk. They kept telling me they couldn't identify the phone. They couldn't activate it, nothing. As I'm on the phone with them I am looking at the about section for the phone and that's when I see Carrier: Verizon. My phone was not for straight talk. It was for Verizon. After reading more and more reviews from others about this phone I saw that some people were having the same problem as me. I went onto Verizon and had the phone activated in ten minutes. Phone is great. Came with charger and ear buds. Just be sure to check the carrier listed on the phone."
"Apple",5,"Shopping was very quick. Everything came with it in box and all. Brand new phone and had no problem with setting it up with Straight Talk. I love it. The only thing is that I didn't know so that's my fault is you have to pay $6.99 for the access code basically to activate it unless you buy your own activation set up kit."
"Apple",5,"I was impressed with the condition of the phone. It didn't even look like it was ever used. My daughter was very happy with the phone. Thank you."
"Apple",5,"this is good phone, and good merchant the phone came in perfect condition  and the delivered was quick.. I like it a lot... I am a satisfied costumer..good thanks"
"Apple",4,"The phone itself was dusty inside the box. The phone was unscratched and we were able to get it activated after buying an activation package. It runs a but slower than expected which is why I gave 4 out of 5 stars."
"Apple",4,"Came unopened,brand new. Which is something I was kinda worried about. Works wonderfully. Has a glitche,but what phone doesn't? Nothing that's unmanageable. Other than that great buy!"
"Apple",5,"Very good stuff I love it"
"Apple",4,"Great Iphone 4 Great Condition Works Well, I Love it Thanks -Chinks"
"Apple",1,"Is NOT A STTAIGHTTALK PHONE FOR VERIZON ONLY"
"Apple",4,"it was good"
"Apple",3,"Decent but there are some serious errors in its shippment and description. pros: no damage, came in box (sealed) , with charger and headphones. cons: its meant to be used for a verizon phone only, and cannot be converted to straight talk (regular sim card slots were not built in), and it came with no phone card like promised and described. overall: good phone and i like it, but it simply wasnt what i ordered! blame: the sellers of the phone (ship fast tech llc) who did not deliver what they promised in their ad, used false advertising, and have not altered it even after similiar or more critical reviews refered to the straight talk dilemma. if u want striaght talk, dotn buy this, if you dotn care and just want an iphone 4, go ahead, but watch out, you might not be a lucky as me."
"Apple",1,"This would have been a cool phone but there was a big problem for me ... the battery life was not good however seller I bought from which wAs iconvertwireless the owner Matt was absolutely so courteous and professional when I wanted a return he issued a full refund just as he told me he would I wouldn't recommend the phone but definitely recommend iconvertwireless very good seller ."
"Apple",5,"No issue"
"Apple",4,"""Sikksound "" the seller sent it in almost new condition it arrived quickly and works good my only complaint is that one speaker doesent work"
"Apple",5,"We are very satisfied with the phone, it has worked better than expected. We were told it would work in some area codes in our area, but so far it has worked for us. Would recommend this phone and the no contract plan."
"Apple",5,"CALL Today OK"
"Apple",1,"I don't like this phone. Battery dies 4x a day it's not what I expected at all!"
"Apple",3,"So I never had an iPhone wanted to try I say to try it out was wonderful and I love iPhone I got a iPhone 6 now and I love mine but the iPhone 4 is still great good see if u like it"
"Apple",5,"Thank you!! phone was in beautiful shape!! everything worked perfectly and shipping was super fast!! will buy from seller again!!! HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!! A +++"
"Apple",1,"I don't know how to activate it to straight talk?"
"Apple",5,"Thank yu everything was as you said"
"Apple",5,"The phone came before I thought it would and it works great!"
"Apple",5,"Great product"
"Apple",5,"Love it"
"Apple",1,"Phone did not work for straight talk.. And the back of the phone did not look like an apple phone, no symbol or anything"
"Apple",5,"great phone no problems. good deal and good condition"
"Apple",2,"I Ordered this phone last week, I got it yesterday, and on the Box that it came in said it is a straight talk phone, even gave me the meid number but I am having a very hard time activating it, stayed on phone with straight talk all day yesterday and its still not activated."
"Apple",3,"Phone works great. But the charger was broke. Had to buy a new one :/"
"Apple",5,"So far so good"
"Apple",5,"I can't lie the phone came fast. The condition of the phone was in great condition. Also it was easy to activate, took me about 10 mins. So I'll give it 5 stars and will recommend it to anybody"
"Apple",5,"I bought this for my 15 years olds birthday. This was exactly as described! No scratches...perfect condition...beautiful!! It came within a timely manner and works perfectly on straight talk! I will definitely use them again with my next phone purchase. Extremely happy!!"
"Apple",1,"Mine doesn't even work for straight talk! I got a verizon phone that isn't compatible. What a waste!"
"Apple",5,"i m so satisfied with this phone and the seller was extremely nice and even put a little letter in with the device to help me set my phone up with straight talk carrier. With her help, it was so easy to set up the phone. if i ever need to buy another in the future, i know were to go to! :D"
"Apple",5,"A+++++++++"
"Apple",5,"The first rating I gave on this phone was given because I hadn't received the phone yet. Now that I have received it my rating on it is excellent. Other than the fact it didn't come with charger when it was shown in the picture next to the phone. Never the less the phone is in very good condition. Was a good buy. I would recommend buying it."
"Apple",3,"Only gave me one charger for two phones."
"Apple",2,"Disappointed! I love iPhones. I'm a big fan. I wanted to get my daughter-in-law an iPhone for her Straight Talk service, so I bought her one of these. I was able to activate it with Straight Talk after talking to their customer service and we transferred her number over no problem, but after only a week her phone's screen randomly started going black, and she has to power it off then back on every time it does that. Highly inconvenient. Sadly, we are disappointed with this phone."
"Apple",5,"worked perfect will order again when ready"
"Apple",5,"Got it for a Christmas present for my daughter, she loves it, her first iPhone"
"Apple",3,"It was a used phone so there was some problems with it. Other than that it was fine."
"Apple",1,"They will get you phones are not unlocked!"
"Apple",5,"Was a bit difficult to set up with phone carrier, but great phone after that. Charger broke after a month, but all apple chargers are expected to do that. No problems with speakers/charging port/ buttons"
"Apple",5,"In an otter box, fell off the bed and screen went dead and was completely unusable. Stay away from I-anything.I gave it 5 stars because the seller got it to me quick and its no their fault the iphone sucks."
"Apple",5,"bought this for my daughter for christmas and she loves it!I also found that it shipped fast and Bella Rose is very kind! Thank you!"
"Apple",5,"I ordered this phone and i can say i am very impresses! I love it this is my first time having a iphone and i love it nomo android team iphone:)"
"Apple",2,"out of date"
"Apple",5,"First smart phone, a positive experience"
"Apple",1,"Not happy it said for straight talk and it was not!!"
"Apple",4,"Awesome phone"
"Apple",5,"Witch towers would I pick up with this phone"
"Apple",5,"Works great. My sound/vibrate button is a little messed up but just at times. Love it"
"Apple",5,"Awesome phone and transaction went smoothly."
"Apple",1,"Piece of crap, has water damage and does not work."
"Apple",5,"Received quickly and works great. No problem getting phone number switched over and phone works with straight talk."
"Apple",5,"Great"
"Apple",4,"Received the phone early which is a definite plus since I'm impatient. Looks brand new and got it all set up with no issues. The only issue I had was I was not aware that it didn't come with a charger before I bought it. No biggy since I can get one at any gas station."
"Apple",5,"I love my phone it came way earlier than it was supposed to. It did not come with headphones but it came with everything else mentioned. My sisters are even buying phones from here I recommend it !"
"Apple",3,"I purchased this phone without permission from my friend and i need to know how to return it please text me asap 7753010423"
"Apple",5,"Just what we were looking for.Reasonably priced good condition.Fast service.Would recommend to anyone.Was a gift granddaughter loves it.Thinking of finding one for myself."
"Apple",4,"I greatly appreciated the fact that it DID INDEED come before christmas. I didnt recieve any texts or emails of where the package was at any given time. You should work on that. But it was a good feeling to see my little brothers face when he opened his present and saw a new iphone. Thnxs :3"
"Apple",2,"When I received the phone, it came in a ziplock bag with a sticker on it, plus the straight talk card. In order to get the phone to work I had to update the phone and spend over an hour on the phone with tech support (in India) and the WiFi still will not work. I expected more."
"Apple",1,"I bought this phone of the 4th of December and shouldve received it by the 18th as a Christmas present but it got here the 27th. This phone was to be used for Straight Talk, only the sim card that is sent with the phone isnt for Straight Talk so you will need to buy a different SIM card. There were no instructions, no order form. I am still waiting for the seller to contact me so I can return it!!! Do not order this phone! Its not worth the headache! You'd be better off buying a brand new IPhone for a few more dollars."
"Apple",5,"It a great phone and worth the price! It's fast and easy to use. It's easy to set up. I am very happy with it."
"Apple",4,"Okay so here's the real download on this phone. It was in perfect shape when I got it. However, I was so pissed trying to get it attached to Straighttalk. I spent four hours and wasted $60 on it. These phones have certain carriers and unless they are unlocked you can't go with just any carrier. Thankfully I got smart and decided to see what carrier it went with. VERIZON! I went to Verizon's prepaid sight and hooked it up within 5 minutes."
"Apple",5,"Great"
"Apple",5,"Great product! Will order again. I want one too!"
"Apple",5,"Great"
"Apple",5,"good"
"Apple",5,"Everything was Great.. Thanks"
"Apple",1,"Awful so disappointed only had for 5 months and it just died nothing absolutely nothing black screen"
"Apple",5,"Very nice!!!"
"Apple",5,"It took 2 days to get here. I'm really happy with the phone."
"Apple",3,"I got this phone and according to the listing on here it went through straight talk and went i got the phone it was verizon"
"Apple",4,"Bought this very inexpensive phone for a teenager who loves it. Had a difficult time getting it activated following instructions from seller. Happy with product, but very disappointed with seller. Would not buy from this seller again."
"Apple",5,"Bought this used however it didn't have a scratch on it wonderful deal! Daughter loves it!"
"Apple",4,"great"
"Apple",4,"came on early looks great brand new even came with the iphone box works great with the prepaid company. works well the battery doesn't stay charged for many then a couple hours but thats not a big deal because it charges really fast, at first i was a little worried about getting this phone due to some of the comments but i like it an i m happy i got it. i would say its okay to buy if your looking for a phone"
"Apple",5,"loved it"
"Apple",5,"Great phone had no problems with it"
"Apple",4,"Phone connected to straight talk easily, it comes with step by step directions for getting connected and arrived on time exactly what I expected. The only reason I did not rate 5 stars is because my phone tries to face time in the middle of phone calls often. At first I thought I must be hitting the screen on the side of my face but it does it when on speaker and untouched as well. Good product great seller."
"Apple",5,"I'm loving my new phone. I received it 3 business days after placing my order. An instructional step by step sheet was included which made set up with straight talk an absolute breeze!!! As instructed, a $6.99 one time net work fee was charged by straight talk. No problem. It took maybe 30 minutes for the straighttalk rep to talk me through simply because I speak ""redneck"" so I had to understand him. My phone came in it's own box and everything is fine. The phone does everything I need it to do and yes, I recommend it and would definitely buy it again. Thanks!!"
"Apple",1,"This was advertised as a phone to use for straight talk wireless...I only wanted that and to get away from Verizon wireless..instead the straight talk ready to activate phone is in fact a Verizon only phone. Totally lied and misled me. I am irate to say the LEAST!!!"
"Apple",5,"True to what is said. Works perfect on straightalk."
"Apple",5,"Everything seems to be working. Bought this item as used, but it looks new!! very nice phone."
"Apple",5,"Śo awesome Iove it is used but looks and feel new 😍😍😍😄"
"Apple",5,"The phone works great and I love it !!!"
"Apple",5,"fantastic good phone"
"Apple",5,"Love the phone, I recommend buying!"
"Apple",5,"Fast delivery of a great product! 👍👍👍"
"Apple",5,"My godson 16 year old godson loves this phone. This was his Christmas gift from me."
"Apple",5,"Love it"
"Apple",5,"Love this phone - got here quicker than stated. I did have an issue with first phone but the company stuck with me and made sure I got a replacement - I highly recommend this product."
"Apple",5,"I got my phone and it works great I love it.. Had no problems with it.."
"Apple",1,"The phone was in fine condition but did not work for straight talk as advertised."
"Apple",1,"Had to resell the phone because it wasn't strait talk it was Verizon. wasted a month trying to get it fixed but just broke down and bought one that was actually a strait talk phone instead of haveing to deal with Verizon and strait talk.😠😠😠😠"
"Apple",2,"This did NOT work for Straight Talk for me. I called Straight Talk twice to activate. I was informed it would work in certain areas depending on your zip code. It will not be compatible in all areas. The cell I received happen to have a defect so I needed to return it anyways. Contacted seller and as of now I have emailed back and forth a few times. The seller keeps informing me instructions stating that it does work with Straight Talk, not to go to Walmart but to call Straight Talk ( I did this twice now) to read the Rep the instructions ( I did this also) at this point I'm just frustrated. I wish it worked but I can't MAKE straight talk activate it if they keep telling me it's not compatible!"
"Apple",3,"Took me 4 hours to set up... That's because everyone who works at straight talk is Indian and they can't understand...I finally got someone who was easy to understand 4 hour later...it's an okay phone it's kinda slow , and it charged all night and was on 78% when I woke up...which I don't understand because my old phone would be fully charged in the morning.. I'm gonna use it for awhile if I still don't like it I'll just go back to my bigger phone"
"Apple",5,"I love this phone it works better than my other one"
"Apple",5,"This phone is the best I got it on the mail today"
"Apple",3,"I like it but the battery dies pretty. Quickly... But if not for that I would give not five stars"
"Apple",5,"100% satisfied"
"Apple",4,"Does work with straight talk! But the charger that came with it did not work so I had to buy a new one, but that's not to big of a deal, satisfied!"
"Apple",1,"Phone did not match description, It had no place for a sim card like a regular iphone should, I tried to activate it and found out it was NOT a straight talk phone, right from the straight talk people. It took a long time to get my refund after a lot of unnecessary communications. Very disappointed and frustrated."
"Apple",4,"Awesome for being a refurbished 4. Came within a week (though my order tracker says the delivery date is in April lol)Getting myself a 5 to try to catch up technologically, but this is exactly as described and works perfectly."
"Apple",4,"Arrived quickly. Bought this a while back, and my experience with this phone it okay, kind of weird didn't have a sim card slot even though it said it would, but whatever. A good small phone that'll do the job, and a good price."
"Apple",5,"Bought for my daughter and she LOVES it! Thank you!"
"Apple",5,"Great phone. Only little confusion to get activated. Will be purchasing my son in next few months"
"Apple",2,"The cord that came with my phone didn't work . I also recently discovered that the speaker does not work . So my rating for this phone isn't good ."
"Apple",5,"Works awesome with straightalk"
"Apple",4,"Great phone for straight talk. Easy to use"
"Apple",5,"very nice phone,takes nice photos also"
"Apple",1,"It did not work, I could not get it to connect to wifi, and numerous other issues. After over 50 trys , I gave up and sent it back. I had to pay 20$ for restock fee ( which was taken from my purchase)."
"Apple",3,"one speaker of phone dose not work"
"Apple",5,"I love my phone, thanks a lot."
"Apple",1,"had to return , saller should know that it doesn't work anywhere in Alaska. Details?"
"Apple",4,"I like the phone but I'm limited on a lot of things with this phone compared to my old android. Couldn't Bluetooth my photos over and it doesn't let me download pictures."
"Apple",5,"Got it for someone else, they love it!"
"Apple",5,"The iPhone 4 works just perfectly. Took me sometime to set it up with straight talk but other than that this phone works just like any other."
"Apple",5,"I love it, came a lot sooner then expected:)"
"Apple",5,"bought for a friend ...she loves it"

"Apple",4,"this is a great phone! its comes new! I only have one reason to give this 4 stars instead of five bc I had a tiny problem that im sure the seller will fix! buy this phone its great!:)"
"Apple",5,"Everything was delivered so quickly and perfect condition!! My only advice to you (for those of us who are NOT tech smart) is when including instructions on how to register the phone for straight talk, explain that the ""access code"" is replacing the ""meid"" number b/c they asked me for that meid number SO many times & I went round & round with them for over an hour before I figured that one out!! Ha! Not tech smart!! But you give great quality service & product!"
"Apple",4,"Surprisingly nice phone. Usually a little heasitant about buying a phone online but have had zero issues in the last month I've had it."
"Apple",5,"Bought three of these phones for me and my girls and they are awesome!! Very easy to use instructions and very helpful company. Very happy:)"
"Apple",5,"Bought this for my hubby for Christmas. I ordered a bit too late and he didn't get it for Christmas day but he was just happy to get his own phone. And he is very pleasantly surprised at how much he loves his iPhone."
"Apple",1,"could not access phone with straight talk had to buy a new phone this was not what the person said it was"
"Apple",5,"Veary good phone and did not take long to get it and can't say any thang bad about the I phone works great"

"Apple",1,"Three days after I got the ohone, the display sdreen went put. the phne still worked, but you could not see the screen. After I tried many ways to get it to work with no sucess, I slamed the back of the phone with my hand. behold, the screen came on. I'm crossing my fingers!!!!"
"Apple",1,"I bought this phone with the notion of using it for straight talk ( on a budget ) and had that typed in for the search. When I came across this phone I looked thru the detailes and it said it was compatible for straight talk. I recieved the phone on time and I good condition. But the phone is locked to Verizon! It's a model A1349 which can only be used for Verizon. I've had contact with the seller since and have not recieved a return label or a refund. Would not recommend unless u like headaches and handing out hundreds of dollars for something ur not gonna be able to use"
"Apple",5,"I would highly recommend this purchase, becasue the phone is really affordable and cheap for an iPhone and my phone came in a great condition ! It also came in a VERY short amount of time. Love my new phone and I am extremely satisfied. Thank you Reza !"
"Apple",4,"What kind of SIM card do I need to get for this phone? I am extremely excitied to recieve my new phone!"
"Apple",5,"When i recieveed my phone, way ahead of the exspected delivery date, The seller ""sikksounds"" had given me a free upgrade to a 16gb, which was great and much appreciated. The phone was in almost perfect condition, and came with all the acsessories. I was very satisfied with the phone, but ultimatley had to return it do to straight talk not letting me activate it in my area, but Andy was extremly understang and immeadatly refunded me my money and gave me a return label within the hour i originally contacted him. I would highly reccomend him for his great service!"
"Apple",4,"Ordered this iPhone as a replacement phone for samsung captivate. Although there were a few mistakes made I am enjoying my new phone (day 1). The seller was very helpful and very courteous and helped solve any issues I had! Good customer service! Completely recommend."

"Apple",5,"The kids love them"
"Apple",5,"Love"
"Apple",4,"Works ascot should I love it. Looks sharp too."
"Apple",5,"Let me start off by saying this phone does in fact work with straight talk. I was also kind of skeptical of it too but I was reassured by the seller (iconverwireless) that it would work with straight talk. Matt, the one I contacted was so helpful. The phone arrived in 3 days and in great condition. It did not include Apple stickers or earbuds but I didn't want any, so no loss. We got the phone activated in less than 4 min. No joke. This phone was amazing, and DOES work with straight talk. Totally recommend. 😀"
"Apple",4,"nice"

"Apple",5,"Fast shippping And the phone was brand new in the box I will be oredering From Tokin again thumbs up....... =)"
"Apple",5,"Received the phone faster that expected and that was a nice surprise. The only glitch I had was that it is a Verizon phone and there was no way to use Straight Talk. Ended up going with Verizon, which is the same price, but not as much data monthly. I think I read you need an activation card from Straight Talk to make it work, but not that big of a deal for me. Love my new iPhone!!"
"Apple",1,"Do not but from seller GO Wireless. This phone isn't worth the materials it's made of. To start, it took over 24 hrs just to charge it to 50%, and then after two days, the battery stopped accepting a charge all together and the phone died completely. I'm in the process of contacting the seller. :( Now I'm phoneless and going through all of the necessary steps to return it. GO Wireless replaced the phone for free, but the ""new"" phone has a touch screen that doesn't work properly on the right side. I couldn't even type in my Wi-Fi password because I couldn't select the letters I needed due to the dysfunctional touch screen. Worst product ever. Please, save yourself the trouble and don't buy this product from GO Wireless."
"Apple",5,"The phone was delivered quickly. We have experienced no problems and are very happy with the purchase."
"Apple",1,"Was not for straight talk. It was for Verizon so I had to call straight talk and buy a kit to transfer it to straight talk. The kit was only 6.99 but it wasn't something I expected to spend the extra money on. Please check your phones before saying they are with a company. Overall though, I love the phone and the shipping was fast!"
"Apple",1,"i was so excited for this but straight talk is saying its NOT compatible with them so now im stuck with phone and the $45 card.. help? i don't know what to do"
"Apple",5,"Excellent item and fast shipping"
"Apple",5,"Looks great works great"
"Apple",5,"I love it 5 start I will buy again"
"Apple",5,"It does work with straight talk! And came in early! Very happy."
"Apple",4,"I like this phone, I was skeptical because of reviews saying it couldn't be connected to Straight talk, but I live in California and had no trouble at all, got my same number and everything. I just had to pay $6.99 to get the network access code and that was it! I do see the battery goes kinda fast and sometimes the phone doesn't seem to like the charger(sometimes its goes on and off charge, but it does charge), but other than that it's great!"
"Apple",4,"I thought the phone was in excellent condition when I purchased it, I didn't have any problems getting it setup. It was totally easy from start to finish. My son loves his new iphone."
"Apple",4,"good"
"Apple",3,"Happy with the phone"
"Apple",1,"Recieved today... was NOT Straight Talk applicable? Thanks for ABSOLUTELY NOTHING! Disappointed and Ripped Off!"
"Apple",3,"Wanted it for use with Straight Talk, but it wasn't compatible. I was unable to get it to work at all. This one at least was unlocked so even though I can't use it as a phone, I can use it as a backup Ipod."
"Apple",2,"Really nice phone. Should have checked if it could be used in area first. Said it was for straight talk but couldn't use it for any of the companies in the area."
"Apple",5,"Been a great little phone , nothing fancy but face time works great calls and texts"
"Apple",3,"I had the iphone 4 a few years ago and loved it so i bought it again but i didnt know it could not update to ios 8 so i couldnt download some popular apps like instagram and twitter and some others. I should have bought the iphone 4s"
"Apple",1,"product was posted as being for straight talk but when i tried to activate it. i was informed by straight talk. that it was a ""locked"" verizon phone, i resold it on E bay for half what i paid for it and then ordered a phone through straight talk to avoid anymore hassle"
"Apple",5,"Been using it for a year now. No problems so far! :-)This is honestly a great phone :-)"
"Apple",5,"Works great love it!"
"Apple",1,"Worst phone ever runs on 3g"
"Apple",3,"It works good but I had to pay for a plan and I was told there was no plan"
"Apple",5,"GOOD PHONE.."
"Apple",4,"Phone works great, but software is too old for most apps to work."
"Apple",1,"Worst information that was provided"
"Apple",1,"I could not get turned on thru my phone carrier so I waste my money"
"Apple",1,"Horrible don't order from these people"
"Apple",5,"goods"
"Apple",5,"A few reviews said getting this product was a disappointing risk, but I disagree. I love this phone and it charges great! I'm a little upset I can't update the phone past 7.1.2 because some apps need 8.0 or newer, but for texting, calling, web and some apps, it's great! My first apple phone, and definitely not my last!!!"
"Apple",1,"3g is painfully slow."
"Apple",1,"Didnt like it the lock button was sticky when i first got it cant return it because i droped it an screen cracked.it wont lock the button dont work anymore."
"Apple",1,"The phone wouldnt charge.. It was broke from the beginning, a waste of money, and a very dissatisfied customer"
"Apple",1,"do not buy this if you want to use straight talk. The description is a lie!!!!!!"
"Apple",5,"It a good phone ."
"Apple",1,"My left speaker is not working also when I plug it in it says accessorie not supported"
"Apple",4,"It was a nice phone, but returned it. It wouldn't charge. I needed a phone right away and ordered another one."
"Apple",3,"i cant get i setup with straight talk but a clean iphone indeed"
"Apple",5,"Great phone for price"
"Apple",5,"My first IPhone. Thought I'd start simple. No regrets. Love the thing. I'm hooked. Would recommend for first time IPHONE user."
"Apple",5,"Very happy,working like new,no problem"
"Apple",4,"iPhone came in good condition, had problems connecting it with straight talk, but contacted customer service and was able to connect in min, but it cost about 5 dollars with bring your phone through straight talk. It came with really cheap headphones, do not recommend them, overall it was a good deal."
"Apple",2,"great item, will purchase again!!!v"
"Apple",5,"I really like this purchase it was a great buy...everything is perfect with this product."
"Apple",5,"Very satisfied with my purchase! I ordered the refurbished version from a seller New York it arrived in less than a week and all I had to do was call straight talk and pay 8$ to get my number transferred with my minutes and in less than 5 minutes I was using my IPhone... I love this phone"
"Apple",3,"For being a refurbished phone I say this phone is great. I haven't put minutes on it yet but will be soon. Wanted to get to know the phone 1st since it is my 1st iPhone. So far no problems with it expect when I use certain apps it drains my battery."
"Apple",1,"I like the iPhone but I order a iPhone 4 not a iPhone 3 but other wise it was good and I want straight talk phone not Verizon ."
"Apple",5,"Had no problem whatsoever adding it to a pre-existing straight talk account. it works perfectly. thanks."
"Apple",1,"I'm very disappointed in this apple."
"Apple",3,"It was ok"
"Apple",5,"had fears of a used cell phone but love this one, straight talk set it up for us in just a few mins."
"Apple",5,"I love this product !! Works perfectly! Although I did have a bit of trouble setting it up with straight talk it wasn't the phones issue it was the straight talk company itself. When I tried to to activate it online 5 times within a 2 days period the website told me something different each time ,but I eventually called the straight talk hot line and I explained my situation and she fixed it within 10 minutes and if anyone tells you your issue is that it's with verizon don't listen to them because straight talk uses the verizon towers ,but overall I can't complain I even went to a different state with the phone and had excellent service! I also like how sturdy it is lol I've dropped it many times and it hasn't scratched or cracked at all"
"Apple",1,"I received the phone and it wasn't straighttalk. I had to sit on the phone with straighttalk for an hour to pay a network fee of 6.99. Now. Two hours later. I am still sitting here waiting for it to be activated. And when I call the number it tell me it's unable to do it. I am severely irritated with this product n"
"Apple",5,"Great product I love this phone works with straight talk"
"Apple",3,"For the price not worth it. Makes a loud screeching noise during conversation speaker not loud enough"
"Apple",5,"Got here fast, nice, new, and very helpful directions on how to set up with straight talk included. REALLY WORKS WITH STRAIGHT TALK. No problems getting it going. Love the phone. Very satisfied, even with it being a 6 yr old phone. Very much worth the small price you pay!"
"Apple",5,"Bought it for my daughter and she enjoys it."
"Apple",5,"Excellent"
"Apple",3,"The phone is great. The problem is the product description. I bought this phone thinking it was for straight talk (product description). I went to the store. Purchased the card and then tried to activate the phone. I was on the phone for an hour with straight talk. They kept telling me they couldn't identify the phone. They couldn't activate it, nothing. As I'm on the phone with them I am looking at the about section for the phone and that's when I see Carrier: Verizon. My phone was not for straight talk. It was for Verizon. After reading more and more reviews from others about this phone I saw that some people were having the same problem as me. I went onto Verizon and had the phone activated in ten minutes. Phone is great. Came with charger and ear buds. Just be sure to check the carrier listed on the phone."
"Apple",5,"Shopping was very quick. Everything came with it in box and all. Brand new phone and had no problem with setting it up with Straight Talk. I love it. The only thing is that I didn't know so that's my fault is you have to pay $6.99 for the access code basically to activate it unless you buy your own activation set up kit."
"Apple",5,"I was impressed with the condition of the phone. It didn't even look like it was ever used. My daughter was very happy with the phone. Thank you."
"Apple",5,"this is good phone, and good merchant the phone came in perfect condition  and the delivered was quick.. I like it a lot... I am a satisfied costumer..good thanks"
"Apple",4,"The phone itself was dusty inside the box. The phone was unscratched and we were able to get it activated after buying an activation package. It runs a but slower than expected which is why I gave 4 out of 5 stars."
"Apple",5,"man i order this on December 29, 2015 and it said it will be arriving Janurary 5-8 but it came Janurary 2,2016 and it works came with charger only think wrong with it is that it comes dead i made sure to plug in and see if it works but i recommend it to anyone trying to buy this"
"Apple",5,"Great condition. Thanks."
"Apple",1,"worst phone I ever gotten. I got this phone last year for 250 dollars, now its 150? recently I traded this phone in to verizon.I had an old iPhone 4 when I came in and now I came out with an iPhone 6s for cheap!"
"Apple",5,"It was labeled used/good but was like new :)"
"Apple",5,"Bought this for my husband and was extremely pleased!!!"
"Apple",5,"the item came faster then excepted. And easy to set up."
"Apple",5,"My grandson was absolutely thrilled with this gift. This is all he wanted for Christmas but I knew I couldn't afford a brand new one.When I saw this one, and the price, I couldn't believe that it was in such good shape (from the picture). Then when it arrived, I found that it was brand new, never been activated, or even had the plastic film taken off the screen............and I paid less than $70 for it. I went back & re-read the description of how Amazon classes ""new, used, good"" and although this one was listed as ""used"", the only thing missing was the original box but for a savings I got, the box was irrelevant. I gave him his Christmas present early to make sure everything was ok with it, and it was, so he is one happy kid."
"Apple",1,"You cannot get this phone networking card for this phone with straight talk will not work"
"Apple",5,"You cannot beat an iPhone on Straighttalk. The only draw back. No service for WiFI hotspot. Othet than that great phone, great service."
"Apple",4,"Ok"
"Apple",4,"Came unopened,brand new. Which is something I was kinda worried about. Works wonderfully. Has a glitche,but what phone doesn't? Nothing that's unmanageable. Other than that great buy!"
"Apple",5,"Very good stuff I love it"
"Apple",4,"Great Iphone 4 Great Condition Works Well, I Love it Thanks -Chinks"
"Apple",1,"Is NOT A STTAIGHTTALK PHONE FOR VERIZON ONLY"
"Apple",4,"it was good"
"Apple",3,"Decent but there are some serious errors in its shippment and description. pros: no damage, came in box (sealed) , with charger and headphones. cons: its meant to be used for a verizon phone only, and cannot be converted to straight talk (regular sim card slots were not built in), and it came with no phone card like promised and described. overall: good phone and i like it, but it simply wasnt what i ordered! blame: the sellers of the phone (ship fast tech llc) who did not deliver what they promised in their ad, used false advertising, and have not altered it even after similiar or more critical reviews refered to the straight talk dilemma. if u want striaght talk, dotn buy this, if you dotn care and just want an iphone 4, go ahead, but watch out, you might not be a lucky as me."
"Apple",1,"This would have been a cool phone but there was a big problem for me ... the battery life was not good however seller I bought from which wAs iconvertwireless the owner Matt was absolutely so courteous and professional when I wanted a return he issued a full refund just as he told me he would I wouldn't recommend the phone but definitely recommend iconvertwireless very good seller ."
"Apple",5,"No issue"
"Apple",4,"""Sikksound "" the seller sent it in almost new condition it arrived quickly and works good my only complaint is that one speaker doesent work"
"Apple",5,"We are very satisfied with the phone, it has worked better than expected. We were told it would work in some area codes in our area, but so far it has worked for us. Would recommend this phone and the no contract plan."
"Apple",4,"I love the phone, It was a great buy. It came really fast in the mail, way sooner than expected. There was only one problem with the purchase of my items. The problem was that the charger that came with the phone easily came unravled at the end of it. It still works but its barely hanging on and i doubt it will last much longer."
"Apple",5,"Omg this phone has exceeded my expectations and I'm actually using it right now to write this review. Beautiful and works perfectly. Battery life is incredible. I love my new phone!!!!"
"Apple",5,"Awesome phone!"
"Apple",5,"I love it!"
"Apple",5,"The phone is great everything working just fine."
"Apple",5,"I love my iPhone 4! I got my phone from iconvertwiress and it came in the mail yesterday. I got 2 one for my husband and the other for me. Both were in excellet condition. It was so easy to set up. It was aready active with straight talk all I had to do was transfer everything over. It took only about 10 minutes and then I was able to use my new phone. I would definitely purchase from these people again."
"Apple",1,"I hope I get the phone in good condition"
"Apple",1,"Ordered this for my sons birthday thinking it would work on straight Talk but it don't was really disappointed . The advertising was false don't recommend this for a gd buy"
"Apple",5,"Really good condition, contract-free iPhone that lived up to the seller’s description. It was an easy set up, everything needed was included in the package, and it was really fast shipping. I would honestly rate this purchase 5 stars not only because I love the phone, but because all too often you don’t get everything you expected in a purchase, but this time I did. I don’t think I’ve ever purchased and activated a phone so smoothly before.(Yeah this review might sound too good to be true, but I don’t post reviews very often. This is saying something!)=)"
"Apple",5,"This iPhone is amazing! I love it! It does I'm fact work with straight talk. You juts have to go on the straight talk website and type in the code that's found under about in your settings. It works! Thank you guys! Five Stars!"
"Apple",5,"It was what I was looking for in a Phone thanks for the music. I was Happy with the phone."
"Apple",5,"Phone was in near perfect shape and it came with accessories. Phone works great. If your looking for a phone I would recommend this place."
"Apple",5,"they arived in time in APO adress-Afghanistan its nice to buy used iphones when they are in good care,without problems,working perfect,recived as described"
"Apple",2,"The phone had been opened. 3 Screws missing along with wifi connector clip and antenna clip under battery connector miss placed. Result little wifi connect ability. Hidden damage."
"Apple",1,"I bought because It said that It was unlocked but It wasn't. Now I am in my country, Ecuador and It doesn't work so it is not open to use it worldwide.DON'T BELIEVE THIS GUY !"
"Apple",5,"this product seems to be brand new have no problems with the phone at all no scratches or dents very happy with it"
"Apple",1,"If everything you ship is like this than i will advise everybody to not buy from you. I got this phone and about a day after it started to break. The third day one of the speakers went out, the next the lock button got stuck and no longer works. now the home button barely works, i have to push certain areas for it to even respond. Im pretty sure the rest of this phone is going to fail at some point, thanks for wasting my money"
"Apple",5,"When I received this iphone 4 it was in great condition, but it somehow slipped through the cracks and the unlock and updated os was not completed. I found this out when I tried to have a prepaid service turned on and shelled out $60 for a chip that was nonrefundable. I was furious, I expected the worst to try and resolve this issue, but when I emailed him on Friday night about 6 pm western time he responded within 20 minutes. He apologized profusely and talked me through how to finish the unlock and update til 11:30. then when I installed my new chip it works fine and has been fine ever since I would definitely recommend and buy from this seller again. Things happen and he stood behind his product well past regular business hours."
"Apple",1,"Apple iPhone 4 16GB (Black) - VerizonI feel really stupid. I should have read all the reviews about Wireovia. Like so many others the home button is locked and the only way I can move from app to app is to turn the phone off and on. I am surprised that Amazon is still allowing them to sell on their site."
"Apple",1,"I bought this phone NEW, when I opened the box it did not look new at all. I bought this phone and a straight talk sim card, so a few days of Me having this phone I was having an issue sending and receiving picture messages. So I called straight talk and they told Me it was an apple issue. I called Apple and they told Me this phone was not used and belonged to someone in Italy and they had unlocked it and also they noticed the jailbreak which I didn't know about. So they said they couldn't help Me with the issue...So now I am stuck with a phone that can't send out picture messages unless it is another iphone."
"Apple",2,"After several weeks of use my son said the home button stopped working. I told him to make sure everything was working, but the phone part is working"
"Apple",5,"I bought this phone for my Daughter and she is loving it. It was delivered quickly and the condition of the phone was just as was stated. She was able to turn it on and use it right away with absolutely no problems. I would highly recommend purchasing from this seller. He was honest about the product and even added a person thanks in our receipt and was available to us if there was a problem."
"Apple",5,"Easy to answer,simple to use compared to other operating systems. I traded in LG phone and bought my apple on li"
"Apple",5,"I had attempted to write this once before, but really did not know what to say. I have to say that the seller of this product, was excellent. they said that it would be fast delivery, and it was, there were only minor cosmetic markings on the face of the phone but you would have to look really hard to find them. At first I was very skeptical about buying a used phone. I don't think that would be a fear for me now. I would defiantly order from this seller again with no hesitation.they were true with what they advertized. I was new to iPhone so I really did not know much about them. I received the phone and was able to begin operations immediately. I would and have recommended this family, friends, and people on the job.Thanks to Amazon and Ideals,A very satisfied customer ."
"Apple",1,"I sent back the iPHONE 4 one month ago because it does not respond when you push the bottom button to cancel or go back some of the time. I haven't received refund yet. What's going on? Please issue refund as soon as possible. Thank you."
"Apple",3,"Worked fine for 6 weeks but now screen is not displaying part of the top most left corner. Still functional, but annoying...."
"Apple",5,"I am so pleased with this purchase! Phone is in excellent condition as described and shipping was fast! This was one of the best purchases i've made and I'm so glad it was with bestDeals!! Thank you so much....absolutely no regrets and I will continue to buy merchandise from them!"
"Apple",5,"Phone came in perfect condition, also came unlocked as promised(I'm writing this straight from the iPhone on straight talk) very satisfied."
"Apple",1,"soon u will be in prison i already contacted general attorney just remember where ever you hide we can always find you  i hope u scared of what your doing i think ur not believing of bad karma just remember bad karma its always back to you"
"Apple",5,"This was a used item but was in excellent condition. It was factory unlocked as promised. Just had to insert a micro sim card and we were up and running with our Tmobile account. The charger included did not work but we had an extra charger so it wasn't a problem."
"Apple",1,"At first I like the delivery it was fast, but after I open the box the iPhone was dirty I need to clean it first. It is color white and some parts are still dirty I don't know? What to use in cleaning that particular area it's color tan. I just really need the phone that's why I did not return it but I will never ever recommend amazon to my friends when it comes to gadgets. Sorry but there should not even dents on it but it has. Please next time you have to make it sure that you have to surpass. The expectations of you customers."
"Apple",4,"I am not so technologically gifted that I wanted an iPhone 5, so the iPhone 4 was the right ticket. It seems more intuitive than other smart phones I've played with. There are lots of pluses and features that I don't even know about yet. I'm embarrassed small children can manage this phone easier than I, but this is going to get me over the top. Not if, but ""when"" I get better at using this phone, I'll get my daughter one."
"Apple",4,"The phone seems to be working very well no problems it had the storage capacity that was in the description looked felt and worked like a brand new phone so I will repost in a few months letting you know if the status remains the same."
"Apple",1,"This phone is a total piece of crap! When I got it, the home button and one of the speakers didn't work. I've dropped another $100 fixing it. Too overpriced for the condition it was in. Never again will I buy from this seller."
"Apple",1,"It wasn’t only a refurbished item instead of unused item. The IPhone 4 I received and sent back is a fraud.On october 17, I spent more than 2 hours at the Genius Bar of Apple Store at 5th Avenue, New York. They recommended me to do a back up first and come back the other day.The following day, 18, in Apple Store at 14th Street, New York, I spent another 2 hours at the Genius Bar just to know 1) that they couldn't just replace the phone because it was out of warranty - it expired two years before, one year after it had been bought by its first owner, in June 2010. So if wanted a replacement I'd have to pay US$ 150 for it - which I accepted; and 2) at the very moment of the transaction, the guy who served me at the shop counter noticed something in the iPhone and asked me to wait. He checked the serial number and found that the iPhone was originally a black one - the one I bought was a white one. He couldn't replace it.They didn't have a new iPhone 4 to sell, and I needed desperately to buy a cell phone because I was leaving the next day to Brazil. I bought an iPhone 5C unlocked for $649 + taxes, as you can see in the annexed file. Total: US$ 706.59.If you want to be fair, please deposit the difference of U$ 266,50 (706,59 - 439,98) I had to pay. I wont charge for the four hours of my vacation I wasted at Apple’s counter, neither for the worry and inconvenience I had with your item .I send alrady several emails and I'm still waiting for an answer. Hope to hear from you soon."
"Apple",1,"This phone is Described as NEW but obviously is not, phone appeared new in factory box. The first phone died after 2 hours, the screen when blank and could not be restarted. The second one worked okay except that the microphone was bad and callers could not hear you, nor could you do a voice recording."
"Apple",5,"Seller was very helpful.Product is working very well.a couple of scratches. One is due to the hard cover which was covering the top of the screen"
"Apple",5,"Decided to upgrade my phone and found this phone available. Works fine and arrived without a problem. Price was acceptable and thee were no issues in the purchase or delivery of the phone."
"Apple",1,"Obviously it's not a NEW phone. There are scratches on the screen. After 1 day, the battery still can not be 100% charged. I returned the phone."
"Apple",5,"everything is said it would be. I've had a bad run with used and restored iPhones in the past so I went for this one and it was worth it"
"Apple",5,"Gracias excelente"
"Apple",5,"great item!"
"Apple",4,"No scratches looks completely new! No problems with it at all it's been working perfectly fine!"
"Apple",5,"bought this phone for my daughters birthday, and the phone looks untouched very clean and so far no problems with it. My daughter is very happy."
"Apple",5,"My granddaughter is very pleased with her Iphone4."
"Apple",5,"I have been using Iphone 4 for 4 years. Have no complaints whatsoever."
"Apple",1,"This phone didn't last 2 months. When I checked to view the return policy, it was only for 30 days. That's not fair. The speaker isn't working and the phone shuts down unexpectedly. I believe this phone was never a new phone!. Buyers beware!"
"Apple",5,"The phone works perfect. My son loved it!!! the shipment is really fast and don't have problem with activating it. Thank you!!! AWESOME!!"
"Apple",1,"One of the speakers is broken from water damage, i learned cause i got it with a broken screen also and when i went to get it fixed they told me why complete waste."
"Apple",2,"It looks so old. I don't expect it look so old like that."
"Apple",3,"Positive items: the wide array of apps."
"Apple",5,"This iPhone has exceeded my expectations. It is so reliable and I have already recommended it to my friends. The voice and other added features are just incredible"
"Apple",3,"I like the product and the time in receiving it. Would recommend to my friends and others. Good to go."
"Apple",5,"excelente vendedor desde venezuela todo perfecto gran telefono sin detalle alguno llego en el tiempo estimado en excelentes condiciones gracias"
"Apple",1,"This phone broke after 5 weeks the microphone quit working and I needed a working phone that day, I had to bring it to Apple, they gave me a new phone for $150, so add this to the $300 I paid for this phone so I got a brand new factory unlocked 32 GB iPhone 4 for $450 which is ok."
"Apple",1,"Purchased I Phone 4 32 GB Factory Unlocked everything was working well the first day! Product came in the mail over to Italy where I am stationed in 5 days! Which is real fast! While I was sleeping Voice Control started to come on and off by itself and not to mention the home button stops working as well! I tried to to restore it but the phone keeps going back to recovery mode!"
"Apple",1,"I received yesterday, when I installed the simm (wich is working on other unlocked iphone 4 32gb), I realized that it is not unlocked, because the simm is invalid. I need as urgent to solve this problem. Please help me !!!!!"
"Apple",5,"very good a excelent service very conditions una manera muy segura para este tipo de mercadeo lo seguire usando desde venezuela"

Apple shows why she's the market leader with this product."
"Apple",5,"AWESOME phone! Absolutely love it. Came to me brand new in mint condition. Too expensive, but I had to indulge."
"Apple",5,"0 complainsthe iphone came to me brand new....and im using it in Caracas Venezuela, without any trouble!!!!!I think, these models come from europe, cause the battery charger, but these people incorporates an adaptor plug!!!"
"Apple",4,"I love my iPhone even though I have not been able to use it. I've always loved iPhone and was waiting patiently to get one. Also bought the SIM cutter and cut my Digicel Sim, however it does not work with the iphone. I called APPLE and they said a cut SIM will NOT work, I'll HAVE TO get a micro sim, as the connections are different. FOR THIS, APPLE LOSES 1 STAR because now I have to wait another day and spend some money with another network to get a micro sim in order to use my phone - Boo!Until then, it's back to my faithful iTouch.. BTW, my cut sim is back in my Nokia and working fine, so it wasn't damaged during the cut. Learn from my misinformation and don't waste ur $ on a Micro SIM Cutter, Converter with 2 SIM adapters UNTIL you verify a cut SIM will work with the SIM provider and others on the network.One-day shipping was great. Got all my items securely packaged and intact. Thanks Amazon."
"Apple",1,"I bought this Iphone form SJohnson236, and they send me locked Iphone with Gevey Adapter and ATT Software, I returned it the same day, and I got the refund, Thanks to Amazon"

"Apple",5,"Been using this phone for like six months now. Best cell buy I've made in years. I have watched its price on Amazon and the price keeps going up from when I made my purchase... If it goes back down I may consider purchasing an extra on one day"
"Apple",5,"Absoutley wonderful quick service no problems!!!"
"Apple",5,"As all Apple products, it's my number one choice. It's very convenient, easy to use, and works great. It has everything I need in a phone, a personal planner device, entertainment, and anything else you can think of, it's got it all."
"Apple",5,"I was a little disappointed at the beginning, thinking I was getting a 4S. But when I checked back on the item description, I realized that it was a 4 the whole time- I just didn't read it well.Either way, I have enjoyed the 32gb of space, enabling me to put more music on my phone.I was able to unlock this phone easily with At&t."
"Apple",1,"Este telefono le funciona muy mal su cámara. Las fotos me salen borrosas, no sirve su camara frontal. no hace el cambio y se queda trancado. Parece a simple vista nuevo, pero estoy segura que es remanufacturado ya que tiene rayones en el boton de superior encendido. no trajo calcomanias, no trajo la llave para la sim card. su plastico protector fue removido y estaba sucio con huellas dactilares por todos lados... y lo compre en estatus de NUEVO Fui estafado por esta gente. NO RECOMENDADO.This phone will work very badly their camera. The photos came out blurry me, front camera is wrong, does not change . Looks new, but I'm sure it's rebuilt as it has scratches on the top button on. I brought status new, did not bring the key for the sim card. its protective plastic was removed and put , is dirty with fingerprints... . I scammed by these people. NOT RECOMMENDED...."
"Apple",4,"Looks great and is easy to use and update the software, but you have to be careful how you hold it or you attenuate the antenna and don't get much signal."
"Apple",4,"the iphone is perfect , just who buy the phone has to make sure the storage capacity of the phone. series of iphone 4 are all the same from outside but the capacity of the storage could be 8 GB or 16 GB AND or 32 GB. make sure and ask the seller about this, and TAKE CONSIDERATION I PHONE 4 HAS A NO CAPABILITY OF 4G ( FAST INTERNET BROWSING.)THE REST ARE PERFECT ."
"Apple",5,"I got this for my husband fr our anniversary and he absolutely loves it, did have alittle issue with the ring volume but had shut the phone off and turned it back on and it fixed the issue now it's been great."
"Apple",5,"All good pretty fast shipping. Signature is required be aware! I didn't know this! I was able to intercept talking to the postmaster. But that's a case by case deal, you may not be able to do that.As the phone goes perfect no complaints at all. Memory was wiped, old non functioning sim in, but was a plus as I used it to cut my normal sim to size. Normal full case wear. No major scratches. If any small I didn't pay any attention as this phone is for work but I don't notice any day to day so I would so none or minimal. Came with aftermarket charger that was a multi charger, another plus! The down side of that it is not compatible with data exchange. And it had the OEM wall charger. Perfect! Didn't expect less or more!"
"Apple",5,"I got an iphone quickly and in good condition. It looks and feels like new and I have had no problems with it yet."
"Apple",1,"I received my order a couple days ago. To be honest, its not what I hoped. Most of the time when I make or receive a call, I hear nothing on the other end. Sometimes the whole thing just goes black, despite having an adequate amount of battery life on it. I am seriously considering sending this back for a refund. I am quite disappointed."
"Apple",5,"here in guam , works perfect ,not any problems to activated, , able to work with any sms card and any region, able to download anything , this works fine!! love it"
"Apple",5,"item is the same as described. i'm very satisfied. deliver even on Christmas holidays, which surprise me. full points to me!!!"
"Apple",4,"Very good phone and well maintained. Except for one issue i.e. back button was not quickly responding other things were near perfect."

"Apple",5,"The phone is cool and easy to use. The number of apps is amazing. It is a real personal assistant. My life in full view."
"Apple",5,"Had a bit of an issue at first. Apparently i had to connect it to itunes before using my new sim. Seller was very responsive. I am very happy with my product..Excellent condition with everything in place. will do business with this seller over and over again.Thumbs up!"
"Apple",5,"Amazing service, real fast deliver and the company it's really interested in the client. I'm very happy with the product and with Wireovia."
"Apple",1,"Iphone that I bought is broken ( the round button in the middle) and locked. - I read in my order - Factory unlocked - and I don't understand."
"Apple",1,"I sent the phone to Vietnam. After using the phone, my borhter figured out that the charger and the speaker didn't work, it was a broken phone."
"Apple",1,"I ordered for Apple iPhone 4 32GB (factory unlocked)- refurbished. The piece looks good to see. But the home is not functioning. I am totally disappointed with the seller. I dont know what to do now."
"Apple",5,"this is used and is in great condition, came with earphone and wall charger and cord. now its the test of putting the sim (micro) {didnt check it would be a problem}in and seeing that it works great. there are very minor scratches on the side but it can be covered by a case."
"Apple",5,"Haw mathe"
"Apple",4,"Very good Excellent .. what I wanted the complete packageI like"
"Apple",2,"seem refubricated not authentic."
"Apple",5,"looked almost new, barely visible scratches, front and back looks when you get it from store looks new and it works great thank you so much"
"Apple",5,"Good quality, factory sealed."
"Apple",1,"Simply put, this phone didn't work for more than two weeks."
"Apple",3,"Bought the phone from RnD Outlet - 'New' from Amazon. Recieved the phone and took it to an Apple store to give it a check over. Unsurprising the phone is not New. It was Sold in a Best Buy in 2010 (thanks to the apple store guys for checking it for me). It has no warranty, obviously because it is not new but at least the internal parts are all legitimate apple components. The plastic screen protectors have been removed and put back on again - you can tell because there are specks of dirt or grit all over it (another point to it being second hand). On the plus side it does indeed appear to be Unlocked. Not going to return it, it looks in good enough condition. Hopefully it is not going to die in the first few months."
"Apple",1,"Item not as described. I returned it."
"Apple",5,"It was a great purchase everything works perfect .. Thanks"
"Apple",4,"I'm having to downgrade from my 4S while it gets fixed and I miss my 4S. This camera is significantly worse than in the 4S."
"Apple",5,"Excellent coondition"
"Apple",4,"Plenty of storage her preteen selfies, camera is just ok though."
"Apple",5,"bought it as a present for my friend. she is happy."
"Apple",5,"excellent"
"Apple",4,"Excelent Product"
"Apple",1,"They sold it as a new phone but at day 40 it stopped working. The official Apple service confirmed that the iphone was not new, but rearmed with parts from other phones and that several of them were defective.It is a shame that mislead buyers this way. Do not buy this kind of phone."
"Apple",5,"llego en excelentes condiciones a venezuela, es liberado, funciona con digitel movistar y movilnet, tal cual lo describian en la paginaarrived in excellent condition Venezuela, is released, works with movistar and movilnet digitel, described it as such on page"
"Apple",1,"This Iphone is on IOS 7.02 I tried so many time to update to current IOS but it won't work. Also iphone 4 camera is pretty bad I can't video call or record videos clear nor can I take selfies clear its blurry. I was expecting better quality iphone for What I have paid but this is so bad iphone. Very disappointed"
"Apple",5,"excellent"
"Apple",5,"Really unlocked, I just put in my sim card and activated using iTunes."
"Apple",5,"I had to return it, because it would not work with Tracfone. It did not have cdma protocol required by Tracfone. The phone itself was in perfect condition, and I hated to part with it."
"Apple",5,"Great Iphone good price don't have a problem it all since I get it"
"Apple",5,"Excelent"
"Apple",5,"The phone was great and as it said in the decription I loved it and it did really save me a trip to the store!!!!!!"
"Apple",5,"Good"
"Apple",5,"I received the product according. It was delivered on time and I am very satisfied. Very good deal!"
"Apple",5,"It came out really good like how it was shown in the images and in the details and what comes with the only one thing was that wen I got it didn't look clean it had some dirt but that wasn't a problem it was easy to take off but other than that 👏"
"Apple",4,"Very good"
"Apple",5,"I bougth it used and works good excellent"
"Apple",5,"love it."
"Apple",1,"The phone shuts itself off even when the battery isn't dead. The battery dies in less than two days even with NO use! It's supposedly new in the box and that appeared to be true but it seems we will have to replace the battery. Not sure if it was a good price after all."
"Apple",5,"I have been using the cell phone for 1 month and it is working very good, i would definetely recomend it , just you need to know that this kind of apple cell phone doesnt work with sprint, verizon and METROPCS but with T Mobile and AT & T works good."
"Apple",5,"Great"
"Apple",5,"This is exactly the Iphone that I need, especially if I will travel international. I love it."
"Apple",5,"Your product is very good I recommend other customer to buy your product you exceed my expectation."
"Apple",2,"The product was fake"
"Apple",2,"As stated in the description, the iPhone had little to no scratches around the phone. Good Job here. After turning it on, here's where the problems began to stir up. Due note that I previously owned a 4s prior and only ordered this one because I loved the phone, lost the phone and thought I'd try another one.Music - I'm a BIG fan of music. With this phone, I am not able to play music, smoothly from Tune In as once before. The issue starts whenever I have Wifi and Carrier service on at the same time. Never a problem with prior.GMaps + Music - Normally, I could listen to music while getting directions from GMaps. With this phone, every turn-by-turn direction causes my music to stop completely and I have to press play in order to start the music again. Never a problem with prior.Home Double-Tap Button - When I attempt to use this feature to navigate through opened apps, it would work about 1 out of 5 tries. Never a problem with prior.Wifi On/Off - Normally, I could turn my wifi on/off, interchangeably, between use with apps and never had a problem; however, apps recognize that the wifi is off and only consider this the designated source for data transfer. To fix, I've had to turn the phone off completely for it to refresh. Never a problem with prior.I am currently in the process of returning this phone, for they have a 90 Day Return policy. Fingers are crossed to see if I get a better replacement.Hopefully this review has helped make a decision for you in the future."
"Apple",5,"A+++"
"Apple",5,"EXCELLENT!"
"Apple",4,"When I bought this phone, it arrived packaged as new, and it worked and looked fine with no problems. However, it came with iOS 7.1.1, which is rather confusing since that OS came out more than 2 years after the phone did. When I questioned the seller about it, they said that it was updated by Apple before they liquidated the phone off to the seller. Since I had specifically wanted it to have the original iOS, I returned it without any hassle.TL;DR - If you want the original iOS, don't buy this phone."
"Apple",1,"Primero lo evalue bien, luego el Telefono empezo a fallar, se quedaba paralizado y el boton de comando dejo de Funcionar. Para mi sorpresa, la Apple me informa que el Telefono ya habia sido reparado antes y que no tiene garantia. Perdi mi dinero!!! No lo compren!First it evaluates fine, then the phone started to fail, he stayed paralyzed and the left command button to Run.To my surprise, Apple informs me that the phone had already been repaired before and has no warranty. I lost my money! Do not buy"
"Apple",1,"The accessories were not original and the phone got damaged a week after I bought it.The customer service was fine though."
"Apple",5,"The product was shipped very fast and arrived in mint conditions excellent service And every thing was exactly as described"
"Apple",1,"When I got the package everything looked all right, but appearances can be deceiving. The USB connector would not accept any cable, just the one shipped inside. This is weird, but I could live with that glitch. Then, 2 weeks later, I noticed that all pictures taken with the front camera got blured and the 5M Pixels back camera had some issues in focusing the image.After 2 months using, I figured some extra bad surprises. The front speaker just went dead 3 days ago, the phone wont ring or produce any sound anymore!!!! Also, there is something wrong with the earphone jack as well, because during song playing we can hear ""pops"" and sudden pauses, just like in vynil players. Moreover, the ""Face Proximity Sensor"" never worked, but I didnt even know it exists, so I could not find out sooner.I took it to an Apple authorized Repair Shop, and to my surprise I was informed that identified that the iPhone was refurbished with a lot of low quality spare parts, including the cameras (back and front ones), and even the front touch screen glass!!I have no doubt that the phone was not ""Very good"" as advertised. Not at all!! I payed a good money for it, and will cost me a lot of extra money to repair it, which is not acceptable."
"Apple",5,"Very Amazing Phone. I can't believe the phone was 32GB and Factory Unlicked and I paid less than a Brand New locked 8Gb phone. This is a much better deal and I returned the new iPhone I ordered previously, Thank You Very Much For This Amazing Deal I Love Amazon And Bayshine Inc.!!! :D heck ya!"
"Apple",5,"Todo muy bien. Me gusto... Fue lo que pedi... llego a tiempo... Excelente, recomendando 100%...Saludos desde Valencia - Venezuela..."
"Apple",4,"All I can say is that this is a great product and works propertly. It arrived on time! I am so happy with this purchase."
"Apple",1,"Check out this facebook page that outlines their shady business practices: [...]The 1-star rating is not for the iphone itself - that would be a 5-star. The 1-star rating is for the seller - WIREOVIAI bought this in March 2012, seeing that it was ""Factory Unlocked by Apple, Never Opened"" and ""New In Shrink-Wrap and Original Packaging"".Just yesterday, a little over 2 months of having the phone, the speaker stopped working so I bring it into Apple, thinking it would be covered under warranty.The apple employee informs me that the iphone was owned and registered in September 2010 - 17 months before I bought this ""new"" iphone.Do not buy ANYTHING from this vendor - WIREOVIA - as you cannot trust the authenticity of what they're selling! What you buy would also not be covered under the manufacturer's warranty if it's older than you think it is. You will just end up with a useless, piece of junk and less several hundred dollars."
"Apple",1,"""I've had the MOST FRUSTRATING experience with this seller in my life. I wouldn't actually leave any stars for them, just had to. This was iPhone 4s box, the bottom of the which was roughly sealed with some dirty paper to cover the real specks, it was blocked and 16 GB instead of 32 GB. Moreover, the seller wouldn't confirm the return of this product despite my 2 emails to them. I do not recommend anyone to do business with this seller ever!!!"""
"Apple",1,"The phone looked good when I opened it but once I started using it I felt that some part of the touch screen is not recognizing the taps. I tried several tests to ensure the problem and finally I went to apple website and follow the resolution but for no improvement. But when I tried to enter the serial no and seek help from Apple specialists system denied saying 'Service coverage expired' where as I am supposed to get 1 yr warranty as per the seller commitment.I looks like although this is claimed as New, it is a replaced/refurbished phone. I felt very sad and need to return it."
"Apple",5,"Good phone and came unlocked"
"Apple",5,"I have had I phones 4s before and feel one of the best models Apple had made. This phone was in great shape while looking so slick. The seller had described the phone exactly the way it is and I'm very happy with my purchase"
"Apple",5,"Very good for 80$"
"Apple",4,"Great, ipod slah phone I like this phone but bought it used unlocked after sprint chose not replace my iPhone 6+ after nearly drowning lol but this phone after having the 5 the 6+ is very good , it just reminds me of ipod the thickness. the service I got from the seller was excellent offering to replace it because the home button was not responding and the flash light didn't work at all. but they suggested to put rubbing alcohol inside it, I didn't but out of no where the home button just started responding the flash light works so now I can say for 80$ the phones worth not paying 250 a month."
"Apple",3,"This phone does not ring at all"
"Apple",5,"Just what the hubs needed."
"Apple",5,"When you have someone who doesn't use their Android phone go to actually using their phone to stay in touch .. that's a good thing"
"Apple",5,"Great chance to get a teens first iPhone!"
"Apple",5,"I loved"
"Apple",3,"Bought two of them. The first one you have to push the middle button a few times to get it to work. The second one was ok, but the volume seems to mess up on it a lot."
"Apple",4,"Nice phone"
"Apple",5,"Brilliant!"
"Apple",5,"excellent"
"Apple",5,"tow years and still working was in perfect shape great"
"Apple",5,"very good"
"Apple",5,"An upgrade for me from a 3GS. So happy I made the move. This phone is wonderful!"
"Apple",1,"The Iphone has minor scratches as described.Unfortunately,the item is not even recognized by my Mac Book Pro ,when I connect to the usb port.When I turn the phone and insert the SIM,it's asking me for a code.The phone is blocked, and locked and I am not able to use it.I am really devastated by this situation."
"Apple",1,"Bought2 of these through Vantage Cellular. The phones were wrapped like new. Looked great. All appeared good. Then little things were noticed. When the screen went black I would see phantom keyboard characters throughout the screen. Similar to how monitors react if the same picture stays on too long and the pixels freeze, same thins with this. I was supposed to get iPhone 4S', not 4's. I even verified the link after purchase and it showed up 4S. Now I had a problem with one phone not turning on and just a black screen. Was told it was the battery, when the phone was opened to replace said battery, low and behold - These aren't real iPhones. So now my ordered iPhone 4S' turn out to be fake iPhone 4's. Will will say 'return them and why did you not send them back right away?' Well, I work overseas and was only home to pick them up for a very short time and returning them was out of the question as the phones were needed when I returned. So how do we fix this? Stay tuned and I will update this as things unfold."
"Apple",5,"Good phone, few issues with software. songs just break or dont play. overall good phone"
"Apple",3,"The phone is in great condition and it works perfectly fine"
"Apple",5,"Got the item out by the time it was suppose to be deliver, the saying you pay what you get for applies here. I was looking so hard for a white iphone and couldn't find one at a reasonable price so I went ahead and order the black one new and I got a white one same gbs and all just the color was different and I was very satisfied with the product no bad experience so far."
"Apple",3,"El equipo llego bien, mas tuve que pagar una alta suma para que lo pudieran desbloquear. no vino desbloqueadode fabrica como decía el anuncio."
"Apple",4,"I like it very much because it is user friendly and I like taking lots of pictures of my family and friends."
"Apple",5,"excellent product. great conditions. just as described on article. works great with my actual carrier here in my country (venezuela)"
"Apple",2,"Seller promised to send unlocked iPhone and sent AT&T locked phone also the screen was broken when I received it.I had to spend more amount to get the screen fixed and now I am struggling to get the iPhone unlocked."
"Apple",5,"Works great, I recomend you to buy reburbished. I have been in the industry for years and I bought this Iphone and it's flawless, fast shipping also. Thank you!"
"Apple",1,"The iphone broke the first day i used it. nothing of the phone was apple original.The iphone was in really bad conditions"
"Apple",2,"The phone itself was great. Until it broke (buttons stopped working) after 3 months. Then I discovered that it was out of warranty, because it was NOT new as stated.This was a ""Fulfillment by Amazon"" seller. It doesn't matter. They are no better than every other seller out there lying about their merchandise. And all Amazon can do is issue a refund."
"Apple",1,"No es confiable este proveedor de celulares, debido a que me fue enviado un celular Iphone como nuevo y fue vendido en el ano 2010 a otra persona, o sea era basura. Fui directamente a una tienda apple en Florida porque nunca sirvio y resulto ser que estaba fuera de garantia. Gracias a apple tengo un iphone"
"Apple",5,"Excelente producto, a pesar de ser usado, esta en muy buenas condiciones tanto estéticamente como funcionalmente. El teléfono es desbloqueado para todo el mundo.!!"
"Apple",5,"I bought this used and i was really nervous because it was such a huge purchase. NEXTDAYTECH really took care of me. props to them. the phone is exactly like they described and they gave me a wall adaptor and charger"
"Apple",1,"The main reason I did not like this product is that from the time it arrived it did not work properly. The docking charging slot was misaligned as were the screws holding it in place. I damaged 2 charging cables trying to use it. When I could finally take it to mu apple dealer he looked up the serial and discovered that it was in reality a used phone purchased over a year before whose warranty was expired. amazon stood by its warranty and refunded me but it was a hassle for me because I live outside the usa and am now trying to get a replacement for my phone. I will never knowingly buy from these folks again"
"Apple",3,"After saving up for several months, I was able to purchase my very first high-end phone. At the time I first bought this phone, it was still considered out of date, but I didn't care. I was very excited to finally have an all in one high quality music player, cell phone, and handheld computer. I remember being most excited, besides the app inclusions, that this product had 32 whole gb to play with. That was more than I'd ever had in my mp3 players/ ipods of the past.Pros-Huge GB Space-App Store-High quality music playback (However, I believe the Sansa line of Mp3 players has a much better quality of music playback and higher volume offering. This is the only one I have found.)-Glass pieces rather than plastic-Unlocked for use with multiple phone servicesCons-Buggy at times-Outdated-Does not support many apps-New OS does not run very smoothly on this-One speaker was busted-Grossly overpriced-You can find an Andriod that improves on this system in every way for a quarter of the priceI have since updated to a less expensive Android phone with expandable memory (LG K700) as even the cheap ones run better OS than this old thing nowadays. For the time though, this piece of software was very innovative and very exciting to have. If you are in the market for a new phone, I would recommend a newer piece of equipment though, rather than springing for this item, even if it is the Apple Store you are looking for. Many apps do not even run on this any longer. A new andriod would save your pocket some dough, and offer you higher improvements."
"Apple",3,"The deal sounds amazing but the home button is really hard to press to work. The heat plate and screws aren't on the inside so you will have poor wifi connection."
"Apple",5,"The quality of the phone was better than expected, I was skeptical at first if it would be actually unlocked, but so far so good."
"Apple",5,"The phone was new in the box withe manufacturer films, totally unlocked, working perfect. The iPhone is the best phone, no doubts apart that. The shipment was delivered previous to the delivery date, and apart form the phone the seller send me for free, 2 rubber cases, a set of screen protection and a car charger in addition to the wall charger. Everything Perfect!! Thank you!"
"Apple",1,"because the iphone is fiddled, and has many damaging and this product is not fit for the work he cheatDishonest seller and I have sold my iPhone 4 32 GB and has many malfunction in the device like Sbakr and headsets and order"
"Apple",5,"the best service i ever have The phone is look and act like new.If this site have something you need get it very profecional. Thanks"
"Apple",3,"But I request Iphone 4 32GB and we send me 16GB. but the telephone is 100% new. with all accessories."
"Apple",3,"The phone itself is in good condition and works well. It does, however, have 3 small scratches on the screen that are highly visible. They did not emphasize this in the description. They also said they'd send a USB charger, which they did, but it is old, gross, and the inside wires are exposed and taped together. Totally unacceptable. I bought another iPhone 4 from a different seller and it was exactly as it was described. Needless to say, I was very happy with the other seller. Maybe this seller can learn to do more honest business like them."
"Apple",2,"the front button does not work."
"Apple",2,"Good phone but when you call someone or get a call you can't talk in the phone. The person on the other line can't hear you."
"Apple",4,"good received"
"Apple",5,"It was exactly what I wanted. I am very pleased."
"Apple",1,"bulls***"
"Apple",4,"Very clean product two thumbs up."
"Apple",4,"Good"
"Apple",1,"Horrible. Guy scammed me. Could barely hear the person you were talking to."
"Apple",5,"GOOD PHONE I BuY tow times"
"Apple",5,"Item as advertised delivered promptly and securely... 5 stars!!!"
"Apple",2,"Appearance very good. This product initially worked OK but soon started dying suddenly, would not stay charged. Battery probably was not good and needs to be replaced. I was mostly disappointed because I bought this for my son & should've tried to return it as soon as it started giving him trouble."
"Apple",1,"The calling started glitching after a week and noone can hear me on the other line, alot of bugs and problems, starting to become real slow also"
"Apple",1,"Apple no longer supports this product, and it cannot be updated to the latest iOS. Buyer beware."
"Apple",1,"Never buy from Next Gen Wireless.The phone I got had a broken receiver and I could only listen to phone calls on speaker phone. I had to return the phone after spending hours looking online for solutions and trying to figure out what the problem was. When I contacted them about the problem and returned it, they said they would 'have their technicians inspect it' before refunding the money. The phone most definitely did not work and they got back to me saying that their technicians couldnt find anything wrong with the phone and that they would refund me, but charge me a ""restocking fee"" since the phone was now ""used.""On top of that, they sent me fake headphones and a fake charging cord. Apple blocks unauthorized lightning cords and when I finally gave up with the phone and went to back it up before returning it, the cord never worked, never charged the phone, and couldnt form a connection with my itunes. The battery life on the phone was also practically nothing which leads me to believe the phone was either also fake or used/refurbished. Either one sucks since I paid for what was listed as a new phone and ended up paying them to take it back ""used"" - probably to sell it to someone else new again.If I could I would give 0 stars. This is a bs product from a bs company with terrible customer service and service, period."
"Apple",5,"works great everything exactly as advertised thank you"
"Apple",3,"Ok"
"Apple",5,"very good"
"Apple",1,"the phone did not last for even two weeks before it developed a fault"
"Apple",1,"They told me this one new. But this old.don't give me charger and semi open pin."
"Apple",4,"good"
"Apple",5,"It is an apple iPhone 4 what to say more."
"Apple",4,"This iPhone was very affordable and so far it's worked pretty well. I've had a few issues with it though. Issues, like it freezing for about 15 mn shutting down and restarting. Or a slow processor. The phone still works to this day and I've had this issue twice. It's been two weeks since it's happened though! Overall it's been a great phone so far and I am very pleased I got it. Good luck:)"
"Apple",5,"phone was ordered on a Saturday was at my door with fedex on Tuesday..... shipping estiment on Amzon automated was 45+days I got in a toatal order to my Door in 4days........ Phone Looked light a brand new phone and by new like I payed 500+ was well worth it. love the phone all accessories were in box. Live is good!"
"Apple",1,"I purchased this iPhone because the seller said it was unlocked. Once I received it I found out it was not unlocked. I reached out to Hillside Deals twice to see what they could do about this problem. I was hoping they would still be able to unlock the phone. I did not receive any response from the seller.Amazon worked very quickly in refunding the money I paid but my issue is not completely solved because I am still without an unlocked iPhone. I live in Haiti so the process of finding, purchasing, shipping and receiving is very long. Now I have to do it all over again. Thank you Amazon for your help but I will not be purchasing anything through Hillside Deals again."
"Apple",5,"I bought and received in perfect conditions here in Brazil.It works very well and 32GB is a fantastic size to put pictures and songs..."
"Apple",5,"The phone is absolutely perfect. It was able to do everything I needed it to do plus much more. Hopefully I can find a 5 at a great price so I can upgrade"
"Apple",1,"This SELLER stated that he would give me a discount for my troubles. A discount of $10.00?? I spent that much just sending him BACK his defective iPhone. So were is my DISCOUNT?? He must really though I was a fool twice?? I may have to file in a small claims court to get a working iPhone plus a REAL DISCOUNT!!"
"Apple",1,"good afternoon my user is velis33@gmail.com I make a purchase of a 32GB iPhone 4 used the day February 15, 2014, I wonder if I'm already happened with the team why not come ah me anything yet and I waiting time"
"Apple",1,"I received the IPhone 4 and found that the microphone does not work"
"Apple",5,"best purchase I have ever made. the phone came in great condition, maybe a couple of little scratches but that was mentioned in the details box. I love my iphone and have never had a problem with it"
"Apple",1,"Over all apple products are very manipulative, and overpriced. I try my phone for almost 5 days and no matter what application I want to access I have to connect my I-phone to my I-tone!! And of course I have to give all my personal information i.e. my address, my e-mail, my phone number even credit card number!!!! It is absolutely ridicules. Also the futures on this phone compare to Galaxy from Samsung are comparing apples and oranges. This phone doesn't offer anything without connecting to your I-tones."
"Apple",4,"I am incredibly anti apple do to there over pricing of all products and withholding technology so that later models can include these ""new"" enhancements. however when it comes to battery life and a clean interface iphones are quite good, and thanks to OS 6 blue tooth can now be used on apple products. if you have a different carrier buy a factory unlocked phone to avoid issues and don't bother spending the extra 100+ on a slightly newer product, this one works fine"
"Apple",4,"Its a great product. But I see no reason why you should buy from here. You can get 8 GB Apple iPhone 4 from apple store for much less. I removed one star as I am unsure of the quality of this phone. I broke the front touch screen accidently and while getting it repaired from apple authorized technician, he informed me that its a refurbished phone. Originally it was a black iPhone which was made white by changing the front and back panel and some other parts. So be aware!"
"Apple",5,"This phone came to me perfect! Little bit of signs of cosmetic wear but hardly noticeable! Great buy! Came unlocked as well."
"Apple",4,"Phone is good as expected, missing org box which was not mentioned.and best part its on latest iOS v"
"Apple",3,"Good morning, I'm very upset about the purchase I made, which appeared as a new product purchase and really do not look new, I sent them unboxed and without instructions, I assume were hutch devices, they are white and one of they appear with a yellowish white.I have doubts to purchase online on Amazon, E-bay maybe a little more professional about choosing appliance suppliers know them inside your networkregards"
"Apple",4,"I got this from the seller 'transformersandgmsphones' and it came really fast!It's been working really nice to me :)But I have one complain.. it's an asian version, so every time I take pictures it sounds!!! even if it's on silent mode. If anyone knows how to fix this (without a jailbreak) please let me know :)Other than that, the iPhone 4 is an awesome phone. Even though the camera sucks.xx"
"Apple",1,"I received the iPhone i order.The problem is that it doesn't works ok, I am having problems when I call someone from it they don't listen to what I say, I already tread to restore it but it steal doesn't work.The biggest problem aim having is, that I leave I Argentina Buenos Aires and when I go to an Apple store in my country they told me that hear in Argentina they don't have service for IPhone.So I bought an IPhone and I am not able to speak with it."
"Apple",5,"Parabéns!para o loja que vendeu o Apple iphone 4 32GB...esse aparelho é tudo de bom nos momentos atuais...ele resolve tudo e ti deixa perto dos familiares e amigos...tem coisa melhor?? Se tem nao conheço mi apresente.Apple estar de PARABÈNS!!Hoje com o meu apple iphone4 sou a pessoa mais feliz..OBRIGADA."
"Apple",2,"I'm paying over 400 for this iPhone which is fine but don't advertise that the phone is excellent condition if the home button is broken and the back glass seems like it was put in unprofessionally. The camera hole in the back is not align with the glass."
"Apple",5,"good"
"Apple",1,"This phone worked for 2 months before we started to have problems with the speaker. Now the phone doesn't even have the ability to work correctly at all. Tried the online fixes, but it doesn't work!!! Way too much money spent for something that worked well for a month!!!"
"Apple",5,"Phone was in pristine condition. I am extremely pleased."
"Apple",1,"The phone volume is not working well and the touche home also"
"Apple",5,"Phone was as describe and in perfect condition love it"
"Apple",5,"This was better than described, phone is like new, with barely visible scratches, no dents or serious damage, came with all accessories even when it did say that it only included was the phone"
"Apple",5,"I recommend the seller 100 % excellent products"
"Apple",4,"good quality 2nd had phone for $90.00"
"Apple",1,"The phone is perfect but he send me the headphones and the charger generic(no the original's)"
"Apple",5,"Excellent condition."
"Apple",1,"My phone do not be quiet when it is in silent mode especially when I take a pic.in addition, they gave me low quality earphones."
"Apple",5,"The phone is in excellent condition, all features and functions work very well. Great amount of memory. Enjoying it a great deal."
"Apple",2,"I had to pay a service to unlock it. And it really took time to and money to finally fix it"
"Apple",1,"I was sold a phone by this seller under the description of ""used like new"", the package arrived before the due date which was awesome and appeared to be as described, COSMETICALLY . The next day the charger wasn't working, no big deal chargers are easy to replace. A week to the day I received the product it quit working completely. I notified the seller immediately!! He replied within 2 hours, explaining he worked in the week and would get back to me over the weekend with options of how to go about fixing the problem. Which in turn ended up in me sending a second email of which he informed me that he would not give me a refund, and offered $40 maximum... I BARLEY HAD THE PHONE A WEEK!!!!! THE PHONE WAS NOT IN WORKING CONDITIONS, AND I SPENT ALMOST $400 IN THE PRODUCT AND SHIPPING FOR A BROKEN PHONE THAT THE SELLER BELIEVES IS NOW ONLY WORTH $40!!! I AM BEYOND UPSET AND I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND THAT ANYONE MAKE A PURCHASE FROM CAM-O-RAMA WITH OUT HAVING A LEGAL REPRESENTATIVE TO LOOK FOR LOOP HOLES IN THE REFUNDING DEPARTMENT! I WILL NEVER BUY ANYTHING OFF OF AMAZON KNOWING THAT THERE IS REALLY PEOPLE LIKE THIS OUT HERE!! I read almost all the reviews and ratings before buying from this seller, as well as other sellers before making my purchase. I am now out of $400 dollars, and have a black screened iphone to show for it! THANK YOU CAM-O-RAMA!! FOR NOTHING!""Since I can only provide DOA (dead on arrival) guarantee and because the phone wasdelivered as in described condition (used but fully functional), Iwon't be able to take a full return for it. HOWEVER, I always do thebest I can to help my buyers. I would like to offer you a $40 refund..."""
"Apple",1,"I bought an annouced factory unlocked phone and I received a locked one. I won't trust anymore on the provider."
"Apple",5,"Excelente vendedor recomendado al cien porciento. Excelente equipo y excelentes precios recomiendo al 100 % sin mas que agregar. ..."
"Apple",5,"The package arrived in time and in perfect conditions! I had an awesome feed back, I completely recomend to buy with this guy!"
"Apple",1,"This product was an OLD re-built iPhone pieced together and sold for WAY too much money! I bought this product specifically for traveling overseas so I could substitute SIM cards in different countries. I had problems with it and took it into an Apple Store. They examined it and said the serial number had been changed as well as the components. I had to buy a REAL iphone from them. The warranty period was very short but I plan to discuss this with Amazon.com to see if anything can be done to refund my money.This seller is a total rip-off - don’t buy from Ross Cellular!"
"Apple",5,"I have never written a review for any product I purchased. I make an exception here because, Mr. Kyle Wunderli, of Better Deals FASTER is a preeminent businessman who has very high quality products, super fast delivery time, and superb customer skills. Although I paid a little more from this seller than from another, I would purchase from this seller again!"
"Apple",5,"Pros:Works smoothly with 99% apps.(Surprisingly Subway Surfer lags sometimes while Temple Run 2 works flawlessly. Maybe some coding problem)High pixel density makes the watching movies and reading books a joy.No bloatware unlike most Android phones.Camera works great in well-lit conditions.Touch is really smooth.Build quality is amazing and phone feels premium in one's hand.Battery lasts over a day with moderate usage (1/2 hour calling, 1 hour gaming, 1 hour video)Cons:Can't share files over bluetooth.Price/Screen size ratio is much larger compared to Android phones.Slightly heavy."
"Apple",5,"This phone is working great right out of the box. All I had to do is pop in a SIM card and I was off and running. I ordered for Universal Cell Services. I recommend them."
"Apple",1,"The phone had already some repair done to it. The on and off device was broken and I had to bring it to a repair shop to make it again. It costs me 50$. The repairman discovered it was repaired before. Since I was abroad it was to hard to sent the phone back. Very bad business. I was conned. Severina Kolloffel"
"Apple",5,"Works great! Love it! Can't get enough of it! Make me wanna slap my mamma with it! It's so good!"
"Apple",4,"Good Iphone I have no comments for the product, may be I had check for another one for me but Iphone five unlocked."
"Apple",1,"I would have given it less than one star, but that isn't an option. I ordered this unlocked iphone and was so excited. Then a week goes by and I still don't have my phone. I check my Amazon account and it tells me the phone has already been delivered. IT WASN'T. I had to contact Amazon (they were great by the way) for a refund, which was issued before we even finished up on the online chat.DON'T USE THESE PEOPLE."
"Apple",3,"Apple makes an excellent product, so I have no complaints about the phone itself. However, it came with no accessories: not even a charger?!? That was disappointing."
"Apple",5,"Thank you so much for the iphone! It arrived in good condition and I absolutely enjoy getting to know my first ever iphone device :)"
"Apple",5,"The Cell Apple iPhone 4 (Black) 32GB (Factory Unlocked) Was very good. It was excelent. I give you thanks a lot."
"Apple",5,"I read the review for the seller before I ordered the phone. He was very helpful and understanding. He even went as far as putting addition money out of his pocket to expedite my shipment. I would recommend him for anybody. My wife is extremely pleased with the phone....no issue whatsoever. Thank you."
"Apple",1,"The phone screen broke and took it to a repair shop. There I was told that the screen had been replaced before.I bought the phone for new and got a used one.Avoid Cali Wholesale"
"Apple",4,"Very good quality"
"Apple",5,"Great phone. Had to trade it for another item at one time and bought another one, very well made phone"
"Apple",5,"No problems. I like this iphone"
"Apple",1,"I purchased this product in the month July 2014 and by January 2015 this product was not working , when I contact amazon response Amazom warrant was only for 3 months but the ditribudor (apple ) Give me warranty for one year . When I went to apple to my surprise the product I buy ""new"" was not new so the house could not do anything"
"Apple",1,"Stopped working a month after I bought it ... Waste of time"
"Apple",3,"sometimes it stucked on home button"
"Apple",4,"Thanks for the great deal and fast shipping."
"Apple",2,"The keyboard are working properly."
"Apple",2,"Item was not brand new as advertised. This is quite deceptive selling reconditioned items as brand new. My phone is already giving issues."
"Apple",2,"Phone is ok .. but there is a big scratch on camera lense that was not reported"
"Apple",2,"After several weeks of use my son said the home button stopped working. I told him to make sure everything was working, but the phone part is working"
"Apple",5,"I bought this phone for my Daughter and she is loving it. It was delivered quickly and the condition of the phone was just as was stated. She was able to turn it on and use it right away with absolutely no problems. I would highly recommend purchasing from this seller. He was honest about the product and even added a person thanks in our receipt and was available to us if there was a problem."
"Apple",5,"Easy to answer,simple to use compared to other operating systems. I traded in LG phone and bought my apple on li"
"Apple",5,"I had attempted to write this once before, but really did not know what to say. I have to say that the seller of this product, was excellent. they said that it would be fast delivery, and it was, there were only minor cosmetic markings on the face of the phone but you would have to look really hard to find them. At first I was very skeptical about buying a used phone. I don't think that would be a fear for me now. I would defiantly order from this seller again with no hesitation.they were true with what they advertized. I was new to iPhone so I really did not know much about them. I received the phone and was able to begin operations immediately. I would and have recommended this family, friends, and people on the job.Thanks to Amazon and Ideals,A very satisfied customer ."
"Apple",1,"I sent back the iPHONE 4 one month ago because it does not respond when you push the bottom button to cancel or go back some of the time. I haven't received refund yet. What's going on? Please issue refund as soon as possible. Thank you."
"Apple",3,"Worked fine for 6 weeks but now screen is not displaying part of the top most left corner. Still functional, but annoying...."
"Apple",5,"I am so pleased with this purchase! Phone is in excellent condition as described and shipping was fast! This was one of the best purchases i've made and I'm so glad it was with bestDeals!! Thank you so much....absolutely no regrets and I will continue to buy merchandise from them!"
"Apple",5,"Phone came in perfect condition, also came unlocked as promised(I'm writing this straight from the iPhone on straight talk) very satisfied."
"Apple",1,"soon u will be in prison i already contacted general attorney just remember where ever you hide we can always find you  i hope u scared of what your doing i think ur not believing of bad karma just remember bad karma its always back to you"
"Apple",5,"This was a used item but was in excellent condition. It was factory unlocked as promised. Just had to insert a micro sim card and we were up and running with our Tmobile account. The charger included did not work but we had an extra charger so it wasn't a problem."
"Apple",1,"it worst mobile phone I had bougth in my life so bad when i recharge it the mobile phone became very hot it is very slow and off/on button does not work perfectly"
"Apple",3,"my son use for one year"
"Apple",4,"It's a great phone, no problems."
"Apple",5,"The phone was defective, but there was great service who fixed the issue."
"Apple",1,"This phone would freeze up on me and was terribly slow. The reception was a very bad, too. This phone was running on 3g. I went back to my android phone."
"Apple",1,"avoid, not good!!!! - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -"
"Apple",5,"excelent"
"Apple",4,"This is a great item. I am pleased with the condition as well as the operation of it, however the battery reflects the age of the device. Besides the battery depleting its charge rather quickly I am happy with this phone."
"Apple",5,"Good price"
"Apple",5,"As described & in great condition"
"Apple",1,"At first I like the delivery it was fast, but after I open the box the iPhone was dirty I need to clean it first. It is color white and some parts are still dirty I don't know? What to use in cleaning that particular area it's color tan. I just really need the phone that's why I did not return it but I will never ever recommend amazon to my friends when it comes to gadgets. Sorry but there should not even dents on it but it has. Please next time you have to make it sure that you have to surpass. The expectations of you customers."
"Apple",4,"I am not so technologically gifted that I wanted an iPhone 5, so the iPhone 4 was the right ticket. It seems more intuitive than other smart phones I've played with. There are lots of pluses and features that I don't even know about yet. I'm embarrassed small children can manage this phone easier than I, but this is going to get me over the top. Not if, but ""when"" I get better at using this phone, I'll get my daughter one."
"Apple",4,"The phone seems to be working very well no problems it had the storage capacity that was in the description looked felt and worked like a brand new phone so I will repost in a few months letting you know if the status remains the same."
"Apple",1,"This phone is a total piece of crap! When I got it, the home button and one of the speakers didn't work. I've dropped another $100 fixing it. Too overpriced for the condition it was in. Never again will I buy from this seller."
"Apple",1,"It wasn’t only a refurbished item instead of unused item. The IPhone 4 I received and sent back is a fraud.On october 17, I spent more than 2 hours at the Genius Bar of Apple Store at 5th Avenue, New York. They recommended me to do a back up first and come back the other day.The following day, 18, in Apple Store at 14th Street, New York, I spent another 2 hours at the Genius Bar just to know 1) that they couldn't just replace the phone because it was out of warranty - it expired two years before, one year after it had been bought by its first owner, in June 2010. So if wanted a replacement I'd have to pay US$ 150 for it - which I accepted; and 2) at the very moment of the transaction, the guy who served me at the shop counter noticed something in the iPhone and asked me to wait. He checked the serial number and found that the iPhone was originally a black one - the one I bought was a white one. He couldn't replace it.They didn't have a new iPhone 4 to sell, and I needed desperately to buy a cell phone because I was leaving the next day to Brazil. I bought an iPhone 5C unlocked for $649 + taxes, as you can see in the annexed file. Total: US$ 706.59.If you want to be fair, please deposit the difference of U$ 266,50 (706,59 - 439,98) I had to pay. I wont charge for the four hours of my vacation I wasted at Apple’s counter, neither for the worry and inconvenience I had with your item .I send alrady several emails and I'm still waiting for an answer. Hope to hear from you soon."
"Apple",1,"This phone is Described as NEW but obviously is not, phone appeared new in factory box. The first phone died after 2 hours, the screen when blank and could not be restarted. The second one worked okay except that the microphone was bad and callers could not hear you, nor could you do a voice recording."
"Apple",5,"Seller was very helpful.Product is working very well.a couple of scratches. One is due to the hard cover which was covering the top of the screen"
"Apple",5,"Decided to upgrade my phone and found this phone available. Works fine and arrived without a problem. Price was acceptable and thee were no issues in the purchase or delivery of the phone."
"Apple",1,"Obviously it's not a NEW phone. There are scratches on the screen. After 1 day, the battery still can not be 100% charged. I returned the phone."
"Apple",5,"everything is said it would be. I've had a bad run with used and restored iPhones in the past so I went for this one and it was worth it"
"Apple",5,"Each day I become more and more satisfied with the Apple iPhone. Amazing performance, incredible graphics, very very functional, a great camera, great touch-screen response, thousand of useful and funny apps, excellent operating system. Apple shows why she's the market leader with this product."
"Apple",5,"AWESOME phone! Absolutely love it. Came to me brand new in mint condition. Too expensive, but I had to indulge."
"Apple",5,"0 complainsthe iphone came to me brand new....and im using it in Caracas Venezuela, without any trouble!!!!!I think, these models come from europe, cause the battery charger, but these people incorporates an adaptor plug!!!"
"Apple",4,"I love my iPhone even though I have not been able to use it. I've always loved iPhone and was waiting patiently to get one. Also bought the SIM cutter and cut my Digicel Sim, however it does not work with the iphone. I called APPLE and they said a cut SIM will NOT work, I'll HAVE TO get a micro sim, as the connections are different. FOR THIS, APPLE LOSES 1 STAR because now I have to wait another day and spend some money with another network to get a micro sim in order to use my phone - Boo!Until then, it's back to my faithful iTouch.. BTW, my cut sim is back in my Nokia and working fine, so it wasn't damaged during the cut. Learn from my misinformation and don't waste ur $ on a Micro SIM Cutter, Converter with 2 SIM adapters UNTIL you verify a cut SIM will work with the SIM provider and others on the network.One-day shipping was great. Got all my items securely packaged and intact. Thanks Amazon."
"Apple",1,"I bought this Iphone form SJohnson236, and they send me locked Iphone with Gevey Adapter and ATT Software, I returned it the same day, and I got the refund, Thanks to Amazon"

"Apple",5,"My granddaughter is very pleased with her Iphone4."
"Apple",5,"I have been using Iphone 4 for 4 years. Have no complaints whatsoever."
"Apple",1,"This phone didn't last 2 months. When I checked to view the return policy, it was only for 30 days. That's not fair. The speaker isn't working and the phone shuts down unexpectedly. I believe this phone was never a new phone!. Buyers beware!"
"Apple",5,"The phone works perfect. My son loved it!!! the shipment is really fast and don't have problem with activating it. Thank you!!! AWESOME!!"
"Apple",1,"One of the speakers is broken from water damage, i learned cause i got it with a broken screen also and when i went to get it fixed they told me why complete waste."
"Apple",2,"It looks so old. I don't expect it look so old like that."
"Apple",3,"Positive items: the wide array of apps."
"Apple",5,"This iPhone has exceeded my expectations. It is so reliable and I have already recommended it to my friends. The voice and other added features are just incredible"
"Apple",3,"I like the product and the time in receiving it. Would recommend to my friends and others. Good to go."
"Apple",5,"excelente vendedor desde venezuela todo perfecto gran telefono sin detalle alguno llego en el tiempo estimado en excelentes condiciones gracias"
"Apple",1,"This phone broke after 5 weeks the microphone quit working and I needed a working phone that day, I had to bring it to Apple, they gave me a new phone for $150, so add this to the $300 I paid for this phone so I got a brand new factory unlocked 32 GB iPhone 4 for $450 which is ok."
"Apple",1,"Purchased I Phone 4 32 GB Factory Unlocked everything was working well the first day! Product came in the mail over to Italy where I am stationed in 5 days! Which is real fast! While I was sleeping Voice Control started to come on and off by itself and not to mention the home button stops working as well!

I received my phone today and it is perfect there is NO damage and it works perfectly. Thank you so much for the great experiance!!"
"Apple",1,"No, they didn't meet my expectation. I ordered an original Samsung galaxy S4 and they sent me a fake one in a foreign language!"

"Apple",5,"this product seems to be brand new have no problems with the phone at all no scratches or dents very happy with it"
"Apple",1,"If everything you ship is like this than i will advise everybody to not buy from you. I got this phone and about a day after it started to break. The third day one of the speakers went out, the next the lock button got stuck and no longer works. now the home button barely works, i have to push certain areas for it to even respond. Im pretty sure the rest of this phone is going to fail at some point, thanks for wasting my money"
"Apple",5,"When I received this iphone 4 it was in great condition, but it somehow slipped through the cracks and the unlock and updated os was not completed. I found this out when I tried to have a prepaid service turned on and shelled out $60 for a chip that was nonrefundable. I was furious, I expected the worst to try and resolve this issue, but when I emailed him on Friday night about 6 pm western time he responded within 20 minutes. He apologized profusely and talked me through how to finish the unlock and update til 11:30. then when I installed my new chip it works fine and has been fine ever since I would definitely recommend and buy from this seller again. Things happen and he stood behind his product well past regular business hours."
"Apple",1,"Apple iPhone 4 16GB (Black) - VerizonI feel really stupid. I should have read all the reviews about Wireovia. Like so many others the home button is locked and the only way I can move from app to app is to turn the phone off and on. I am surprised that Amazon is still allowing them to sell on their site."
"Apple",1,"I bought this phone NEW, when I opened the box it did not look new at all. I bought this phone and a straight talk sim card, so a few days of Me having this phone I was having an issue sending and receiving picture messages. So I called straight talk and they told Me it was an apple issue. I called Apple and they told Me this phone was not used and belonged to someone in Italy and they had unlocked it and also they noticed the jailbreak which I didn't know about. So they said they couldn't help Me with the issue...So now I am stuck with a phone that can't send out picture messages unless it is another iphone."

I have to say that the seller of this product, was excellent. they said that it would be fast delivery, and it was, there were only minor cosmetic markings on the face of the phone but you would have to look really hard to find them. At first I was very skeptical about buying a used phone. I don't think that would be a fear for me now. I would defiantly order from this seller again with no hesitation.they were true with what they advertized. I was new to iPhone so I really did not know much about them. I received the phone and was able to begin operations immediately. I would and have recommended this family, friends, and people on the job.Thanks to Amazon and Ideals,A very satisfied customer ."
"Apple",1,"I sent back the iPHONE 4 one month ago because it does not respond when you push the bottom button to cancel or go back some of the time. I haven't received refund yet. What's going on? Please issue refund as soon as possible. Thank you."
"Apple",3,"Worked fine for 6 weeks but now screen is not displaying part of the top most left corner. Still functional, but annoying...."
"Apple",5,"I am so pleased with this purchase! Phone is in excellent condition as described and shipping was fast! This was one of the best purchases i've made and I'm so glad it was with bestDeals!! Thank you so much....absolutely no regrets and I will continue to buy merchandise from them!"
"Apple",5,"Phone came in perfect condition, also came unlocked as promised(I'm writing this straight from the iPhone on straight talk) very satisfied."
"Apple",1,"soon u will be in prison i already contacted general attorney just remember where ever you hide we can always find you  i hope u scared of what your doing i think ur not believing of bad karma just remember bad karma its always back to you"
"Apple",5,"This was a used item but was in excellent condition. It was factory unlocked as promised. Just had to insert a micro sim card and we were up and running with our Tmobile account. The charger included did not work but we had an extra charger so it wasn't a problem."
"Apple",2,"the front button does not work."
"Apple",2,"Good phone but when you call someone or get a call you can't talk in the phone. The person on the other line can't hear you."
"Apple",4,"good received"

"Apple",5,"bought it as a present for my friend. she is happy."
"Apple",5,"excellent"
"Apple",4,"Excelent Product"
"Apple",1,"They sold it as a new phone but at day 40 it stopped working. The official Apple service confirmed that the iphone was not new, but rearmed with parts from other phones and that several of them were defective.It is a shame that mislead buyers this way. Do not buy this kind of phone."
"Apple",5,"llego en excelentes condiciones a venezuela, es liberado, funciona con digitel movistar y movilnet, tal cual lo describian en la paginaarrived in excellent condition Venezuela, is released, works with movistar and movilnet digitel, described it as such on page"
"Apple",1,"This Iphone is on IOS 7.02 I tried so many time to update to current IOS but it won't work. Also iphone 4 camera is pretty bad I can't video call or record videos clear nor can I take selfies clear its blurry. I was expecting better quality iphone for What I have paid but this is so bad iphone. Very disappointed"
"Apple",5,"excellent"
"Apple",5,"Really unlocked, I just put in my sim card and activated using iTunes."
"Apple",5,"It was what I was looking for in a Phone thanks for the music. I was Happy with the phone."
"Apple",5,"Phone was in near perfect shape and it came with accessories. Phone works great. If your looking for a phone I would recommend this place."
"Apple",5,"they arived in time in APO adress-Afghanistan its nice to buy used iphones when they are in good care,without problems,working perfect,recived as described"
"Apple",2,"The phone had been opened. 3 Screws missing along with wifi connector clip and antenna clip under battery connector miss placed. Result little wifi connect ability. Hidden damage."
"Apple",1,"I bought because It said that It was unlocked but It wasn't. Now I am in my country, Ecuador and It doesn't work so it is not open to use it worldwide.DON'T BELIEVE THIS GUY !"
"Apple",5,"this product seems to be brand new have no problems with the phone at all no scratches or dents very happy with it"
"Apple",1,"If everything you ship is like this than i will advise everybody to not buy from you. I got this phone and about a day after it started to break. The third day one of the speakers went out, the next the lock button got stuck and no longer works. now the home button barely works, i have to push certain areas for it to even respond. Im pretty sure the rest of this phone is going to fail at some point, thanks for wasting my money"
"Apple",5,"When I received this iphone 4 it was in great condition, but it somehow slipped through the cracks and the unlock and updated os was not completed. I found this out when I tried to have a prepaid service turned on and shelled out $60 for a chip that was nonrefundable. I was furious, I expected the worst to try and resolve this issue, but when I emailed him on Friday night about 6 pm western time he responded within 20 minutes. He apologized profusely and talked me through how to finish the unlock and update til 11:30. then when I installed my new chip it works fine and has been fine ever since I would definitely recommend and buy from this seller again. Things happen and he stood behind his product well past regular business hours."
"Apple",1,"Apple iPhone 4 16GB (Black) - VerizonI feel really stupid. I should have read all the reviews about Wireovia. Like so many others the home button is locked and the only way I can move from app to app is to turn the phone off and on. I am surprised that Amazon is still allowing them to sell on their site."
"Apple",1,"I bought this phone NEW, when I opened the box it did not look new at all. I bought this phone and a straight talk sim card, so a few days of Me having this phone I was having an issue sending and receiving picture messages. So I called straight talk and they told Me it was an apple issue. I called Apple and they told Me this phone was not used and belonged to someone in Italy and they had unlocked it and also they noticed the jailbreak which I didn't know about. So they said they couldn't help Me with the issue...So now I am stuck with a phone that can't send out picture messages unless it is another iphone."
"Apple",1,"The phone shuts itself off even when the battery isn't dead. The battery dies in less than two days even with NO use! It's supposedly new in the box and that appeared to be true but it seems we will have to replace the battery. Not sure if it was a good price after all."
"Apple",5,"I have been using the cell phone for 1 month and it is working very good, i would definetely recomend it , just you need to know that this kind of apple cell phone doesnt work with sprint, verizon and METROPCS but with T Mobile and AT & T works good."
"Apple",5,"Great"
"Apple",5,"This is exactly the Iphone that I need, especially if I will travel international. I love it."
"Apple",5,"Your product is very good I recommend other customer to buy your product you exceed my expectation."
"Apple",2,"The product was fake"
"Apple",2,"As stated in the description, the iPhone had little to no scratches around the phone. Good Job here. After turning it on, here's where the problems began to stir up. Due note that I previously owned a 4s prior and only ordered this one because I loved the phone, lost the phone and thought I'd try another one.Music - I'm a BIG fan of music. With this phone, I am not able to play music, smoothly from Tune In as once before. The issue starts whenever I have Wifi and Carrier service on at the same time. Never a problem with prior.GMaps + Music - Normally, I could listen to music while getting directions from GMaps. With this phone, every turn-by-turn direction causes my music to stop completely and I have to press play in order to start the music again. Never a problem with prior.Home Double-Tap Button - When I attempt to use this feature to navigate through opened apps, it would work about 1 out of 5 tries. Never a problem with prior.Wifi On/Off - Normally, I could turn my wifi on/off, interchangeably, between use with apps and never had a problem; however, apps recognize that the wifi is off and only consider this the designated source for data transfer. To fix, I've had to turn the phone off completely for it to refresh. Never a problem with prior.I am currently in the process of returning this phone, for they have a 90 Day Return policy. Fingers are crossed to see if I get a better replacement.Hopefully this review has helped make a decision for you in the future."
"Apple",5,"A+++"
"Apple",5,"EXCELLENT!"
"Apple",4,"When I bought this phone, it arrived packaged as new, and it worked and looked fine with no problems. However, it came with iOS 7.1.1, which is rather confusing since that OS came out more than 2 years after the phone did. When I questioned the seller about it, they said that it was updated by Apple before they liquidated the phone off to the seller. Since I had specifically wanted it to have the original iOS, I returned it without any hassle.TL;DR - If you want the original iOS, don't buy this phone."
"Apple",5,"The battery and the microphone are not good."
"Apple",1,"This phone does not work and could not be sync with itunes....i need to return it. please help on how to go about returning it!"
"Apple",5,"great deal. came in original packaging. will buy from again."
"Apple",5,"Great phone!!"
"Apple",5,"I have high anxiety so that made me very nervous purchasing an Iphone 4 off line. I had contacted the seller a number of times concerned about the shipment, but he was great at getting back with me right away. He answered every question and was very patient. I received my phone today and it is perfect there is NO damage and it works perfectly. Thank you so much for the great experiance!!"
"Apple",1,"No, they didn't meet my expectation. I ordered an original Samsung galaxy S4 and they sent me a fake one in a foreign language!"
"Apple",5,"Love it now that my work mates can text me for any shift changes or new shift been added into work schedule"
"Apple",4,"Good"
"Apple",5,"My iPhone is amazing and worked right away! Thanks so much for the instructions in the box too. Look forward to doing business with you again!!!!"
"Apple",1,"Mic not working"
"Apple",5,"Haw mathe"
"Apple",4,"Very good Excellent .. what I wanted the complete packageI like"
"Apple",2,"seem refubricated not authentic."
"Apple",5,"looked almost new, barely visible scratches, front and back looks when you get it from store looks new and it works great thank you so much"
"Apple",5,"Good quality, factory sealed."
"Apple",1,"Simply put, this phone didn't work for more than two weeks."
"Apple",3,"Bought the phone from RnD Outlet - 'New' from Amazon. Recieved the phone and took it to an Apple store to give it a check over. Unsurprising the phone is not New. It was Sold in a Best Buy in 2010 (thanks to the apple store guys for checking it for me). It has no warranty, obviously because it is not new but at least the internal parts are all legitimate apple components. The plastic screen protectors have been removed and put back on again - you can tell because there are specks of dirt or grit all over it (another point to it being second hand). On the plus side it does indeed appear to be Unlocked. Not going to return it, it looks in good enough condition. Hopefully it is not going to die in the first few months."
"Apple",1,"Item not as described. I returned it."
"Apple",5,"It was a great purchase everything works perfect .. Thanks"
"Apple",4,"I'm having to downgrade from my 4S while it gets fixed and I miss my 4S. This camera is significantly worse than in the 4S."
"Apple",5,"As all Apple products, it's my number one choice. It's very convenient, easy to use, and works great. It has everything I need in a phone, a personal planner device, entertainment, and anything else you can think of, it's got it all."
"Apple",5,"I was a little disappointed at the beginning, thinking I was getting a 4S. But when I checked back on the item description, I realized that it was a 4 the whole time- I just didn't read it well.Either way, I have enjoyed the 32gb of space, enabling me to put more music on my phone.I was able to unlock this phone easily with At&t."
"Apple",1,"Este telefono le funciona muy mal su cámara. Las fotos me salen borrosas, no sirve su camara frontal. no hace el cambio y se queda trancado. Parece a simple vista nuevo, pero estoy segura que es remanufacturado ya que tiene rayones en el boton de superior encendido. no trajo calcomanias, no trajo la llave para la sim card. su plastico protector fue removido y estaba sucio con huellas dactilares por todos lados... y lo compre en estatus de NUEVO Fui estafado por esta gente. NO RECOMENDADO.This phone will work very badly their camera. The photos came out blurry me, front camera is wrong, does not change . Looks new, but I'm sure it's rebuilt as it has scratches on the top button on. I brought status new, did not bring the key for the sim card. its protective plastic was removed and put , is dirty with fingerprints... . I scammed by these people. NOT RECOMMENDED...."
"Apple",4,"Looks great and is easy to use and update the software, but you have to be careful how you hold it or you attenuate the antenna and don't get much signal."
"Apple",4,"the iphone is perfect , just who buy the phone has to make sure the storage capacity of the phone. series of iphone 4 are all the same from outside but the capacity of the storage could be 8 GB or 16 GB AND or 32 GB. make sure and ask the seller about this, and TAKE CONSIDERATION I PHONE 4 HAS A NO CAPABILITY OF 4G ( FAST INTERNET BROWSING.)THE REST ARE PERFECT ."
"Apple",5,"I got this for my husband fr our anniversary and he absolutely loves it, did have alittle issue with the ring volume but had shut the phone off and turned it back on and it fixed the issue now it's been great."
"Apple",5,"All good pretty fast shipping. Signature is required be aware! I didn't know this! I was able to intercept talking to the postmaster. But that's a case by case deal, you may not be able to do that.As the phone goes perfect no complaints at all. Memory was wiped, old non functioning sim in, but was a plus as I used it to cut my normal sim to size. Normal full case wear. No major scratches. If any small I didn't pay any attention as this phone is for work but I don't notice any day to day so I would so none or minimal. Came with aftermarket charger that was a multi charger, another plus! The down side of that it is not compatible with data exchange. And it had the OEM wall charger. Perfect! Didn't expect less or more!"
"Apple",5,"I got an iphone quickly and in good condition. It looks and feels like new and I have had no problems with it yet."
"Apple",1,"I received my order a couple days ago. To be honest, its not what I hoped. Most of the time when I make or receive a call, I hear nothing on the other end. Sometimes the whole thing just goes black, despite having an adequate amount of battery life on it. I am seriously considering sending this back for a refund. I am quite disappointed."
"Apple",5,"here in guam , works perfect ,not any problems to activated, , able to work with any sms card and any region, able to download anything , this works fine!! love it"
"Apple",5,"Gracias excelente"
"Apple",5,"great item!"
"Apple",4,"No scratches looks completely new! No problems with it at all it's been working perfectly fine!"
"Apple",5,"bought this phone for my daughters birthday, and the phone looks untouched very clean and so far no problems with it. My daughter is very happy."
"Apple",5,"My granddaughter is very pleased with her Iphone4."
"Apple",5,"I have been using Iphone 4 for 4 years. Have no complaints whatsoever."
"Apple",1,"This phone didn't last 2 months. When I checked to view the return policy, it was only for 30 days. That's not fair. The speaker isn't working and the phone shuts down unexpectedly. I believe this phone was never a new phone!. Buyers beware!"
"Apple",5,"The phone works perfect. My son loved it!!! the shipment is really fast and don't have problem with activating it. Thank you!!! AWESOME!!"
"Apple",1,"One of the speakers is broken from water damage, i learned cause i got it with a broken screen also and when i went to get it fixed they told me why complete waste."
"Apple",2,"It looks so old. I don't expect it look so old like that."
"Apple",1,"Over all apple products are very manipulative, and overpriced. I try my phone for almost 5 days and no matter what application I want to access I have to connect my I-phone to my I-tone!! And of course I have to give all my personal information i.e. my address, my e-mail, my phone number even credit card number!!!! It is absolutely ridicules. Also the futures on this phone compare to Galaxy from Samsung are comparing apples and oranges. This phone doesn't offer anything without connecting to your I-tones."
"Apple",4,"I am incredibly anti apple do to there over pricing of all products and withholding technology so that later models can include these ""new"" enhancements. however when it comes to battery life and a clean interface iphones are quite good, and thanks to OS 6 blue tooth can now be used on apple products. if you have a different carrier buy a factory unlocked phone to avoid issues and don't bother spending the extra 100+ on a slightly newer product, this one works fine"
"Apple",4,"Its a great product. But I see no reason why you should buy from here. You can get 8 GB Apple iPhone 4 from apple store for much less. I removed one star as I am unsure of the quality of this phone. I broke the front touch screen accidently and while getting it repaired from apple authorized technician, he informed me that its a refurbished phone. Originally it was a black iPhone which was made white by changing the front and back panel and some other parts. So be aware!"
"Apple",5,"This phone came to me perfect! Little bit of signs of cosmetic wear but hardly noticeable! Great buy! Came unlocked as well."
"Apple",4,"Phone is good as expected, missing org box which was not mentioned.and best part its on latest iOS v"
"Apple",3,"Good morning, I'm very upset about the purchase I made, which appeared as a new product purchase and really do not look new, I sent them unboxed and without instructions, I assume were hutch devices, they are white and one of they appear with a yellowish white.I have doubts to purchase online on Amazon, E-bay maybe a little more professional about choosing appliance suppliers know them inside your networkregards"
"Apple",4,"I got this from the seller 'transformersandgmsphones' and it came really fast!It's been working really nice to me :)But I have one complain.. it's an asian version, so every time I take pictures it sounds!!! even if it's on silent mode. If anyone knows how to fix this (without a jailbreak) please let me know :)Other than that, the iPhone 4 is an awesome phone. Even though the camera sucks.xx"
"Apple",1,"I received the iPhone i order.The problem is that it doesn't works ok, I am having problems when I call someone from it they don't listen to what I say, I already tread to restore it but it steal doesn't work.The biggest problem aim having is, that I leave I Argentina Buenos Aires and when I go to an Apple store in my country they told me that hear in Argentina they don't have service for IPhone.So I bought an IPhone and I am not able to speak with it."
"Apple",5,"Parabéns!para o loja que vendeu o Apple iphone 4 32GB...esse aparelho é tudo de bom nos momentos atuais...ele resolve tudo e ti deixa perto dos familiares e amigos...tem coisa melhor?? Se tem nao conheço mi apresente.Apple estar de PARABÈNS!!Hoje com o meu apple iphone4 sou a pessoa mais feliz..OBRIGADA."
"Apple",2,"I'm paying over 400 for this iPhone which is fine but don't advertise that the phone is excellent condition if the home button is broken and the back glass seems like it was put in unprofessionally. The camera hole in the back is not align with the glass."
"Apple",4,"Very good quality"
"Apple",5,"Great phone. Had to trade it for another item at one time and bought another one, very well made phone"
"Apple",5,"No problems. I like this iphone"
"Apple",1,"I purchased this product in the month July 2014 and by January 2015 this product was not working , when I contact amazon response Amazom warrant was only for 3 months but the ditribudor (apple ) Give me warranty for one year . When I went to apple to my surprise the product I buy ""new"" was not new so the house could not do anything"
"Apple",1,"Stopped working a month after I bought it ... Waste of time"
"Apple",3,"sometimes it stucked on home button"
"Apple",4,"Thanks for the great deal and fast shipping."
"Apple",2,"The keyboard are working properly."
"Apple",2,"Item was not brand new as advertised. This is quite deceptive selling reconditioned items as brand new. My phone is already giving issues."
"Apple",2,"Phone is ok .. but there is a big scratch on camera lense that was not reported"
"Apple",5,"It is an apple iPhone 4 what to say more."
"Apple",4,"This iPhone was very affordable and so far it's worked pretty well. I've had a few issues with it though. Issues, like it freezing for about 15 mn shutting down and restarting. Or a slow processor. The phone still works to this day and I've had this issue twice. It's been two weeks since it's happened though! Overall it's been a great phone so far and I am very pleased I got it. Good luck:)"
"Apple",5,"phone was ordered on a Saturday was at my door with fedex on Tuesday..... shipping estiment on Amzon automated was 45+days I got in a toatal order to my Door in 4days........ Phone Looked light a brand new phone and by new like I payed 500+ was well worth it. love the phone all accessories were in box. Live is good!"
"Apple",1,"I purchased this iPhone because the seller said it was unlocked. Once I received it I found out it was not unlocked. I reached out to Hillside Deals twice to see what they could do about this problem. I was hoping they would still be able to unlock the phone. I did not receive any response from the seller.Amazon worked very quickly in refunding the money I paid but my issue is not completely solved because I am still without an unlocked iPhone. I live in Haiti so the process of finding, purchasing, shipping and receiving is very long. Now I have to do it all over again. Thank you Amazon for your help but I will not be purchasing anything through Hillside Deals again."
"Apple",5,"I bought and received in perfect conditions here in Brazil.It works very well and 32GB is a fantastic size to put pictures and songs..."
"Apple",5,"The phone is absolutely perfect. It was able to do everything I needed it to do plus much more. Hopefully I can find a 5 at a great price so I can upgrade"
"Apple",1,"This SELLER stated that he would give me a discount for my troubles. A discount of $10.00?? I spent that much just sending him BACK his defective iPhone. So were is my DISCOUNT?? He must really though I was a fool twice?? I may have to file in a small claims court to get a working iPhone plus a REAL DISCOUNT!!"
"Apple",1,"good afternoon my user is velis33@gmail.com I make a purchase of a 32GB iPhone 4 used the day February 15, 2014, I wonder if I'm already happened with the team why not come ah me anything yet and I waiting time"

"Apple",5,"The phone was defective, but there was great service who fixed the issue."
"Apple",1,"This phone would freeze up on me and was terribly slow. The reception was a very bad, too. This phone was running on 3g. I went back to my android phone."
"Apple",1,"avoid, not good!!!! - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -"
"Apple",5,"excelent"
"Apple",4,"This is a great item. I am pleased with the condition as well as the operation of it, however the battery reflects the age of the device. Besides the battery depleting its charge rather quickly I am happy with this phone."
"Apple",5,"Good price"
"Apple",5,"As described & in great condition"
"Apple",1,"My phone do not be quiet when it is in silent mode especially when I take a pic.in addition, they gave me low quality earphones."
"Apple",5,"The phone is in excellent condition, all features and functions work very well. Great amount of memory. Enjoying it a great deal."
"Apple",2,"I had to pay a service to unlock it. And it really took time to and money to finally fix it"
"Apple",1,"I was sold a phone by this seller under the description of ""used like new"", the package arrived before the due date which was awesome and appeared to be as described, COSMETICALLY . The next day the charger wasn't working, no big deal chargers are easy to replace. A week to the day I received the product it quit working completely. I notified the seller immediately!! He replied within 2 hours, explaining he worked in the week and would get back to me over the weekend with options of how to go about fixing the problem. Which in turn ended up in me sending a second email of which he informed me that he would not give me a refund, and offered $40 maximum... I BARLEY HAD THE PHONE A WEEK!!!!! THE PHONE WAS NOT IN WORKING CONDITIONS, AND I SPENT ALMOST $400 IN THE PRODUCT AND SHIPPING FOR A BROKEN PHONE THAT THE SELLER BELIEVES IS NOW ONLY WORTH $40!!! I AM BEYOND UPSET AND I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND THAT ANYONE MAKE A PURCHASE FROM CAM-O-RAMA WITH OUT HAVING A LEGAL REPRESENTATIVE TO LOOK FOR LOOP HOLES IN THE REFUNDING DEPARTMENT! I WILL NEVER BUY ANYTHING OFF OF AMAZON KNOWING THAT THERE IS REALLY PEOPLE LIKE THIS OUT HERE!! I read almost all the reviews and ratings before buying from this seller, as well as other sellers before making my purchase. I am now out of $400 dollars, and have a black screened iphone to show for it! THANK YOU CAM-O-RAMA!! FOR NOTHING!""Since I can only provide DOA (dead on arrival) guarantee and because the phone wasdelivered as in described condition (used but fully functional), Iwon't be able to take a full return for it. HOWEVER, I always do thebest I can to help my buyers. I would like to offer you a $40 refund..."""
"Apple",1,"I bought an annouced factory unlocked phone and I received a locked one. I won't trust anymore on the provider."
"Apple",5,"Excelente vendedor recomendado al cien porciento. Excelente equipo y excelentes precios recomiendo al 100 % sin mas que agregar. ..."
"Apple",5,"The package arrived in time and in perfect conditions! I had an awesome feed back, I completely recomend to buy with this guy!"
"Apple",1,"This product was an OLD re-built iPhone pieced together and sold for WAY too much money! I bought this product specifically for traveling overseas so I could substitute SIM cards in different countries. I had problems with it and took it into an Apple Store. They examined it and said the serial number had been changed as well as the components. I had to buy a REAL iphone from them. The warranty period was very short but I plan to discuss this with Amazon.com to see if anything can be done to refund my money.This seller is a total rip-off - don’t buy from Ross Cellular!"
"Apple",5,"I have never written a review for any product I purchased. I make an exception here because, Mr. Kyle Wunderli, of Better Deals FASTER is a preeminent businessman who has very high quality products, super fast delivery time, and superb customer skills. Although I paid a little more from this seller than from another, I would purchase from this seller again!"
"Apple",5,"Pros:Works smoothly with 99% apps.(Surprisingly Subway Surfer lags sometimes while Temple Run 2 works flawlessly. Maybe some coding problem)High pixel density makes the watching movies and reading books a joy.No bloatware unlike most Android phones.Camera works great in well-lit conditions.Touch is really smooth.Build quality is amazing and phone feels premium in one's hand.Battery lasts over a day with moderate usage (1/2 hour calling, 1 hour gaming, 1 hour video)Cons:Can't share files over bluetooth.Price/Screen size ratio is much larger compared to Android phones.Slightly heavy."
"Apple",5,"item is the same as described. i'm very satisfied. deliver even on Christmas holidays, which surprise me. full points to me!!!"
"Apple",4,"Very good phone and well maintained. Except for one issue i.e. back button was not quickly responding other things were near perfect."

"Apple",5,"I had to return it, because it would not work with Tracfone. It did not have cdma protocol required by Tracfone. The phone itself was in perfect condition, and I hated to part with it."

"Apple",5,"The phone was great and as it said in the decription I loved it and it did really save me a trip to the store!!!!!!"
"Apple",5,"Good"
"Apple",5,"I received the product according. It was delivered on time and I am very satisfied. Very good deal!"
"Apple",5,"It came out really good like how it was shown in the images and in the details and what comes with the only one thing was that wen I got it didn't look clean it had some dirt but that wasn't a problem it was easy to take off but other than that 👏"
"Apple",4,"Very good"
"Apple",5,"I bougth it used and works good excellent"
"Apple",5,"love it."
"Apple",5,"Good phone and came unlocked"
"Apple",5,"I have had I phones 4s before and feel one of the best models Apple had made. This phone was in great shape while looking so slick. The seller had described the phone exactly the way it is and I'm very happy with my purchase"
"Apple",5,"Very good for 80$"
"Apple",4,"Great, ipod slah phone I like this phone but bought it used unlocked after sprint chose not replace my iPhone 6+ after nearly drowning lol but this phone after having the 5 the 6+ is very good , it just reminds me of ipod the thickness. the service I got from the seller was excellent offering to replace it because the home button was not responding and the flash light didn't work at all. but they suggested to put rubbing alcohol inside it, I didn't but out of no where the home button just started responding the flash light works so now I can say for 80$ the phones worth not paying 250 a month."
"Apple",3,"This phone does not ring at all"
"Apple",5,"Just what the hubs needed."
"Apple",5,"When you have someone who doesn't use their Android phone go to actually using their phone to stay in touch .. that's a good thing"
"Apple",5,"Great chance to get a teens first iPhone!"
"Apple",5,"I loved"
"Apple",3,"Bought two of them. The first one you have to push the middle button a few times to get it to work. The second one was ok, but the volume seems to mess up on it a lot."
"Apple",1,"Primero lo evalue bien, luego el Telefono empezo a fallar, se quedaba paralizado y el boton de comando dejo de Funcionar. Para mi sorpresa, la Apple me informa que el Telefono ya habia sido reparado antes y que no tiene garantia. Perdi mi dinero!!! No lo compren!First it evaluates fine, then the phone started to fail, he stayed paralyzed and the left command button to Run.To my surprise, Apple informs me that the phone had already been repaired before and has no warranty. I lost my money! Do not buy"
"Apple",1,"The accessories were not original and the phone got damaged a week after I bought it.The customer service was fine though."
"Apple",5,"The product was shipped very fast and arrived in mint conditions excellent service And every thing was exactly as described"
"Apple",1,"When I got the package everything looked all right, but appearances can be deceiving. The USB connector would not accept any cable, just the one shipped inside. This is weird, but I could live with that glitch. Then, 2 weeks later, I noticed that all pictures taken with the front camera got blured and the 5M Pixels back camera had some issues in focusing the image.After 2 months using, I figured some extra bad surprises. The front speaker just went dead 3 days ago, the phone wont ring or produce any sound anymore!!!! Also, there is something wrong with the earphone jack as well, because during song playing we can hear ""pops"" and sudden pauses, just like in vynil players. Moreover, the ""Face Proximity Sensor"" never worked, but I didnt even know it exists, so I could not find out sooner.I took it to an Apple authorized Repair Shop, and to my surprise I was informed that identified that the iPhone was refurbished with a lot of low quality spare parts, including the cameras (back and front ones), and even the front touch screen glass!!I have no doubt that the phone was not ""Very good"" as advertised. Not at all!! I payed a good money for it, and will cost me a lot of extra money to repair it, which is not acceptable."
"Apple",5,"Very Amazing Phone. I can't believe the phone was 32GB and Factory Unlicked and I paid less than a Brand New locked 8Gb phone. This is a much better deal and I returned the new iPhone I ordered previously, Thank You Very Much For This Amazing Deal I Love Amazon And Bayshine Inc.!!! :D heck ya!"
"Apple",5,"Todo muy bien. Me gusto... Fue lo que pedi... llego a tiempo... Excelente, recomendando 100%...Saludos desde Valencia - Venezuela..."
"Apple",4,"All I can say is that this is a great product and works propertly. It arrived on time! I am so happy with this purchase."
"Apple",1,"Check out this facebook page that outlines their shady business practices: [...]The 1-star rating is not for the iphone itself - that would be a 5-star. The 1-star rating is for the seller - WIREOVIAI bought this in March 2012, seeing that it was ""Factory Unlocked by Apple, Never Opened"" and ""New In Shrink-Wrap and Original Packaging"".Just yesterday, a little over 2 months of having the phone, the speaker stopped working so I bring it into Apple, thinking it would be covered under warranty.The apple employee informs me that the iphone was owned and registered in September 2010 - 17 months before I bought this ""new"" iphone.Do not buy ANYTHING from this vendor - WIREOVIA - as you cannot trust the authenticity of what they're selling! What you buy would also not be covered under the manufacturer's warranty if it's older than you think it is. You will just end up with a useless, piece of junk and less several hundred dollars."
"Apple",1,"""I've had the MOST FRUSTRATING experience with this seller in my life. I wouldn't actually leave any stars for them, just had to. This was iPhone 4s box, the bottom of the which was roughly sealed with some dirty paper to cover the real specks, it was blocked and 16 GB instead of 32 GB. Moreover, the seller wouldn't confirm the return of this product despite my 2 emails to them. I do not recommend anyone to do business with this seller ever!!!"""
"Apple",1,"The phone looked good when I opened it but once I started using it I felt that some part of the touch screen is not recognizing the taps. I tried several tests to ensure the problem and finally I went to apple website and follow the resolution but for no improvement. But when I tried to enter the serial no and seek help from Apple specialists system denied saying 'Service coverage expired' where as I am supposed to get 1 yr warranty as per the seller commitment.I looks like although this is claimed as New, it is a replaced/refurbished phone. I felt very sad and need to return it."
"Apple",4,"Nice phone"
"Apple",5,"Brilliant!"
"Apple",5,"excellent"
"Apple",5,"tow years and still working was in perfect shape great"
"Apple",5,"very good"
"Apple",5,"An upgrade for me from a 3GS. So happy I made the move. This phone is wonderful!"
"Apple",1,"The Iphone has minor scratches as described.Unfortunately,the item is not even recognized by my Mac Book Pro ,when I connect to the usb port.When I turn the phone and insert the SIM,it's asking me for a code.The phone is blocked, and locked and I am not able to use it.I am really devastated by this situation."
"Apple",1,"Bought2 of these through Vantage Cellular. The phones were wrapped like new. Looked great. All appeared good. Then little things were noticed. When the screen went black I would see phantom keyboard characters throughout the screen. Similar to how monitors react if the same picture stays on too long and the pixels freeze, same thins with this. I was supposed to get iPhone 4S', not 4's. I even verified the link after purchase and it showed up 4S. Now I had a problem with one phone not turning on and just a black screen. Was told it was the battery, when the phone was opened to replace said battery, low and behold - These aren't real iPhones. So now my ordered iPhone 4S' turn out to be fake iPhone 4's. Will will say 'return them and why did you not send them back right away?' Well, I work overseas and was only home to pick them up for a very short time and returning them was out of the question as the phones were needed when I returned. So how do we fix this? Stay tuned and I will update this as things unfold."
"Apple",5,"Good phone, few issues with software. songs just break or dont play. overall good phone"
"Apple",3,"The phone is in great condition and it works perfectly fine"
"Apple",5,"I bought this used and i was really nervous because it was such a huge purchase. NEXTDAYTECH really took care of me. props to them. the phone is exactly like they described and they gave me a wall adaptor and charger"
"Apple",1,"The main reason I did not like this product is that from the time it arrived it did not work properly. The docking charging slot was misaligned as were the screws holding it in place. I damaged 2 charging cables trying to use it. When I could finally take it to mu apple dealer he looked up the serial and discovered that it was in reality a used phone purchased over a year before whose warranty was expired. amazon stood by its warranty and refunded me but it was a hassle for me because I live outside the usa and am now trying to get a replacement for my phone. I will never knowingly buy from these folks again"
"Apple",3,"After saving up for several months, I was able to purchase my very first high-end phone. At the time I first bought this phone, it was still considered out of date, but I didn't care. I was very excited to finally have an all in one high quality music player, cell phone, and handheld computer. I remember being most excited, besides the app inclusions, that this product had 32 whole gb to play with. That was more than I'd ever had in my mp3 players/ ipods of the past.Pros-Huge GB Space-App Store-High quality music playback (However, I believe the Sansa line of Mp3 players has a much better quality of music playback and higher volume offering. This is the only one I have found.)-Glass pieces rather than plastic-Unlocked for use with multiple phone servicesCons-Buggy at times-Outdated-Does not support many apps-New OS does not run very smoothly on this-One speaker was busted-Grossly overpriced-You can find an Andriod that improves on this system in every way for a quarter of the priceI have since updated to a less expensive Android phone with expandable memory (LG K700) as even the cheap ones run better OS than this old thing nowadays. For the time though, this piece of software was very innovative and very exciting to have. If you are in the market for a new phone, I would recommend a newer piece of equipment though, rather than springing for this item, even if it is the Apple Store you are looking for. Many apps do not even run on this any longer. A new andriod would save your pocket some dough, and offer you higher improvements."
"Apple",3,"The deal sounds amazing but the home button is really hard to press to work. The heat plate and screws aren't on the inside so you will have poor wifi connection."
"Apple",5,"The quality of the phone was better than expected, I was skeptical at first if it would be actually unlocked, but so far so good."
"Apple",5,"The phone was new in the box withe manufacturer films, totally unlocked, working perfect. The iPhone is the best phone, no doubts apart that. The shipment was delivered previous to the delivery date, and apart form the phone the seller send me for free, 2 rubber cases, a set of screen protection and a car charger in addition to the wall charger. Everything Perfect!! Thank you!"
"Apple",1,"because the iphone is fiddled, and has many damaging and this product is not fit for the work he cheatDishonest seller and I have sold my iPhone 4 32 GB and has many malfunction in the device like Sbakr and headsets and order"
"Apple",5,"the best service i ever have The phone is look and act like new.If this site have something you need get it very profecional. Thanks"
"Apple",3,"But I request Iphone 4 32GB and we send me 16GB. but the telephone is 100% new. with all accessories."
"Apple",3,"The phone itself is in good condition and works well. It does, however, have 3 small scratches on the screen that are highly visible. They did not emphasize this in the description. They also said they'd send a USB charger, which they did, but it is old, gross, and the inside wires are exposed and taped together. Totally unacceptable. I bought another iPhone 4 from a different seller and it was exactly as it was described. Needless to say, I was very happy with the other seller. Maybe this seller can learn to do more honest business like them."
"Apple",2,"Appearance very good. This product initially worked OK but soon started dying suddenly, would not stay charged. Battery probably was not good and needs to be replaced. I was mostly disappointed because I bought this for my son & should've tried to return it as soon as it started giving him trouble."
"Apple",1,"The calling started glitching after a week and noone can hear me on the other line, alot of bugs and problems, starting to become real slow also"
"Apple",1,"Apple no longer supports this product, and it cannot be updated to the latest iOS. Buyer beware."
"Apple",1,"Never buy from Next Gen Wireless.The phone I got had a broken receiver and I could only listen to phone calls on speaker phone. I had to return the phone after spending hours looking online for solutions and trying to figure out what the problem was. When I contacted them about the problem and returned it, they said they would 'have their technicians inspect it' before refunding the money. The phone most definitely did not work and they got back to me saying that their technicians couldnt find anything wrong with the phone and that they would refund me, but charge me a ""restocking fee"" since the phone was now ""used.""On top of that, they sent me fake headphones and a fake charging cord. Apple blocks unauthorized lightning cords and when I finally gave up with the phone and went to back it up before returning it, the cord never worked, never charged the phone, and couldnt form a connection with my itunes. The battery life on the phone was also practically nothing which leads me to believe the phone was either also fake or used/refurbished. Either one sucks since I paid for what was listed as a new phone and ended up paying them to take it back ""used"" - probably to sell it to someone else new again.If I could I would give 0 stars. This is a bs product from a bs company with terrible customer service and service, period."
"Apple",5,"works great everything exactly as advertised thank you"
"Apple",3,"Ok"
"Apple",5,"very good"
"Apple",1,"the phone did not last for even two weeks before it developed a fault"
"Apple",1,"They told me this one new. But this old.don't give me charger and semi open pin."
"Apple",4,"good"
"Apple",5,"Got the item out by the time it was suppose to be deliver, the saying you pay what you get for applies here. I was looking so hard for a white iphone and couldn't find one at a reasonable price so I went ahead and order the black one new and I got a white one same gbs and all just the color was different and I was very satisfied with the product no bad experience so far."
"Apple",3,"El equipo llego bien, mas tuve que pagar una alta suma para que lo pudieran desbloquear. no vino desbloqueadode fabrica como decía el anuncio."
"Apple",4,"I like it very much because it is user friendly and I like taking lots of pictures of my family and friends."
"Apple",5,"excellent product. great conditions. just as described on article. works great with my actual carrier here in my country (venezuela)"
"Apple",2,"Seller promised to send unlocked iPhone and sent AT&T locked phone also the screen was broken when I received it.I had to spend more amount to get the screen fixed and now I am struggling to get the iPhone unlocked."
"Apple",5,"Works great, I recomend you to buy reburbished. I have been in the industry for years and I bought this Iphone and it's flawless, fast shipping also. Thank you!"
"Apple",1,"The iphone broke the first day i used it. nothing of the phone was apple original.The iphone was in really bad conditions"
"Apple",2,"The phone itself was great. Until it broke (buttons stopped working) after 3 months. Then I discovered that it was out of warranty, because it was NOT new as stated.This was a ""Fulfillment by Amazon"" seller. It doesn't matter. They are no better than every other seller out there lying about their merchandise. And all Amazon can do is issue a refund."
"Apple",1,"No es confiable este proveedor de celulares, debido a que me fue enviado un celular Iphone como nuevo y fue vendido en el ano 2010 a otra persona, o sea era basura. Fui directamente a una tienda apple en Florida porque nunca sirvio y resulto ser que estaba fuera de garantia. Gracias a apple tengo un iphone"
"Apple",5,"Excelente producto, a pesar de ser usado, esta en muy buenas condiciones tanto estéticamente como funcionalmente. El teléfono es desbloqueado para todo el mundo.!!"

"Apple",5,"bought it as a present for my friend. she is happy."

"Apple",4,"Excelent Product"
"Apple",1,"They sold it as a new phone but at day 40 it stopped working. The official Apple service confirmed that the iphone was not new, but rearmed with parts from other phones and that several of them were defective.It is a shame that mislead buyers this way. Do not buy this kind of phone."
"Apple",5,"llego en excelentes condiciones a venezuela, es liberado, funciona con digitel movistar y movilnet, tal cual lo describian en la paginaarrived in excellent condition Venezuela, is released, works with movistar and movilnet digitel, described it as such on page"

"Apple",5,"excelente vendedor desde venezuela todo perfecto gran telefono sin detalle alguno llego en el tiempo estimado en excelentes condiciones gracias"
"Apple",1,"This phone broke after 5 weeks the microphone quit working and I needed a working phone that day, I had to bring it to Apple, they gave me a new phone for $150, so add this to the $300 I paid for this phone so I got a brand new factory unlocked 32 GB iPhone 4 for $450 which is ok."
"Apple",1,"Purchased I Phone 4 32 GB Factory Unlocked everything was working well the first day! Product came in the mail over to Italy where I am stationed in 5 days! Which is real fast! While I was sleeping Voice Control started to come on and off by itself and not to mention the home button stops working as well! I tried to to restore it but the phone keeps going back to recovery mode!"
"Apple",1,"I received yesterday, when I installed the simm (wich is working on other unlocked iphone 4 32gb), I realized that it is not unlocked, because the simm is invalid. I need as urgent to solve this problem. Please help me !!!!!"

I received my phone today and it is perfect there is NO damage and it works perfectly. Thank you so much for the great experiance!!"
"Apple",1,"No, they didn't meet my expectation. I ordered an original Samsung galaxy S4 and they sent me a fake one in a foreign language!"
"Apple",5,"Love it now that my work mates can text me for any shift changes or new shift been added into work schedule"
"Apple",4,"Good"
"Apple",5,"My iPhone is amazing and worked right away! Thanks so much for the instructions in the box too. Look forward to doing business with you again!!!!"
"Apple",1,"Mic not working"
"Apple",2,"the front button does not work."
"Apple",2,"Good phone but when you call someone or get a call you can't talk in the phone. The person on the other line can't hear you."
"Apple",4,"good received"
"Apple",5,"It was exactly what I wanted. I am very pleased."
"Apple",1,"bulls***"
"Apple",4,"Very clean product two thumbs up."

"Apple",1,"Horrible. Guy scammed me. Could barely hear the person you were talking to."
"Apple",5,"GOOD PHONE I BuY tow times"
"Apple",5,"Item as advertised delivered promptly and securely... 5 stars!!!"
"Apple",1,"The phone shuts itself off even when the battery isn't dead. The battery dies in less than two days even with NO use! It's supposedly new in the box and that appeared to be true but it seems we will have to replace the battery. Not sure if it was a good price after all."
"Apple",5,"I have been using the cell phone for 1 month and it is working very good, i would definetely recomend it , just you need to know that this kind of apple cell phone doesnt work with sprint, verizon and METROPCS but with T Mobile and AT & T works good."
"Apple",5,"Great"
"Apple",5,"This is exactly the Iphone that I need, especially if I will travel international. I love it."
"Apple",5,"Your product is very good I recommend other customer to buy your product you exceed my expectation."
"Apple",2,"The product was fake"
"Apple",2,"As stated in the description, the iPhone had little to no scratches around the phone. Good Job here. After turning it on, here's where the problems began to stir up. Due note that I previously owned a 4s prior and only ordered this one because I loved the phone, lost the phone and thought I'd try another one.Music - I'm a BIG fan of music. With this phone, I am not able to play music, smoothly from Tune In as once before. The issue starts whenever I have Wifi and Carrier service on at the same time. Never a problem with prior.GMaps + Music - Normally, I could listen to music while getting directions from GMaps. With this phone, every turn-by-turn direction causes my music to stop completely and I have to press play in order to start the music again. Never a problem with prior.Home Double-Tap Button - When I attempt to use this feature to navigate through opened apps, it would work about 1 out of 5 tries. Never a problem with prior.Wifi On/Off - Normally, I could turn my wifi on/off, interchangeably, between use with apps and never had a problem; however, apps recognize that the wifi is off and only consider this the designated source for data transfer. To fix, I've had to turn the phone off completely for it to refresh. Never a problem with prior.I am currently in the process of returning this phone, for they have a 90 Day Return policy. Fingers are crossed to see if I get a better replacement.Hopefully this review has helped make a decision for you in the future."
"Apple",5,"A+++"
"Apple",5,"EXCELLENT!"
"Apple",4,"When I bought this phone, it arrived packaged as new, and it worked and looked fine with no problems. However, it came with iOS 7.1.1, which is rather confusing since that OS came out more than 2 years after the phone did. When I questioned the seller about it, they said that it was updated by Apple before they liquidated the phone off to the seller. Since I had specifically wanted it to have the original iOS, I returned it without any hassle.TL;DR - If you want the original iOS, don't buy this phone."
"Apple Computer",1,"It can't hold a charge at the most for 6 hrs...very unhappy with it."
"Apple Computer",1,"This phone was advertised as unlocked when that was not the case. I am with provider AT&T and they stated it was a locked phone and it couldn't be activated. Now I am stuck with a phone that will never be activated, and I'm afraid to purchase a phone through amazon again."
"Apple Computer",5,"Great purchase. Works just fine and US Cellular figured out how to get it working with my account. The clerks didn't know how to activate, not the seller's fault. Excellent phone, highly recommend doing business with this merchant."
"Apple Computer",5,"I love my new phone I usually go for Samsung or Lg but I think I will but using IPhone from now on"
"Apple Computer",5,"Got my first Iphone and nothing wrong with it and I love it!"
"Apple Computer",5,"Just what we needed - thanks!"
"Apple",5,"PERFECT!!!!"
"Apple",1,"Charge does not last. Will never buy from this person again."
"Apple",5,"Works great. Fast shipping."
"Apple",4,"The 4s is technically obsolete but works well for me at this price."
"Apple",4,"Nice"
"Apple",4,"Good"
"Apple",5,"I didn't have any problem to activate it and works great it was a great buy to me thanks!"
"Apple",5,"Everything was great works and looks great shipping was fast"
"Apple",4,"I got this phone as a birthday present for my mother. The phone arrived on time and came exactly as described. We are very pleased so far."
"Apple",5,"Phone works great had it for over year now would buy from them again"
"Apple",3,"I got my iPhone about a month ago, and it looked fantastic! But when I tried charging it, it literally took the whole day to get to a hundred percent. It kept switching from the bolt, to the plug symbol. This made me mad. But when I just plugged it into the computer, it took about eh, a good hour or so to fully charge. So just last night I realized that it wasn't my phone that was acting up, it was the plug that was broken. Luckily I have an old plug I can use and now it works perfectly fine."
"Apple",5,"When I ordered it I was scared that it wouldn't come in. which, the phone came in. It is in PERFECT condtion. it's been a month. and I LOVE IT SO MUCH!!"
"Apple",2,"Not upto the mark..as they mentioned in portal....phone is not that good....so next time please give correct information about the products so that customers will no confuse....anyway its ok. my fault..:)"
"Apple",2,"After I received this phone, I give it to my daughter for use and surprise, the phone was locked. I contacted the vendor to resolve the problem but I've never got a positive reply or resolution. We ended by paying more money to unlock the phone."
"Apple",5,"phone arrived exactly when they said and it was better than expected!!! No problems connecting to sprint. Very happy customer"
"Apple",5,"The phone Came in time and was able to go to the sprint store and he was able to get ever thing working on the phone and be able to use it right off the bay the phone come with ever thing and it looked like it was brand new !"
"Apple",3,"The product what I Received looks great but with no packaging and no charger, and I don't know if this product was originally like this."
"Apple",5,"I got the phone a perfect time and the phone is as mention, ver good, works perfect no problemsthank you"
"Apple",5,"The phone was as described it was kept in very good conditions all its functions work properly and the best thing about it is it came super early so thanks man"
"Apple",2,"I ASK FOR A UNLOCKED IPHONE 4S WHITE, BUT I RECEIVE A LOCKED IPHONE 4S BY SPRINT LOCKED, WHEN THE ADD SAID FABRIC UNLOCKED, IT WAS A UNLOCKED IPHONE PRICE BUT IT WAS NOT UNLOCKED, SO I AM VERY DISSAPOINTED. AFTER ALL THAT HAD HAPPEN TO GET IT, IT WAS NOT WHAT I EXPECTED."
"Apple",2,"The amount of gigs advertised is a lie. Don't quote me.. but i'm pretty sure mine might have had some sort of malware or virus pre installed on it.p.s. I could be wrong.But from now on i'm going directly to the nearest apple store."
"Apple",5,"MET ALL EXPECTATIONS."
"Apple",5,"phone was in great shape"
"Apple",1,"Charger wa in pieces"
"Apple",5,"It took a little longer than I would expect an Amazon item to arrive, but the phone was perfect!"
"Apple",5,"Would buy it again if I do need another one later. Looked practically brand new and worked very well but saved a ton of money."
"Apple",5,"excellent"
"Apple",2,"Battery problems"
"Apple",1,"It didn't. The microphone doesn't work.I have to use head phone all the time."
"Apple",4,"I lost my good phone while on vacation and needed a temporary one until I hit my upgrade period. This phone was in good condition and works. It is obviously and old model, but I had no issues activating it on my own. The battery life is OK, maybe a day with light usage, but this must be expected when buying an old phone."
"Apple",5,"Great phone. I would recommend it to any one who's looking for a I phone to buy."
"Apple",4,"Great condition for the price its super slow compared to the new iPhones but does the job"
"Apple",3,"Not a bad phone at all, except it stops vibrating for texts or other notifications every now and then. I even made sure the vibration was activated for the phone. But other than that it's alright."
"Apple",1,"Fast shipping, in great condition but it was locked out and I tried everything I could to unlock it not seemed to work"
"Apple",3,"Great phone ,however , it's not connected with Sprint as advertised. Therefore ,its not sprint ! So the best option in buying a expensive Apple iPhone u must make sure that it can advertised as a sprint phone ."
"Apple",2,"The phone came in great condition and on time, I was relived thinking I would be able to activate this phone with my current sprint account and turns out it is NOT locked to sprint. So if you are a sprint costumer I highly suggest you not waist your time and money on purchasing this phone. If you are a Verizon costumer then you can use this phone because my sprint carrier said this phone was with Verizon."
"Apple",3,"Works as expected."
"Apple",4,"My phone works great, it's definitely a little slower on the touch screen feature than a new phone but I have had no other issues with it."
"Apple",5,"So far it seems to be a great phone for that generation. It came to us with the tiniest of tiny scratches on the face so that is awesome for a recycled phone. It works great."
"Apple",5,"Awesome phone, exactly as described. Looked brand new, came with upgraded charger. I would buy from this company again."
"Apple",1,"First phone didn't recognize at times during the day that it had a battery at all. The second phone's ear speaker didn't work. Tired of paying $35 to have phone number moved to the next phone"
"Apple",1,"Worst cell phone ever. It has all kinds of problems including all the basics. It drops calls all the time by just turning itself of. It can't be turned of at all. And the seller won't communicate with me about these problems. Don't buy anything here!"
"Apple",5,"Came with everything it needs. Headphones and charger. Works great and compatible to connect with sprint with ease."
"Apple",4,"Great price, and great condition. The only problem, and nothing to do with the product, is that the 4S doesn't work too well with the current Apple OS, so it was super sluggish. But besides that, loved the purchase, and served as the perfect backup phone for when my main phone takes an unexpected vacation into the toilet."
"Apple",3,"Did not work"
"Apple",4,"They didn't tell my the speaker doesn't work. I was very disappointed but it's been almost 2 years, and I still have it."
"Apple",1,"Not locked to sprint."
"Apple",1,"the item i purchased was stolen"
"Apple",1,"I needed an iPhone in a short time frame, so I ordered one via Amazon Prime. Item was described as functional working condition and in acceptable cosmetic appearance. So, my expectations were low but I didn't need anything pretty. Upon receipt, the iPhone was filthy with built up grime in all crevices and there was yellow discoloration one side of the screen most likely due to screen replacement. However, this was just the beginning before I noticed the functional issues. For work, I use speaker phone frequently, so the broken speaker and mic was a disappointment. Then, I noticed the battery was draining far too quickly. The battery was bad. I tried to pick up a deal and I got a complete lemon. You may get a good phone, but you're rolling the dice."
"Apple",5,"This product exceeded my expectations. I am happy I bought it."
"Apple",5,"The phone came in great condition! I got it as if it were brand new. It's works great as well. Satisfied customer"
"Apple",2,"No cracks or anything but the microphone is all screwed up (Siri doesn't understand comands, facetime can't hear me, video doens't record sound/very very very faint) they sent me a new one (after i had to pay return shipping) pretty confident they sent me the same phone cause it has the same problemThey told me to send it back for a refund if i wanted but my other one is destroyed so I am just sucking it up, but either way I wouldn't buy it from these people (get what you pay for)"
"Apple",4,"Love my new Apple iPhone 4S. The phone came as almost brand new and I was able to go to the local Sprint store to get it activated within five minutes with no problems! Also, the accessories such as the headphones and charger are working brand new as well. Definitely got my money's worth. Thank you Amazon!"
"Apple",5,"even nicer than the rating, works perfect, will buy and sell my phones through amazon from now on"
"Apple",4,"My son is happy with the phone and I'm happy with shipping time"
"Apple",5,"Delivery took six days. That was as expected and described. The phone is new and sealed in the box. Be sure to get and use a gel case because it inhibits dents and cracks. We do love it."
"Apple",5,"Work as expected"
"Apple",3,"Its ok"
"Apple",5,"Expectations Met.."
"Apple",5,"Good transaction ! Very happy with the phone"
"Apple",5,"Phone is working great!"
"Apple",1,"takes a full charge but dies at 50%. not very happy"
"Apple",5,"Nice replacement phone for my son."
"Apple",4,"I brought this for my girlfriend and she loves the phone. I don't like Apple I prefer Samsung but she like this product!"
"Apple",1,"Many problems with this phone. I connected to my account and it showed up as a white iPhone but it is black. Then it would not connect to Sprint which it says it is locked to Sprint, but the only networks available were ATT and TMobile. Since this was my second time attempting to buy an iPhone from Amazon for my daughter's birthday (4/1) and it still didn't work, I said forget it. So now my daughter uses two phones, one for calling and one for FaceTime but only on wifi."
"Apple",1,"was not locked to Sprint as stated"
"Apple",3,"It was as described but did not have 16gb when recieved"
"Apple",1,"Good morning the phone iphone 4s low order 116-6256512-7837051 informron me was new and wine used too is recaienta the battery lasts 20 minutes if you do not really feel cheated by this acquisition as it is not expected and can not I enjoy it I want to solve this problem because as I said I feel cheated, give me back the money by gift card to buy another phone if it gets to that price."
"Apple",2,"Didn't know the lock screen did not work, and the wrong CMDA/GSM was listed"
"Apple",1,"This phone did not hold a charge and when I did charge it, it was very hot to the touch and I could not hold it to my ear. I have returned it and waiting for a refund."
"Apple",4,"i placed the order and two days later i received it. kind of sketchy though because it was wrapped in three plastic bags and put into a box. the phone however is in great condition. i hope it wasnt stolen lol"
"Apple",5,"He was fast and the phone was exactly the way he posted and the phone could not had been no better look brand new ... Was very happy from buying from him once I got it. Before I got It, i was a little scared he said no refunds or return once I brought, so as soon as I saw that my mind was every where but the phone was good no problems and I love the iphone I'm using it now for this review."
"Apple",5,"Fast, sleekefficientworks well in NYC on the sprint networkSolid phoneresponsive and compactVery happy with it"
"Apple",5,"My daughter just love her gift. Not an apple fan but the price was good. Also got the 5 for my son."
"Apple",4,"bought for my daughter she loves loves phone,looks great no scratches perfect condition...gave 4 stars because came with no charger"
"Apple",5,"Great product. Replaced my android eve which I grew to not being able to stand. The iPhone has no problems other than it being a little more user friendly."
"Apple",4,"I Really like the phone. Seri isn't as helpful as I would like but over all the phone is great. The Picture on it is very clear"
"Apple",3,"Product is good, works fine, but I decided to stay with AT&T and this is a Sprint. I asked for an exchange or to return it and no one replied to me. So just make sure its exactly what you need and hope nothing changes because you're stuck with it, reguardless of what policy is stated"
"Apple",1,"I ended up returning the phone! I ordered an iPhone 4S for a sprint! When I got it, it was for a Verizon phone! Also, the lock button didn't work, and then the back kept slipping off, and lastly at the bottom of the screen it looked funky! I was frustrated cuz I was gonna give it as a gift to my fiancée :( I emailed the seller, and asked about it, and they told me (check this out) they told me that somewhere (which I couldn't find!) that it said in the description not compatible with Sprint!! What?!?!! It was advertised as a Sprint phone! Anyways, the person started to argue with me and told me that I was wrong! Nice! Anyways... I returned it, and I got my money back, so I thank them for that... Never going to buy from them again!"
"Apple",5,"It came with its original packaging earphones charger.Great condition no scratches no dents and works perfect!I love it!"
"Apple",5,"the phone works great it is definitely in perfect conditions it has great speed and all the functions i need"
"Apple",5,"It's an iPhone, I think everyone knows what to expect. Always make sure you can verify it's a clean ESN with Sprint of course... Seller was awesome."
"Apple",1,"If you notice the customer feedback on rob's house of good times is NOTHING but negative. The seller is claiming to offer products, but in reality has no intention whatsoever on providing them. The seller just collects the money from the buyers, and hopes that they do not notice and/or care enough to file a claim and get a refund. I am glad I went through Amazon, so I know I am protected…but I am very upset with how much of an inconvenience this has been. If only I had read all the feedback before placing my order with this person."
"Apple",4,"the iphone is great. the only problem i had was the fact that the charger wasnt working. luckily, i had my ipods charger and that worked for it. overall i highly recommend it"
"Apple",2,"i have bought a IPHONE 4S and cheeped to Angola, but unfortunatly i cannot use it because its locked and came with a sprint sim nº ICC ID8901010 / 018633051660F card, according to Sprint assistant this a stolen IPHONE and cannot be unlocked.Please revert ASAP"
"Apple",1,"The iPhone does not work. My service provider could not activate it because it still had an account associated to the serial number of the phone. I purchased as refurbished. While the phone may work (I really don't know because it can't be activated. The seller has been contacted and has not contacted me to resolve the problem. Why? I don't know other than they are not reputable, unprofessional, and could care less about their customers. Either way I would highly recommend Amazon remove them as a seller on their website. I am very disturbed and dissatisfied that I could be ignored as a customer and shown no respect about this issue. I will certainly pass this experience on to others, many others. I hope Amazon can lean on them to do what is right. A $330 rip-off is completely unacceptable for any so called, wanna be, legitimate company. I hope u can syndicate my feedback and get it to the right people!"
"Apple",4,"The phone arrived as promised and packaged well. It did appear to be a new phone complete with charger and ear buds. The curious part came when I tried to activate it. Went online at Sprint and entered the activation number that I found on the sticker on the outside of the box. The system would not take it. After three tries I was connected to a chat line. I was asked to once again enter the number and it was once again rejected. I was told to turn on the phone and check the number stored in the phone. I did and found it was different than the number on the box. When we entered that number the activation was completed.So I was just curious why a new phone would come in a box that had different activation numbers. Otherwise, 5 stars."
"Apple",1,"I lost my money by buying this phone!!!!!I did not understand it was a locked phone!!!I live in Brazil and here there dont have SPRINT!It was the worst purchase of my life!!Is standing there in the drawer, serves no!!"
"Apple",1,"I received a Verizon phone not to mention it was used!In the description it says new!!Not used I did not pay $400 dollars for this!I contacted the sell and amazon!The seller sent me a returning label on Friday and I sent it back Friday so it should be there on Tuesday!I just want my phone I orders already! My Sprint iPhone 4S 16gb! New!!! They better send it to me with in this week like they said they were!I am outraged.Amazon on the other hand said if they don't they'll have to take matters in there own hands.I just want my phone! They should send me a free case or something now for there mistake! Mad...mad...mad.."
"Apple",5,"LOVE the 4s compared to the 5. Phone was practically brand new without a blemish on it. Long time Android user and am happy having made the switch."
"Apple",4,"works awesome"
"Apple",5,"Our first smart phones. New as advertised. They arrived in sealed original packages. Activated them on our Ting account online in just a few minutes. We like them very much. A bit of a learning curve for a couple of 65 year olds used to flip phones. But we are learning and best of all our kids have quit bugging us about our old flips."
"Apple",5,"From a long time Droid user, I can say that I have overcome my fear of the iPhone and now prefer it over other phones. I used to be a diabolical hater of this phone, along with my friends Craig, Rob, and Stephen. Who would have thought they would hate Apple stuff?? I thought all liberals yearned for the day they could lick the sweat from Steve Jobs sack (metaphorically speaking of course). Anyway I broke away from the thought process that had been embedded in my mind since my childhood about iPhones and decided to try them out. Much to my surprise, they are pretty cool. Maybe one day the other guys will come around, if I can ever get them to give up on this human centipede thing they've been trying to do with each other.Overall review: 5 stars. I'd buy again."
"Apple",1,"Supposedly new - didn't work"
"Apple",1,"Do not buy. Phone can't be activated"
"Apple",5,"👍"
"Apple",2,"really slow software just lagging and freezes, also dies at 20% battery, sometimes 30%."
"Apple",5,"This is a great phone at a great price!! I highly recommend it!!"
"Apple",4,"The phone worked fine. It shall be used as an Itouch and not an Iphone. There was a small blemish on it. It was the best value for what I was looking for."
"Apple",5,"the best"
"Apple",5,"Love it!! Not a single scratch on there & I got 2 free cases from the company just for buying a phone! Highly recommend!!"
"Apple",5,"Very happy about my purchase! Phone was as described, practically new, no scratches, no problems with the phone so far... 2 thumbs up AlisonSells!!"
"Apple",5,"not a sprint customer but my aunt sure liked. it was a really good purchase and very cheap i love it"
"Apple",4,"Got the item, and this one was not reported stolen. It was stated as being new on the ad, but it is not. It works, and I am happy, but considering it is used, I feel the price was a little high. Overall, I like the phone, it arrived early, it was not stolen, and it works."
"Apple",1,"Despite that the phone was in quality condition, this phone was unable to be activated on my account because it was reported as lost/stolen and can never be activated. I AM OUTRAGED! I have waited for days for this phone to get here only to realize that this was a scam. Poor choice."
"Apple",1,"The phone is locked. I can not use it.worse buy.I regret that I bought the phone I can not use it"
"Apple",5,"my last 4s iphone got stolen and I had to buy another one for as cheap as I possibly could. This was actually a good deal and they phone is ""like new"" although, I can tell it is used. Everything is working fine so far but I'm babying the phone since my last iphone experience had affected me. Anyways, great deal and I got it pretty quickly. I'd recommend it."
"Apple",1,"Apple iPhone 4S 16GB (Black) - sprint, mobile phones labeled as very really true, should be good, after the receipt of the goods found the phone glass front panel corners of serious bump sneer temporarily, over a period of time to prepare for the Apple 5now with no problems."
"Apple",1,"This is a can not insert sim activated iPhone4sUnable to activateIs lockedIs lockedIs lockedIs lockedIs lockedIs lockedIs locked"
"Apple",1,"This why people don't trust the Internet. Why do this.i just wanted a phone. Why did u have to one of those people."
"Apple",5,"everything good about the product"
"Apple",2,"Bought used and wireless function did not work."
"Apple",5,"Love it"
"Apple",5,"My first iPhone.I love it."
"Apple",5,"The phone was logged into sprint with no problems and is working great! This company was a pleasure to work with and their products are above expectations! Very pleased with this purchase."
"Apple",1,"hello.good afternoon, estimated at the time of purchase for iphone 4s I appeared at the time of purchase unlocked iphone and now appeared locket, please tell me what should I do.thack yuo"
"Apple",5,"Phone was in great shape. It started right up and the service, once transferred, was excellent."
"Apple",5,"First time user of the I-Phone, really enjoying the product, took a little time getting use to the difference between Android and the Apple. I was happy with the fast delivery time of the product and item was in good condition."
"Apple",5,"Very satisfied with the 4s - I use it on TING and my bill is 55 a month for two of us who use plenty of data, texts and minutes.Easy to setup on ting."
"Apple",5,"I recently purchased this to replace my fiance's LG G2 (screen cracked 2 times on the darn thing). The order was fulfilled by Avid Cell, and came in perfect working condition. It holds a charge, has full functionality, and looks as though it was never even used. My fiance and I are both very pleased with the purchase."
"Apple",1,"I HAD INTENDED TO USE THIS PHONE WITH BOOST MOBILE SERVICE BUT WAS TOLD THATI COULD NOT USE IT FOR ANYBODY BUT SPRINT! SO NOW I'M STUCK WITH A SPRINT PHONE AND DONT WANT A SPRINT SERVICE PLAN..."
"Apple",5,"this iphone saved my life and money as well. phone was brand new and I still have this phone. Was very pleased with this purchase and was so glad to find a new IPHONE on AMAZON for an affordabe price"
"Apple",4,"The iPhone bought was just as it was listed... Very happy with the phone but the items with the phone was a lil random"
"Apple",5,"I'm sure the mouse is very good,I use it and feel very well ,i like it very much ,I would buy it again"
"Apple",5,"Thank you! Bought for my mom as a replacement device, price was right and will hopefully hold her over until she can upgrade thanks!"
"Apple",1,"The product is not what you wanted, try to connect several times to the seller, without any success, the product had a flaw in the letter ""a"" does not work and I asked for an unlocked phone and sent me a locked phone"
"Apple",5,"I am bowled over by my phone! Not what I expected, for it arrived early, and there was not a scratch on the phone, like brand new! A pleasant surprise, thank you so much!"
"Apple",4,"Over all a very nice phone for the price. The only sign of it being used was a tiny scratch on the screen. My only issue with the phone is that the power button on the top broke within 2 weeks of me using it. I have been able to use assisted touch to still use the phone but it is rather annoying."
"Apple",3,"And the home button is crooked!!!!!!!!!!!! Are you kidding me?! The phone works just fine otherwise, but whoever refurbished this didn't bother to clean it OR put the home button back in properly. The speakers, headphone jack hole, and the charging slot are all absolutely filthy and so clogged with dust, I am surprised they even WORK."
"Apple",5,"This phone was exactly as described. It has a small chip on the top corner but you couldn't tell especially if you had a case on the phone. I had no problems contacting sprint and setting it up. Had the phone for about a year before I moved over to T-Mobile"
"Apple",5,"Very pleased with my purchase."
"Apple",1,"Totally bad experience. The phone would not activate. Apple support person did not have a clue what to do. Dont waste your time with those folks.Somewhere in the middle of trying to activate i stood up to fast and the phone was jerked out of my hand. It flew through the air and hit the tile floor where it was destroyed. This thing blew apart. Not just the glass but the body too. Also bent. Now i cant send back. Im out 75$."
"Apple",5,"great, If U are the one who sent me the meid # so I could check it with my phone carrier. U were quick, honest and we love it."
"Apple",1,"False advertisement Don't purchase. Ordered white Sprint iPhone 4s and received black Verizon IPhone 4s. Couldn't use the phone at all. Purchased for my daughters 11th birthday however had to disappoint her. Read the reviews because they are true. Now have to wait to receive my money back."
"Apple",1,"This phone is horrible it does not charge and when it is fully charged it only stays on for 15 mins plus when the phone charges it overheats....i needed this phone for work and one of my customers with a dying 5% iphone stayed charged longer than this phone on 30%"
"Apple",5,"This was my first ever Iphone purchase.I wanted to compare the difference from android to iphone. This phone in particular when I got it, I was in shock at how fast the phone was, how quick it turned on. I was able to connect to wifi faster then my current phone at the time. I bought this phone as a extra side phone for wifi use mainly only. Games etc... I well spent my moneys worth. I really did like the browser speed when you connect to the internet and get on chrome etc..The updates to the phone let you know they need to be installed, I did like that. Security on the phone i was also impressed with on locking the phone and how easy it was to set it up.Another positive I will add to this, I liked how fast the games played on this.. There were numerous games I downloaded where the speed of the phone kept up with the game. keno games got my quite a few times LOL Speed of the phone seemed to keep up also when I had more then 1 screen. At one point I had so many apps between several screens, it really did not affect the speed of the phone.It charges quite fast, even when I was using it or playing games while charging it, it charges fast! The camera was very good quality, even for a smaller camera then I am use to, takes some getting use to. Takes pictures very fast, love the quality, easy to figure it out. One of the main features I bought this for to try out was SIRI, It worked as I read as it should. You press the button ask her a question, and she really answers it! It's like another person hiding in your phone lol I will be buying another Iphone soon, They are made for quick easy access to whatever.I recommend this phone to anyone, its well made, very fast and it does last!"
"Apple",3,"The phone is fine, but they shipped it without a sim card, so I have to go and pay for one now. Thanks alot."
"Apple",4,"Good value for the money!"
"Apple",5,"Took a little while to activate but it works great and is in very good condition."
"Apple",5,"Such a great phone. Got it six months after it came out in 2012 and just upgraded to another phone a few days ago (2016). Very solid, and sturdy. I had it in a rubber case that I bought at the 99 cent store and dropped it many times but the screen never cracked. And the home button, power, volume, and vibration switch still work. Got lucky I suppose. New updates have made it slow though. I changed the battery myself twice since 2012 and it worked pretty well, lasted me all day sometimes but I only texted and used instagram/facebook/web, I didn't game. Since then I bought three of the same for my family as well. People made fun of me for having such an old, small screen, fat, phone compared to their iPhone 6s, etc. but it still works just fine. I'll miss you my sweet, fat, slow prince."
"Apple",5,"Great phone"
"Apple",1,"casi un mes y nada que llega el telefono, IRRESPONSABLES"
"Apple",4,"good"
"Apple",5,"Just as described!"
"Apple",1,"It isn't new and can't be used because it is either stolen or tied to someone who is delinquent on their account!"
"Apple",4,"It was exactly the model I wanted. But It was my mistake when I did not realize that it was not ""unlocked"" and my son could not use it where he is now living. The ""Sprint"" company does not work in the area he lives. So I returned the Iphone just for that issue. But delivery time, return was also ok. Sorry for my mistake."
"Apple",4,"The power cord was a little damaged, however, it was shipped right away and the phone condition was accurately advertised. There were no problems with getting Sprint to activate the phone for me. Overall, very pleased. I was reluctant as this was my first used phone purchase but relieved that everything turned out well."
"Apple",1,"Did not work properly. They let me return it without any problems."
"Apple",5,"A+ vendor, older but OK product"
"Apple",5,"Great shape as advertised. Like new, not a thing wrong with it."
"Apple",5,"Great for the price."
"Apple",5,"Great phone, as described!"
"Apple",4,"Everything was great! Thanks"
"Apple",5,"Product was in great condition upon arrival."
"Apple",5,"Has worked out perfectly.. since its an older model, we were worried that it might be missing some essential tasks such as a good camera.. it has been more than we expected."
"Apple",5,"Thanks"
"Apple",5,"Has been working awesome! Great phone, and wonderful customer service!"
"Apple",5,"Perfect phone... Hooked this up to my Ring+ account, no issues whatsoever. Now I have a cheap phone with a free monthly plan that works for me! Couldn't be happier. If you need a cheap plan, take a look at Ring+ and see what you think, uses the Sprint network for service."
"Apple",5,"Held all expectation"
"Apple",1,"Scratches all over the screen and it looked filthy."
"Apple",5,"EXCELENTE"
"Apple",3,"Product is okay. Was not ""Like New."" Has scratches. Everything else is working so far."
"Apple",3,"I switched from a Samsung Galaxy to this Iphone. Turns out I actually like the Galaxy better. I will say one thing, however, about the Iphone...it is much more reliable than the Galaxy. As a person who has owned several Samsung phones, believe me when I say that the Galaxy has some sort of major issue every 3-4 months. And that my cellphone carrier charges me $10 a month to send me a refurbished phone every time the Galaxy breaks. This is the main reason I switched to the Iphone."
"Apple",1,"Didn't work"
"Apple",5,"Great phone, in excellent condtion. Very happy with the purchase. I would definately do business with this seller again."
"Apple",1,"The phone keep freezing up on me so I have to go replace the phone and pay $270"
"Apple",5,"Just as described, thank you"
"Apple",5,"Great customer service. Packaged professionally, was checked for quality control. Was clear for easy Sprint set -up just as implied. Great communication when I emailed concern about it arriving when I was out of town- they hustled and got it out to me same day and I got it 3 days earlier. Awesome!"
"Apple",4,"Power button stopped work after about six months. But, my daughter love the phone."
"Apple",1,"This iphone 4S broke after 9 months of careful use. :("
"Apple",1,"First, I want to say, I ordered a Iphone 4s on Nov. 12rd but you just gave me a Iphone4."
"Apple",5,"always i was away from iphone for many years it doesn't mean that i don't like iphones but this is my first iphone and i love it"
"Apple",2,"I was expecting an iPhone 4S 16GB as the seller advertised, however, I received an iPhone 4 8GB. I was very displeased. I did not want to return it because I was going out of town during that time and returning it would have been a huge pain. However, the device I received worked perfect and although it was not what I expected, it sold it to my friend and got some of the money back. I had a horrible experience, and I do not know why they advertise something that is not true."
"Apple",5,"It was a replacement phone. I had lost my original iphone 4s and replaced it with the same model.I loved it then and I love it now. The seller delivered quickly and I am very satisfied with his service."
"Apple",4,"Most people know what the iPhone is all about, so there's no need for me to rant about the different features it has. However, what I will say that this is a true upgrade coming the Blackberry Torch 9850. I didn't upgrade because i wanted to, but because I had to. Im happy I ran into that obligation. my choice of phones was between the 4s or the 5. I wasn't eligible for an upgrade until mid June of next year I was force to buy a phone for the full price and surprisingly both the iPhone 4S and 5 were the same price (649.99+ tax). When I compared both phone, I didn't see any distinct feature(s) that the 5 had over the 4s (besides being faster and thinner) so I decided to buy the 4s from a third party (Amazon) saving me over $200. I must say I am very please with this phone. Now I see why Apply customer are nuts."
"Apple",1,"There are a few things I would like to say about this:1. This item DID NOT come in the original iPhone box.2. The charger for the iPhone DOES NOT work.3. When information from amazon was confusing at first during a chat session, the seller didn't even read the PDF file attached to a complaint including such confusing information, and I got customer service in a very rude and unpleasant attitude. I was even threatened to be reported to Amazon, situation that never happened and I have e-mails and evidence to proove it.4. I got 10 usd in reward from amazon for the whole situation, which DOES NOT compensate all I went through.Conclusion: I still have a locked phone with Sprint with a charger that doesnt work, and my problem remains unsolved.Sorry but if there was a chance to give MedMedia246 half a star or even a NEGATIVE rate i would definetely do it."
"Apple",4,"The item looks nice and compact, or maybe too compact if your hands are big....however applications are very practical and easy to learn."
"Apple",1,"the phone was unlockable...i couldnt unlock the phone and it didnt really work good. i tired almost all the ways to unlock it but it didnt work!the only way was to open a new account with sprint!...and i dont want to do that!like seriously...if i make a contract with sprint , then i can get a new iphone for almost 200$!but i paid almost 450! for a used onebad bad bad!"
"Apple",1,"Got iPhone it looked fine until after i turned it on and the set up was complete. I then found that it was someones phone, it still had all their text messages and contacts in it, all there apps, ect. I contacted Srint to find that it is not lost or stolen, and can be activated. Still, the page said new iPhone and it was not it had been activated for 4 months. For $100 dollars more I could have bought a brand new one at retail price, just be aware of what you're getting yourself into."
"Apple",1,"It is not like new , lier !!! There is a big huge scrach on the button !Lier lier lier!"
"Apple",5,"This seller was extremely helpful, and willing to put in much appreciated extra effort so that I would have my phone shipped to me quickly. I would recommend buying any product from this seller because they are trust worthy, helpful, and extremely kind. I had my phone expedited to me, and it was no hassle or argument. Everything went smoothly, and I am very, very happy!!"
"Apple",5,"why you take from my credit carte yhe amente of 360 dollarsi send to you your apple phone because this ulockedand you telle me okwahts this"
"Apple",3,"I chose 3 stars because they are new but both iphones does not have a headphone. Would be very good if they were."
"Apple",3,"Have trouble with it taking off the zagg covers(case friendly). Ones. Unfortunatly it will have to go. But i liked it , other than that."
"Apple",1,"I bought this phone considereing i could UNLOCK IT since i live in Brazil, Rio de Janeiro, and there is no SPRINT here.very sad, the phone does not activate, unless i have a sprint account."
"Apple",1,"did not work upon opening it. blamed me for it not working. had to pay for shipping back and a ""restock fee"". so I basically paid 100 for a phone that I shipped back that never worked."
"Apple",5,"the order arrived on time, the phone was in great condition, it was with the right carrier, it came in the original box with all parts included, and it had a clean esn, perfect."
"Apple",3,"The description of the phone said it was new but the box was open and the charger was used.. The phone it self looked new and it word greate!! Can complain over all.."
"Apple",5,"I bought this used for less than 300 bucks and it came with the box and accessories and was in mint condition. It was a Christmas gift so I was worried what it would look like but it looks brand new. The ESN was clean and we activated it just fine."
"Apple",5,"I just got this today and it looks brand new.Thank you so much. Nothing wrong at all with it. very clean"
"Apple",1,"The phone did not work at all. Wouldn't even turn on."
"Apple",5,"works great. arrived timely and activated no problems... thanks"
"Apple",5,"Great replacement phone! Shipment arrived on time, in excellent condition, and with all the accessories."
"Apple",5,"worked great"
"Apple",4,"My speaker at the bottom is broken and there are some chips and dings that I wasn't notified on but over all I love my new phone."
"Apple",5,"so far so good"
"Apple",4,"Has worked perfectly but did not totally seem to be ""brand new."" Appeared to be refurbished, but I have no proof of that. The phone looks great, works great. I am enjoying it immensely!"
"Apple",5,"the phone was great, in new condition, we were very pleased."
"Apple",1,"Knock off product I think. Screen seal failed shortly after purchasing and the screen protector was definitely not like past ones I bought had dots all over it"
"Apple",1,"After 6 months having to this iPhone 4s I have had to change the battery twice which was 40 dollars each time. Also have had to many over heating , speakers didn't work and had to change twice as well"
"Apple",1,"It didn't lock to Sprint."
"Apple",1,"This phone are unlocked for worldwild? I buy it and no working for Venezuela. I don't know what happened. Please answer me"
"Apple",5,"Showed up in great condition, exactly what I was expecting!"
"Apple",2,"It was not Locked to Sprint it was locked to Verizon."
"Apple",4,"I don't really care for the Apple products because they are so hard to get your account set up for the app store but my daughter thought she needed a iphone and I guess they work pretty well"
"Apple",1,"Worse"
"Apple",5,"Everything came as he said. Thank you"
"Apple",1,"Other than the fact that Sprint service is almost nonexistent where I live, the main feature that was wrong with the phone was the volume. You had to be very close to the phone in order to hear it and inerdz still made me pay to ship it back."
"Apple",4,"Great phone! Worked without issue for quite a while, eventually the screen stopped adjusting when I turn it on its side but whatever, it's an old phone at this point. Highly recommended!"
"Apple",2,"Screen scratches"
"Apple",5,"i bought my son a replacement phone and when it arrived it was in great shape, it look like a new phone."
"Apple",1,"Sprint would not activate the phone they said it was lost or stolen. The phone was in great shape when I received it, but could not be activated I looked for a phone # to call to see if I was doing something wrong but could not find one. I hope the return process goes well."
"Apple",4,"There's a little blurry spot at bottom of screen. I didn't like that being on the screen. Not perfect :-("
"Apple",2,"The iPhone was represented as used, which it was. The description did not mention the Otter commuter box which came with the iPhone, which was a nice surprise. However, the iPhone has been less reliable than my previous new phone was, although how I use the phone has not changed. I noticed the first day that the battery runs down faster, and is sometimes depleted before the day is over. A new twist is that now I cannot put some calls through. When I enter a phone number to place a phone call, the screen indicates the call is connected because the seconds are incrementing. However, I don't hear a ring or hear the receiving party. This is inconvenient for a phone. I wonder what feature will have reduced functionality next. I expected that a phone, although used, would be more reliable and that its deficits would have been clearly described in the offering information. Even on Amazon, with a highly ranked seller, buyer beware."
"Apple",1,"After having this phone activated I found it was defective, The volume was abnormally low even when turned up to the max. I took the phone in to the Sprint store and they ran a diagnostic test. They did confirm there was an issue but could not do more than a diagnostic without opening the phone. I procrastinated sending the phone back because I wanted to remove my personal data and did not receive a full refund. I won't be order a phone online again."
"Apple",1,"When I read the description, it stated that the phone would have light, minimal scratched on the screen. The front and back screen were in great condition, however, there were many more issues. The battery was toast, and shut the phone off at 20%. The metal frame is bent at the top of the phone, making it hard to use a case. The flash doesn't work. The camera has dark spots, the charger that came with the phone doesn't work. The speaker is blown, and people can't hear me. I contacted the seller, and the response was quick, but it was as useful as not contacting them at all. They offered to repair everything minus the metal frame, but I'd have to send the phone back on my dollar, and be stuck without a phone until they sent it back. Nothing else. Of course, I didn't send it back. Be very cautious when buying."
"Apple",5,"My phone works great..... I love it. I did not need an IPhone 5 , so I was pleased to get this for such a great price."
"Apple",1,"POS!!!!"
"Apple",1,"I ordered these phones for my brother and niece, and didn't realize that they have to be 'unlocked' for the particular phone service you use. I have since returned them for a refund and my brother bought the correct ones locally."
"Apple",1,"The phone is Sprint, but the SIM card tray was not from original phone. When I took it to Apple to have it activated, they used the IEMI from the SIM tray.That IEMI was from an AT&T phone, which immediately locked the phone to AT& T. They did a hard factory reset, it is still locked to AT&T. It is an expensive paperweight now. The phone was advertised to be in ""very good condition"" I would say the chipped glass corners, different SIM tray, the various scratches all over the phone, is NOT ""very good"" , maybe ""fair condition"" but no way in a ""very good condition"". The seller refused to accept that there were irregularities with the IEMI in SIM tray versus the IEMI within the phone , the quality of the phone as I stated above and he made excuses such as ""you were sent the right phone, someone switched them in the mail"". I would caution anyone purchasing a used phone, just don't! You want an iPhone that works, then please purchase a new phone that is not locked to any carrier."
"Apple",4,"my new iphone it is working great and I do not more problem whit it thank you if I see some ting better ill be by it"
"Apple",5,"the iphone is better than other。i like it ,so i advice you can change it for your new phone ,cheap and good"
"Apple",5,"I love this! Not only did the phone come so perfect, but it came in the original box with new headphones, a charger, and one of the outlet cube chargers. The phone did not have a scratch on it either. On top of all this, it shipped so fast! At first, the phone was not fully unlocked, but I emailed her and she completely unlocked the phone for me. I would HIGHLY recommend this to anyone! I would also buy from this seller again. She was wonderful! (The person who sold it to me was Marsiffer's Book Barn, not this seller)."
"Apple",1,"Tried to activate phone and Sprint told me it was reported lost or stolen. Phone was brand new in the box. Beware when purchasing phones on amazon."
"Apple",5,"this came with very few small scratches. everything works and my daughter loves it! would definitely recommend to someone else."
"Apple",5,"got this for my son for christmas as a replacement for his current phone. The phone is still in great working condition."
"Apple",3,"We received the phone quickly from vendor but had problems with phone and was never able to use the phone. Upon contacting the vendor there was no problem returning the phone. The overall transaction was very professional just the out of pocket expense and wasted time which is at times unavoidable. As for the phone since we did not get a chance to use it, not really sure how to rate the phone."
"Apple",5,"The phone was what I ordered. I had no issues and I would use them again if I have another need."
"Apple",5,"I give to you 5 starts because you deserve it. that experience with you was really great I am very happy to have business with you once again thank you and keep doing like that."
"Apple",1,"Battery is totally shot. Very disappointed. It turns off randomly. Total waste of money. Hopefully Sprint will repair it. SMH."
"Apple",2,"Main button was defective. And the wi-fi broke after 1 month of purchase. As this was a used phone, no warranty could be used. I found out that the wi-fi problem is a common 4S problem, so I do not blame this one to the seller. But without any doubt, the button thing is something that could be pointed out, as this cell was sold as ""like new"". Button works, but not as smooth as it should. I have had previous iPhones and iPads, so this is definitely defective."
"Apple",1,"They say this is a new phone. It is a used phone!!! NOT HAPPY!!! Phone wouldn't except icloud account b/c Kevin somebody's info was still in it. I bought this phone as a gift for my Mom & very disappointed!!! Ended up taking the phone to the Apple store where they told me this happens alot on Amazon ppl saying the phone is ""new"" when it IS NOT :'( However Apple was very nice & took this Amazon phone & then gave my Mom a new iPhone 4s right then & there ;-) Now we are Happy!! I will never buy from Diamond Wireless AGAIN!! If you buy this phone from them I only hope you have better luck than we did with it."
"Apple",3,"Item was not factory unlocked"
"Apple",5,"excelente...100% recomendado"
"Apple",5,"I feel like I bought a new phone. The phone looked new and the seller was prompt with shipping it."
"Apple",4,"Phone was good charger was destroy"
"Apple",5,"my nepwe is happy with this iphone, thank you, very good condition like new."
"Apple",3,"Had to return the phone, it was not usable. They credited me all my money. Thank you."
"Apple",1,"This thing is junk"
"Apple",4,"I am very happy, I received the iphone in good condition."
"Apple",1,"The phone would not active on a sprint acct. must be returned"
"Apple",5,"Received this phone in a timely manner and the customer service rep really answered my query. Didn't use yet with a SIM card but wifi use is very good. Planning to use abroad ."
"Apple",5,"Sometimes the touch screen doesn't respond to my touch, but it's probably nothing major. I really needed an Iphone 4s and quick after my old one broke beyond repair, so I bought this product. It had everything I needed, and it came to me quicker than expected."
"Apple",5,"Awesome product, in condition as described."
"Apple",5,"Great value! Bought used , looks and works like new. Thanks"
"Apple",5,"Excellent experience with this company. I bought an iPhone 4s refurbished via them. It arrived as expected but I soon realized it had a problem with holding a charge and it would not turn off unless it was connected to the charger. After research I determined it had a faulty charging port connector. I contacted JemJem and they worked great with me to provide many options to correct. We settled on a partial refund. Class act company. A+++++"
"Apple",1,"Phone had no MEID number so you CAN'T activate it with Sprint...Completely bogus! Bought two identical phones from JemJem. The other one had a blown earpiece in the phone. Certified refurbished?!? Probably not. Very shady."
"Apple",5,"Love the iPhones"
"Apple",1,"They sold me a product that clearly has a bad or defective battery."
"Apple",1,"Wasn't new thought it was new."
"Apple",5,"Thanks! You did a good job"
"Apple",5,"I've had no issues with this phone. This is my third iPhone. My original one from Apple had a button that stopped working while it was under warranty, so they replaced it with a refurbished one. That didn't last as long unfortunately. So we had to buy out of pocket. So far no complaints with this product."
"Apple",5,"Everything Worked Great with my device. I received the phone right on time. It was in even better condition than advertised!!"
"Apple",1,"Bought a phone supposedly BRAND NEW and 3 months later had to take it to the apple store because internet wouldn't work and find out they cant even work on it because the phone had been tampered with and the front screen wasn't even an apple product!! Now I cant even contact seller because # is disconnected! BE WARNED"
"Apple",1,"The first phone , I was sent was a Verizion phone , I paid and had the phone sent back, I was promise, THAT THE PHONE WAS A MISTAKE, THEN I WAS SENT ANOTHER PHONE AND IT WAS A JAIL BREAK PHONE FROM BOOST MOBILE. I HAD TAKE BOTH PHONES TO SPRINT TO HAVE THEM ACTIVATED THEY WERE NOT , THEY WERE NOT SPRINT PHONES. I NEED A PHONE FOR MY SON, SO I COULD STAY IN CONTACT SINCE I WORK SECOND SHIFT, SO I HAD TO TRADE THE PHONE TO SPRINT TO , SO MY SON WOULD HAVE A PHONE, I WAS SO TIED RUNNING BACK AND FORTH HAVING THEM TO TO TRY TO ACTIVATE PHONES, I LOSE A LOT OF MONEY FOR WHAT I PAID FOR THE PHONE, I HAVE THIS BAD EXPERIENCE AND WILL NEVER BUY ANYTHING OFF LINE ANYMORE.Dixon"
"Apple",5,"Great price for a great phone. If you can't afford a new iPhone, this is what you should get. I like this smaller version and it works great."
"Apple",5,"My wife likes the phone and will upgrade as soon as our provider allows he too. also very happy with the camera."
"Apple",3,"I bought this iphone because the one i had broke but the phone is okay it cam package pretty well but after about a month the speakerphone feature stopped working. Other than that I guess the phone is okay if i keep my head phones on all day and just talk through that."
"Apple",5,"My wife lost her phone and I sure as hell wasn't going to pay the phonr company price or do an upgrade with them. So I found this place. It was highly rated and its on amazon, so I gave it a shot.The phone has been working well, no problems that I can tell.I would do this again with this company with no hesitation."
"Apple",5,"Phone came in and sprint said it couldn't be activated. I called and within 30 minutes got a call back and he has worked with me thru the whole presses to get it activated or replaced. They even set on the phone in 3 way stating to make sure that one way or another they took care of us! I am very pleased with the quick response to my problem and would definitely buy from again!"
"Apple",5,"nice"
"Apple",5,"Works a lot better than my old phone"
"Apple",5,"It was the perfect phone to replace my old 4s..."
"Apple",2,"OK"
"Apple",3,"it ok"
"Apple",4,"I liked,it gets on date was support to!!"
"Apple",5,"Works amazing. Like new. Even looks new."
"Apple",5,"Sugar Shop hooked up a great phone with a great price and even better customer service. SUGAR SHOP ROCKS!"
"Apple",5,"just great"
"Apple",5,"I am really happy and every thing worked out very good"
"Apple",5,"I love this phone. I had an ipod that died and my android phone broke. I bought this as a used phone but it was in new condition. I love the iphone because I can sync it with my ipad and use it in place of my ipod that died. I just hope the battery holds up well."
"Apple",5,"Exceeds expectations, battery last all day, and rarely force closes any apps. It's my first experience with apple software and I haven't had any problems using it."
"Apple",1,"THE PHONE IS ALL CRACKED AND LOCK BUTTON IS STUCK YET THE DESCRIPTION SAID USED:VERY GOOD CONDITION. ENOUGH HAS BEEN SAID."
"Apple",4,"I love it but after two weeks I had to get it replaced because the lock button jammed. I like it so much more than android though"
"Apple",5,"This phone was purchased to update from the Iphone 4, I know there isn't a really big difference between the iphone4 and iphone 4s but to me I can tell a difference. I love the iphone 4s"
"Apple",5,"This iphone was brought for my son..his other iphone was stolen and I didn't want to have to sign up for another two year plan...took it to sprint to activiate...activated with no interuptions...(Just had to wait in the Sprint store forever)...He is very pleased with the iphone...I would recommend buying from this merchant again...The iphone came just as described...it even came faster then expected...which put a smile on my son's face....and when he's happy I'm happy...thanks for the quick service."
"Apple",1,"This is NOT a UNLOCKED phone, there is a debt against the phone or it is STOLEN. It was cracked on the front and back!! from top to bottom!!! I do not like to be lied to. This was my daughters birthday present and we are both upset and will never go to this company again!!!"
"Apple",5,"My phone is perfect. No problems whatsoever. I am completely happy with it. It was much cheaper this way than buying a new phone from the company without an upgrade. Thank you very much."
"Apple",5,"Broke the screen on my old phone and didn't want to pay full price. Phone works great, came quickly. Would definitely buy from them again."
"Apple",4,"No complaints! I was scared to order my iPhone through amazon but I have to say I was very impressed."
"Apple",5,"the phone was on sprint with a sprint sim card, i think it is already unlocked, perfect condition, no problems, just like a regular iphone would work, if your looking for a cheap iphone 4s or in a budget, get this, and if you are looking for a five star or great reviews, get this."
"Apple",1,"The phone only work for 1 day and I return it and still don't get a new phone or my money back and I am very ,very disappointed because I purchase the phone for my son birthday and to find out the is no good! Yes I am upset ."
"Apple",4,"Apple i phone 4 s is okay. I'm not sure whats up with the phone i bought that was used but at times, the volume does not want to work properly and at different times it works just fine. i like it but its just like any other apple i phone, it screen will brake so fast with in just one drop so be sure to have a very expensive protection for it, I would suggest a water proof one."
"Apple",4,"Phone was in better condition than I thought! Wife is very happy with purchase! I will buy one for myself soon!"
"Apple",1,"I bought my 4s I Phone don't knowing that was locked for Sprint use only. And I don't know how to deal with that problem now. And to pay u$s 50 a month (the Sprint Fee), seems too much to use only a Month per year in USA."
"Apple",5,"The phone was in great condition. It had no scratches and it works perfectly. None of the buttons were stuck or broken and the phone was just perfect."
"Apple",4,"My grandson loves the phone. No flaws that I know of. No scratches or cracks. The only setback is that when we purchased the phone, it was in the category of unlocked phones. Only trouble is it was not unlocked so we had to go with a sprint contract which is $92 a month when we were planning on using the phone with straight talk for $45 a month. so we are paying double what we wanted him to have."
"Apple",1,"This is my second burn on trying to get a phone. Once through Craigs List and now Amazon. The phone says black when it is a white one, however, that doesn't bother me as much as the use of the phone. I have it up as loud as it will go and I can barely hear whom I am speaking to. I also can never hear it when I have an incoming call. I have it as loud as it can go and I miss calls all the time. I have tried to take pictures with it and they look blurred and brown; Same with shooting videos.No I am not happy with my purchase, but I am afraid if I return it I will get something worse."
"Apple",5,"the phone is realy in goooood condition like new.I enjoyed it very much.Thank you for the shopping.I am very satisfied with the phone"
"Apple",5,"还不错，中国要用卡贴，支持联通移动2g 买来三天就被偷了Not bad, Chinese use the card affixed to support China Unicom mobile 2g ​​bought was stolen three days oh"
"Apple",5,"Absolutely love this product... I've been wanting one forever and if far exceeds my expectations :)If u are obsessed w apple like me or want a very user friendly phone u need to get this. I got my mom an iPod touch for xMas and she loves it then I showed her that my phone is exactly the same , she was sold and it will b her next phone too!"
"Apple",5,"Thank you for the product . iPhone 4s gorgeous condition , didn't activate it yet so I hope for good ESN :D ok going to jailbreak now TATA"
"Apple",5,"The phone works awesome and I had no problems activating it...shipped on time also. Great buy! Everything the advertisement said was true and I'm really happy with this product."
"Apple",5,"Working well so far and came in great condition as described. As a matter of fact I'm posting from it right now!"
"Apple",5,"I wish this could be a perminant unlocked phone, however with its listed price, this should be good for people who don't want a conrtact."
"Apple",1,"dont buy it from this person, they are stolen. whoever it is will send it to you with no esn on it, so that means it's stolen. plus they are pretty much jipping you about 200 dollars."
"Apple",1,"I purchased the iPhone 4s through Amazon to try and save money. I have tried to activate the phone through Sprint only to find that it is stolen. I am returning the phone today and if my money is not returned I will take legal action. Save the hassle and just don't buy from this company. Keep in mind this review is solely rated to the seller, NOT the iPhone 4s"
"Apple",1,"No lo recomiendo.. muy mal el aspecto del tlf.. y termine pagando mucho mas dinero por desbloquearlo!!"
"Apple",1,"Was in great shape but was not a sprint iPhone"
"Apple",5,"just like advertised"
"Apple",4,"Good"
"Apple",1,"Works only sometimes. Cuts out. Can't get on internet. Doesn't hold a charge. Thanks alot. Def not ""like new""."
"Apple",5,"I do not know why I need write a review again,anyway this is a very good cable,I can use at least half year and no need change anymore!"
"Apple",4,"Good condition and other than a broken connector for charging."
"Apple",5,"Amazing condition when it was received, works very well. When I left my last company, I had to leave their iPhone 5S behind as well...so I found a this older 4s on Amazon and it has surpassed my expectations! Nice job! A vendor you can trust."
"Apple",5,"Super good"
"Apple",5,"Purchased it for my daughter no complaints yet . I was kinda afraid to by a used phone but it worked out for me and my daughter"
"Apple",5,"Worked just fine."
"Apple",5,"Perfect."
"Apple",2,"Did not match numbers with my carrier nice phone though."
"Apple",1,"I purchased a iPhone 4S and it had hardware failures within two months. They replaced it and I had similar issues a month later. They will not doing anything else for me. I like Apple products just not this seller."
"Apple",1,"Based on a prior wonderful experience with an iphone 4S, I purchased a new iphone 4S for $215.00 to give as a Christmas present for my daughter in late 2014. The phone worked for about 4-5 months and then suddenly stopped working. I have been advised that there is a problem with the mother board that will cost an additional $150.00 to repair. I would not puruchase this product again."
"Apple",5,"very good deal"
"Apple",5,"worked well. Used on Freedom Pop network"
"Apple",5,"Honest seller, packaged well, I still have it, great phone..it sure would work better if I didn't smash the screen myself.. Time for a new one. I like buying used Iphones. I don't have to treat it as if it's a newborn child. They last.Don't need to say much about the phone. Even in used condition, Apple is now my brand of choice."
"Apple",1,"This is not a sprint phone it is aTT phone ! Can not be used. This was a complete waste of money for me. Its useless to me. I purchased this phone as a backup phone in case mine or my husband broke. There's no way to unlock it and use it with sprint. I would not recommend anyone to purchase a phone this way."
"Apple",1,"Commercial fraud that it does not work with the local my networks"
"Apple",1,"I purchased a phone about 6 weeks ago and had nothing but issues. It was setup for sprint service but couldn't be added to the network. The phone was listed as 'lost or stolen'. I have since returned it and hope no one has to go through a similar experience."
"Apple",5,"Phone was as described. Really fast shipping."
"Apple",4,"perfect"
"Apple",5,"Great company,great phone!"
"Apple",1,"It was supposed to be locked to Sprint, but it was locked to AT&T. I had to send it back.:("
"Apple",4,"Glass covers entire face of phone. Makes it hard to find a case, works great with otter box"
"Apple",5,"I really love this iPhone it looks brand new its was well packedand i have no problem with it so far. I will be buying another one from this seller in the future i recommend this to anyone"
"Apple",4,"The popper replaces one we've had for many years. It was just what we needed.The iPhone is good, no problems. I'm still getting used to it because I haven't had a smart phone before."
"Apple",5,"Works Excellent, No problem getting connected to Sprint."
"Apple",5,"Phone works great!! Came in two days! Very Satisfied!!! Would do business again anytime!!! Thanks"
"Apple",5,"Easy to transfer. Great phone for the money!"
"Apple",5,"perfect"
"Apple",5,"Bought this for my dad and its awesome. A year later its still running strong. Great phone."
"Apple",5,"Excellent!"
"Apple",1,"it was not fully functional. I wish if I can return it and get my money back."
"Apple",4,"my son has no issues with the phone, as of yet"
"Apple",1,"Did not work, I sent it back and never got a refund"
"Apple",5,"Awesome...works great as an iPod"
"Apple",1,"I'm not satisfied, the iPhone was supposed to be in good condition but it dies all the time, regardless of what battery percentage it is at. I have to carry around a portable charger because I never know when it will die."
"Apple",5,"The kids love their iPhone."
"Apple",1,"Took phone to Sprint store and as soon as the clerk opened the back, he saw the serial number (or whatever number identifier they look at) and right away new it was not a Sprint phone. Also there was something wrong with the SIM card, or it didn't come with a SIM card. Anyway, I had to return the phone and got a refund. So buyer beware . . ."
"Apple",5,"exellet"
"Apple",5,"Phone arrived on time and as described, very satisfied."
"Apple",5,"Ordered this phone when my son broke his other one. Very pleased with the condition of the phone."
"Apple",5,"I've had to replace my cell phone twice in the last month. Don't ask. Suffice it to say it involved a toilet and a bad fall. This phone arrived in perfect condition and I was able to transfer my number, data, etc. via Sprint online. Thank you!"
"Apple",5,"Still boxed in it's factory wrapping! (y)"
"Apple",1,"Could not use the phone. Went to Sprint to turn it on and there was an unpaid bill attatched"

"Apple",2,"it is not a like new iphone, has scratch on the iphone, but ok to use, just got what you pay"
"Apple",1,"Speaker went out within the month, was acting up from the day we received it but thought it was some error we had made in the settings (never having an apple product before) scared the hell out of us because when it was plugged in to charge the speaker made a electrical shock type noise that(due to the recent story's of electrocution we avoided it like the plague) but soon realized it was the death throws of the speaker so he was able to use it with headphones and begged me not to send it for return or repair......Two months later and it died, intermittently resurrecting when it choice to. sooooo we thought it was the charger so have bought 5 different ones Until finally it gave up and completely s*** out on him.....By then it was to late to get any type of help from the seller who just made rude comments about why i waited so long and what i wanted them to do about it months later when i was just being polite and bringing the issues to their attention....."
"Apple",5,"Phone is working great!"
"Apple",1,"takes a full charge but dies at 50%. not very happy"
"Apple",5,"Nice replacement phone for my son."
"Apple",4,"I brought this for my girlfriend and she loves the phone. I don't like Apple I prefer Samsung but she like this product!"
"Apple",1,"Many problems with this phone. I connected to my account and it showed up as a white iPhone but it is black. Then it would not connect to Sprint which it says it is locked to Sprint, but the only networks available were ATT and TMobile. Since this was my second time attempting to buy an iPhone from Amazon for my daughter's birthday (4/1) and it still didn't work, I said forget it. So now my daughter uses two phones, one for calling and one for FaceTime but only on wifi."
"Apple",1,"was not locked to Sprint as stated"
"Apple",3,"It was as described but did not have 16gb when recieved"
"Apple",1,"Good morning the phone iphone 4s low order 116-6256512-7837051 informron me was new and wine used too is recaienta the battery lasts 20 minutes if you do not really feel cheated by this acquisition as it is not expected and can not I enjoy it I want to solve this problem because as I said I feel cheated, give me back the money by gift card to buy another phone if it gets to that price."

"Apple",5,"Thanks"
"Apple",5,"Has been working awesome! Great phone, and wonderful customer service!"
"Apple",5,"Perfect phone... Hooked this up to my Ring+ account, no issues whatsoever. Now I have a cheap phone with a free monthly plan that works for me! Couldn't be happier. If you need a cheap plan, take a look at Ring+ and see what you think, uses the Sprint network for service."
"Apple",5,"Held all expectation"
"Apple",1,"Scratches all over the screen and it looked filthy."
"Apple",4,"One of those iPhones that still manages to stay relevant regardless of it's age."
"Apple",1,"I bought this as a gift for my great nephew who lives in Australia, I did not read the detail about the phone being locked to sprint. I cannot unlock it from Australia. One very disappointed little boy."
"Apple",5,"The phone looked new and worked perfect on my sprint network."
"Apple",4,"Was satisfied, except that the mic was dysfunctional. The phone worked on speaker but not on regular mode."
"Apple",4,"It was fantastic and I love my new phone!!"
"Apple",4,"Came on time and is in working condition i love it"
"Apple",3,"Volume turns itself up, screen glitches, however I was warned of some cracks"
"Apple",1,"It was wrong one"
"Apple",4,"The phone was as described, and the delivery was accurate. My grandson says the phone was like new, and we didn't not have any problems with the activation at Sprint."
"Apple",5,"perfect! product as described, immediate shipping!"
"Apple",1,"The phone was in good condition. But it was not unlocked as advertised. I bought phone since it was unlocked and I could not use it."
"Apple",1,"I try to activate the iphone 4s in front of the Verizon wireless, but the service told me that the iphone 4s I just bought from Werehouse Deal is a stolen one!!!!"
"Apple",5,"My phone was exactly as described, in great condition. It was wrapped securely in bubble wrap and came with everything it was supposed to. And it got to me very quickly. I love my phone and am glad I found one here in such perfect condition and for a great price"
"Apple",5,"I broke my other 4s trying to change the screen so I had to pay up, now I have it replaced and done so by a great seller."
"Apple",3,"Buena tarde Srs: Por favor necesito ayuda por que compre el teléfono paraVenezuela y esta bloqueado ayúdeme mil gracias"
"Apple",5,"I bought this phone for my wife, and she loves it. The Siri voice command feature is great. I have had one for 6 months and we both would highly recommend the iPhone 4S."
"Apple",5,"It came in three days, exactly as described and functioning great! I haven't parted with it in days. I recommend!"
"Apple",2,"I have buy 4 4s, two of them are in white and others black, all marked used-good, the white is ok but the black really have poor quality, the steel outside if full of scratch and the edge of black glass is broken, i don't think it can make used-good. much more difference like the same grade white I received."
"Apple",3,"the two white 4s marked used-good, is accept, little scratch on the front and back side, visible knock on the corner"
"Apple",5,"What a breathe of fresh air. You delivered exactly what you advertised. I would recommend you to my friends and family."
"Apple",5,"Works great! My daughter was thrilled"
"Apple",1,"First of all a cordial greeting I write to notify my troublesome one and dissatisfaction since the telephone that and bought to one of his sellers an iPhone 4s white color of 16g after my patient wait to come defective and without other one is able to acquire already the Venezuelan alone government grants 300 annual dollars not as doing or that it does in this case please it helps"
"Apple",5,"exelente muy bueno el telefono"
"Apple",5,"Very happy with phone. I was able to activate it on Tracfone (Verizon)"
"Apple",1,"This is NOT a Verizon phone. Totally misrepresented. Don't bother buying it if you need a Verizon phone."
"Apple",5,"Phone in perfect condition"
"Apple",5,"The phone is in excellent condition. It came in the original box with all the accessories. I was able to activate it with Verizon."
"Apple",5,"This is an excellent buy. Everything works great and it is in top shape. Fast delivery too. Thanks"
"Apple",5,"Pleased"
"Apple",3,"Im Need more informatioñ this item I need apple Id and password from passed owner"
"Apple",5,"Great deal"
"Apple",5,"Item as described, great seller"
"Apple",4,"Nice perfect"
"Apple",2,"The only reason I'm even giving this item 2 stars is because the phone has lasted me 6 months. But what I bought was supposed to be a new phone, not refurbished. I dropped it recently and had to get it fixed, and the repair shop said they found VOID stickers inside. The button was also not complete and had been rigged to work. When I got the phone the button wasn't squared off, so I was suspicious, but never thought too much of it. It's a decent phone though, but if I had known better I would not have paid extra for ""New"". It's false advertising, and it's not right."
"Apple",4,"Great"
"Apple",4,"Love the phone; not, the battery life so much! Battery life is something apple needs to dramatically improve in all of it's phones. It is super cool you can text other iphones for free! I also activated it with tracfone and it was a breeze!"
"Apple",1,"The iphone5 was supposed to be neww. Well it define try wasn't. The phone can't hold a charge. Had trouble connecting with the Internet. Paid a lot of for a worthless phone."
"Apple",2,"Did not receive the charger that was suppose to come with phone."
"Apple",5,"EXCELENT"
"Apple",3,"didn't work well. too much trouble to return"
"Apple",1,"The device was NOT as described. It appeared on the outside to be flawless, but after spending 1 hour on the phone with my carrier Verizon, and over 1 hour at the Apple store, it was unusable. I had to return it. The cell phone I had didn't work at all so I had to go the whole time with no phone, and continue with no phone for an extra week and a half as I had already spent my money on this phone and had to wait for the return to be able to afford to try ordering a phone somewhere else. I wish the seller had been more interested in trying to find a resolution instead of just accepting the returned device."
"Apple",5,"Everything was perfect. Quick delivery as well."
"Apple",2,"Stopped working soon after purchase. My grandson is so disappointed and I cannot afford to buy again"
"Apple",5,"Ok good"
"Apple",5,"Exactly as promised. Pristine/Brand New condition in factory sealed box.Verizon IMEI."
"Apple",3,"Good"
"Apple",5,"Great phone."
"Apple",5,"Excellent condition. Was very pleased."
"Apple",3,"All is good"
"Apple",5,"Great phone, was used and came in like new condition"
"Apple",4,"ok"
"Apple",5,"excellent"
"Apple",5,"really good no scratches on front or back i love and it came a day early just love it"
"Apple",1,"It over heated every 5 minutes, and all I would do is text."
"Apple",5,"Very pleasedExactly as described and shipped immediately"
"Apple",5,"I PHONE 4S NEW as described.... Verizon. Everything worked fine . Called Verizon hooked us up and my daughter I don't think has stopped using it since. She is very happy with her Iphone 4s and unlike the new series I phone6 its not a big phone to carry around and it was very affordable I dont care if it a year behind the newest latest my daughter is as happy as one can be too."
"Apple",5,"Excellent an worked smoothly!"
"Apple",1,"It's a China Telecom Version!!! IMEI on the sim slot is erased physically!!! SO disappointed."
"Apple",4,"Phone works great, looks good"
"Apple",5,"I adore this phone. I bought it to use with Tracfone's Bring Your Own Phone program and it has been a dream. I activated the phone through the Tracfone website and within two hours everything was transferred and working perfectly. I had been using a Samsung Galaxy Centura, so even though this is not the newest generation of phones, it feels magnificent (I updated to OS 8 and it works even better!). I had tried out FreedomPop's free phone service for about a month prior to buying this, and was using a Samsung Galaxy S3 but the service was so abysmal and unreliable that I had to return it. I'm so glad I decided to try this. I couldn't be happier."
"Apple",5,"Phone works great!"
"Apple",5,"Good phone"
"Apple",5,"GREAT!!!!!!!!"
"Apple",1,"This phone was not originally Verizon aand for the money that was paid I can't get on the internet unless I am somewhere where someone has WiFi. Very disappointing ."
"Apple",3,"the phone came with one screw missing and the other loose on the plugin for charging. the battery goes dead overnight if not plugged into a charger."
"Apple",1,"At first glance, the phone looked fine, however the photo's I took using my phone looks ""foggy"". Upon closer inspection, there are gouges/crapes right on the exterior of the camera lens. Also, while this is a 3G phone, it has difficulty connecting. My partner has the exact same phone and when in the house or riding down the highway, his will be on 3G while mine is on 1x... whatever that is. Doing simple processes is delayed as if the processor or RAM is having some problem"
"Apple",2,"You can't hear from ear piece and the call screen disappears and every once in a while letters and numbers flicker while in a call phone had issues when shipped"
"Apple",2,"Worked fine for 2 weeks and then the speaker went out"
"Apple",1,"Save your money, they claimed the phone was but it's not. I've had the phone 2 months and now have to pay $120 for a new battery and new screen."
"Apple",1,"Product was defective, not charging properly. Battery drains immediately even while on standby. Something that shouldn't have been sold to us. People just like to sell you anything even if they are aware of it being defective."
"Apple",5,"Phone works great and just as promised on the discription, the only problem was I paid extra for 2 day shipping and it actually took a week but other then the wait everything came as expected"
"Apple",1,"the owner did not think it was relevant to make it clear that the iphone he/she was selling was, in fact broken and the screen would not even turn on. I even took the phone to best buy and had them examine it and was told that it was beyond repair. Therefore, I paid $250.00 for an irriparable iphone. I contacted the seller to see if I could get my money back and was told that he/she did not provide refunds but offered to sell me a screen for the broken iphone that I purchased, (this would not have fixed the iphone and the owner was just trying to scam me further.) I am obviously not happy with my purchase and would advise anyone else against purchasing from this seller; he/she is a scam artist and fooled me."
"Apple",5,"Great experience from beginning to end. Someone stole my first I-phone and I ordered from another company at first and did not get what I wanted. I was a little hesitant at first, but, it turned out to be the best decision. Great customer service,affordable price, I was able to use my AMEX points as well, timely delivery and new out of the box condition phone! What a peace of mind!"
"Apple",5,"I bought this phone for my daughter's 15th birthday. She loves it! It arrived in pristine condition, we easily activated it at our local Verizon store, and it has been working perfectly ever since. The seller provided great follow up to our order. I would absolutely purchase from this seller again. :)"
"Apple",1,"This is a defective phone advertised under the precept of it being used - VERY good condition. Advertised as slight water damage causing screen to have minor discoloration on top and bottom, no crack screen ..which we discovered meant in reality that it was severely water damaged, the camera didn't work (very good condition ..not), it had a replacement screen that was not properly connected to give complete visibility (no crack screen ..of course not it was replaced), the screen continuously jumped up and down and evenly went black (which i'm not sure if that is better or worse than the minor discoloration on top and bottom of screen) all within 3 hours of activating the phone. This phone was in anything but good condition, and dishonest semantics justified dishonest behavior and that is bad business dealing for such (what I thought was) a trustworthy site as Amazon."
"Apple",5,"Phone came in a box with accessories and works great!!!! I was pleasantly surprised. Was just like new. Would recommend"
"Apple",5,"The truth is, they are both fabulous pieces of equipment that we are all very lucky to have in our lives. I actually remember having a 4 digit phone number and 5 people sharing the same line!! But, for reasons subtle which I am not even totally conscious of, I love my iPhone and I didn't love my Android."
"Apple",1,"I recently bought an iPhone 4S from this seller. When it arrived it looked fine. We went to Verizon to set it up- and here is where the problem started. The camera light would not turn off, the tech said that's a sign of water damage and it was literally draining the battery at very rapid rate. I booked a Genius Bar appointment at apple to see if it could be fixed. When they opened up the phone they discovered it has been tampered with, voiding the warranty and the light was not repairable.Contacted the seller who sent us another iPhone 4S. POTENTIAL BUYERS READ THIS: given our issue with the last phone we booked another apple store appointment just to have the phone checked out. It's even worse this time around, the apple tech said it had been tampered with and cautioned us to get rid of the phone as soon as possible. When I pushed him for details on what was wrong with the phone, He said the phone had been tampered with to the point that it can be used for IDENTITY THEFT, basically opening any accounts used on the phone and getting account information- he wasn't supposed to tell us this but thank god he did! Almost everyone I know has a banking app or email with very private information.No matter how much it ends up costing you, do not buy from this seller. I'm fairly certain all of the positive reviews are from people who are none the wiser and never had their phones inspected by an apple tech. Remember that it takes over a year to get your identity back if its stolen, not worth it for a used iPhone."
"Apple",2,"the product was not required because I'm blocked with the telephony company verizon, I try to unlock it but it is very expensive and keep him. now the battery does not work and not to do, I lost my money, please tell me that I can do, if I can still return it. thanks"
"Apple",5,"this phone was great my son was the one to purchase this phone , I would recommend to friends and family!"
"Apple",5,"Great , clean and perfect. Loving this iPhone 4s"
"Apple",1,"Came with a bad battery."
"Apple",5,"GREAT DEVICE!"
"Apple",1,"Its not 4s they gave me 4 instead!!!!! Made me so disappointed"
"Apple",5,"I bought this to use on my Tracfone account. Works perfectly, and I save a lot of bucks. This iPhone looks like new, includes charger and cable, plain box. Very pleased with the purchase."
"Apple",1,"I return phone couldn't be activated."
"Apple",5,"This phone works as expected. It does have front and rear cameras and the video and photo quality is very good. Getting it activated with Straight Talk was a chore, but it can be done. You don't need the expensive activation kit to activate it. Just go to the Straight talk web site and get an activation number. Most likely you will still have to call Straight Talk to activate the phone."
"Apple",1,"I ordered this ""new"" iphone on August 2nd and the battery was bad from the start. So I called the apple company for my 1 year warranty you receive from any new apple product. But as I was talking to the people from apple they informed me that my phone had been used 3 years prior to me even receiving my phone, so I was unable for the warranty. This phone is NOT new and now only 2 months later my phone is unable to even turn on due to the previous use. I recommend ordering it right from a phone provider, such as verizon, sprint, at&t, etc. due to the scams like this seller has going on."
"Apple",5,"It's all goood"
"Apple",3,"I recieved my order in a timely manner. Although I received the wrong GB..I decided to keep it. overall I'm pleased"
"Apple",5,"I was worries after the reviews but it came brand new. Perfect"
"Apple",5,"After grandson's 5C phone got left in his baseball pants and went through the wash, we got him the 4S phone. The phone arrived in 2 days and he is very happy with it."
"Apple",5,"The phone is great. My order was on time. Amazon is my new way of buying things. Very happy customer!"
"Apple",3,"Good appearance, no obvious signs of use, call clear!"
"Apple",3,"Battery can only use 5 hours"
"Apple",5,"I spent a long time researching phones online because a lot of these deals seemed like scams. This one was not and I'm glad I made the right choice. Phone was brand new and had zero problems. I used it as a temporary for a month and it worked perfectly!"
"Apple",5,"great product... everything the seller said it was. my wife has been thrilled."
"Apple",1,"i did not realize the phone was a Verizon phone have to return I have att carrier"
"Apple",5,"My son absolutely loves his phone. May buy another for my mom next!! Great/fast shipping awesome seller. Will buy again. Thanks"
"Apple",5,"This item was shipped timely and was new out of the box as advertised. The phone works great!"
"Apple",5,"Just put the screen in today myself. Seems to be working the way it's supposed to. It was really easy to install just watch a YouTube video and follow the steps to a T... Would recommend and buy again at this point."
"Apple",5,"Just as decribed. Thanks you!"
"Apple",5,"Exactly as described."
"Apple",3,"its ok The battery life is kinna low ."
"Apple",1,"Received a sprint item instead of Verizon. No one returned my emails. Had to file a complaint..."
"Apple",1,"Phone not as advertised.....LOCKED"
"Apple",1,"The phone has no sound except through the headphone jack. We tried everything to get it to work. I am one for honesty and am VERY upset that they tried to lie about a hardware problem. (Yes that is what the problem is)"
"Apple",1,"The phone worked fine for a few weeks, then started glitching. I asked to send it back and get a refund the seller pretty much said no that it was the software for Apple."
"Apple",1,"fuckyou！SB cnm Mobile 100% refurbished assembly machine. The seller may be a chinese. Mobile phones may come from Shenzhen, china. Packaging, manual, charger, data cable, earphone. All false. Check the warranty period. The back cover of the phone actually chinese. Battery fever, power down fast. We don't buy it. He's got a complaint."
"Apple",5,"I love itThanksGeorge"
"Apple",5,"excelled"
"Apple",1,"The Apple Iphone4s is shutting off continuously I'm not happy with this phone the battery percentage seems to be off"
"Apple",5,"Very good condition..also had ear piece charger which was a plus. Very pleased"
"Apple",5,"very good"
"Apple",4,"Everything works, but the battery is basically shot. Would have liked to know this in the description."
"Apple",5,"Everything went great"
"Apple",5,"Was in excellent condition and worked as advertised."
"Apple",1,"The first phone I received was a turned in gov't. phone with a bad battery, the second phone was an a.t.t. phone. I sent them both back and went back to my ravine flip phone that always works. So much for upgrades!"
"Apple",1,"The phone required a $75 repair less than a week after I received it."
"Apple",5,"love it..."
"Apple",5,"I am extremely happy with this iPhone, and was surprised by the incredibly fast shipping."
"Apple",1,"Does not link to my Wi-Fi. VERY slow to respond to ANY commands, Cant wait 'til my contract allows me to get a new phone!"
"Apple",4,"good"
"Apple",5,"this is my first iphone. was using a android phone. i love the iphone!"
"Apple",5,"no issues and works great"
"Apple",5,"Love this phone."
"Apple",1,"This is the one purchase I've made without reading the customer reviews, and boy was that a mistake.This phone is clearly marked ""Verizon"", but when I turn it on to activate it, the phone informs me that I need a SIM card.Now, correct me if I'm wrong, but I've never ever used a SIM card since I've been with Verizon Wireless - 6 years now.Now I have to worry about the fact that I may have a stolen phone in my possession that doesn't even work and cost me $130. Buying a product from this seller was a huge mistake."
"Apple",4,"fast shipping great price"
"Apple",3,"Battery dies ASAP, have to purchase new battery, iPhones aren't like other cell phones do you have to pay someone to install battery or purchase special tools and hope you do it right."
"Apple",5,"Product was delivered quickly and was as described. Phone is in working order and i am pleased with the fast delivery."
"Apple",5,"Came in time. Has performed well."
"Apple",5,"very good"
"Apple",1,"The iphone doesn't have hole for chip. It doesn't work."
"Apple",5,"It is a great value. It works just fine. I love Apple."
"Apple",5,"Seller was helpful fast delivery great phone. Have had it almost year still works great . Was just like described 2 small scratches on glass I barely saw"
"Apple",5,"I love this phone when I recieved it all I had to do was charge it up thanks to A to Z company and Amazon I'm in the 21 century"
"Apple",1,"This phone was sold to me by Amazon Warehouse Deals, Inc. Nowhere in the description did it state that this was a LOCKED phone! I am beyond disgusted with Amazon right now!"
"Apple",5,"This is exactly what I expected. I recommend purchasing from XOMADIC . There are little to no scratches/scufs no cracks at all. When I first got I thought I had a new Phone. Also it came 5 days early which is also a plus. I highly recommend purchasing from him. Very satisfied."
"Apple",1,"The description clearly stated that it was a Verizon phone, but when I called to activate the phone, Verizon assured me otherwise. I essentially bought a $210 paper weight."
"Apple",5,"I bought this to replace my husbands iPhone 4S. It works just fine. Very pleased!"
"Apple",3,"I buy it unlock the phone to find it, but when it is not received Unlocked, I need to pay an additional $ 56 to unlock it.Although it looks very good."
"Apple",5,"Thanks so much for a smooth purchase and A+ service. Will be giving this phone to my sister for christmas and am very stoked to have gotten such a great product at such a reasonable price. Cheers!"
"Apple",5,"It is great, Brand new phone as I expected. Arrive in time. The transaction was flawless! The seller even contact me during the shipment. Now it is on my hand, I will say it is a quite literally very good product and customer-service I could ever hope for. Will deal business with the seller next time. Hope you have good business! """
"Apple",5,"Good afternoon, I received, thank you very much for the product. arrived in excellent condition"
"Apple",4,"Very pleased with this product. However it was missing the earphones that were suppose to be included as stated in the ordering information."
"Apple",1,"this phone that i ordered from this CadamL was a piece of crap, the speaker was busted on it and it didnt work properly, after trying to fix it, not aware that there was a month i had to get it back to this sorry ass vendor, i wrote him when i finally gave up on it and it was to late to do anything with and he told me and i quote, ""The speaker works perfect and you had the phone for a month! The phone was in perfect condition when I sent it. The phone had insurance from UPS take it up ith them! No refunds you had for over a month with insurance from UPS! It's no telling what conditions the phone is in now!!"" ............ now tell me this, how do you figgure that you get insurance from ups????? ok A$$4013"
"Apple",3,"Is a phone brand new if there's no plastic around the box? Original screen protector sheets around the phone? A hair in the the box? After I cleaned the fingerprints the phone only worked after I removed and reinserted the SIM card. I love iPhones and couldn't stand being without it so I did not contact the seller. But beware of who your buying from when not directly buying from amazon."
"Apple",5,"Very happy with the iphone. Other than a small chip on the corner of the phone it works PERFECTLY!It arrived in great timing (4 days) and was able to activate the phone with no problems. I am very pleased with this product and would recommend buying from this user again."
"Apple",5,"I don't like the prices. I am not impressed with their customer service. The thing is their products perform brilliantly. I have IPad, IPhone, Mac Pro, and Itouch in the house. They are easy to use and trouble free. I just wish they weren't so greedy and they manufactured devices in the states. Their history of exploiting workers in China is terrible especially considering the profit margin they maintain."
"Apple",5,"I am very busy and use my phone a lot for business. I am always hesitant to get a new phone because I hate to ""figure it out"".This Iphone 4s has been the easiest phone that I have EVER owned and it's FUN!"
"Apple",5,"I had an issue with Verizon getting the phone activated. These guys were incredibly responsive and helpful getting something resolved that in the end actually had nothing to do with the phone they sold me.As for the phone itself. It came in great condition.Rob"
"Apple",4,"Phone is in excellent shape physically. Screen has some lighting/image burn issues and battery life is not like new...but then again the phone isn't new so that's to be expected I suppose."
"Apple",3,"Wifi didn't work on this phone. It wasn't from a lack of trying. I liked other features of this phone and that's why I gave it a 3."
"Apple",1,"I will never shop at amazon again to this date I still cannot use the phone I purchased because there was no user name and pass word to unlocked the device and to make things worst the website that was provided to unlocked the phone was not able to do so"
"Apple",5,"Nice phone for a good price. If you need a new phone, and it's not time for an upgrade under your contract, this is the way to go."
"Apple",4,"As expected I rode in a white horse drawn chariot, along side me was Elppa. The road littered with decomposing"
"Apple",4,"it is good. no problems so far, it isnt slow and i got it set up nice and easily. good stuff"
"Apple",4,"I found this phone to be a good purchase. It arrived on time and as it was described. I have yet to find any fault with it."
"Apple",5,"I was very unsure about purchasing this phone at first, especially due to some of the reviews... But them being old reviews, I just took the risk and purchased it anyways! I received it today and so far everything seems to be working just fine. Already comes with ios7 installed and original charger and cable come with it as well. Phone is used, it has normal wear on the silver edges, but nothing to the point of complaining. I also got it activated without a problem :)"
"Apple",5,"I have enough to buy a 4S product performance is perfect, the Internet phone messages are very good. Very grateful to the U.S. Amazon warehouse to give me such a perfect product."
"Apple",1,"The phone is received was more than excessively scratched up, it took Verizon 2 hours to activate it, and it's overheating as we speak in my hand. I've literally had it activated for all of 5 hours fully charged it and it's battery is already dead. The description is nothing like what I received this morning. I'm beyond pissed."
"Apple",1,"These phone keeps on turning it self off and the battery life last on like 3 hours or less. So if there is any one who knows what up let me know it a it's a hassle to return it."
"Apple",5,"Outstanding used phone. Received very fast. No problems setting it up. Looks new!"
"Apple",2,"We've had some problems with it.."
"Apple",5,"Very nice phone. Works great. Only wish I had spent the money and got the new model with a larger screen"
"Apple",5,"Bought this for my son @ college. Haven't heard any complaints…that's a very good sign."
"Apple",1,"NOT A NEW PHONE FROM MANUFACTURERPhone had finger prints on it upon opening. Phone info was taped to phone not on box as new apple phone. Used bluetooth to setup my phone and add all personal info and passwords phone, internet, and apps. Shut the bluetooth of to set phone sounds and learned the speakers do not work. I plugged the phone in to charge when I checked it, it was dead and found it wont charge."
"Apple",2,"The phone is being returned because the battery would not charge properly. The phone appeared new and I never had the Apple store check it out, so it may or may not be a refurb, returned or used one. Remember that these 4S phones were all built at the same time. So that means that even if you get a new phone, it will have an ancient battery. The phone would take an inordinately long time to charge and would never get up to 100%. After three weeks it got so bad that I was trying to charge it almost all day long. and had to put it into airplane mode so that it could even get up to 40% charge.I would recommend that anyone buying an older phone be very careful to see that the phone charges normally right out of the gate. If it does not, send it back."
"Apple",4,"Received phone it was in great condition."
"Apple",5,"Awesome condition, very clean. No problems at all"
"Apple",5,"The 4S is a great phone, I never realized how great until it was trade in time and I got a 'Droid phone. Sure my iPhone is only 3G, but I don't use the hotspot feature that much to really care, as an internet client browser it is excellent. In terms of functionality, well all of it's apps work, I can't say the same thing for my Android phone,Sure I have a Mac Mini at home and everything integrates well, which is how it should all work. I actually do some Mac programming and I'm a long time Unix lover so the mac is perfect for me, my phone, which runs the latest and greatest OS does so and will continue to because Apple doesn't fragment their iOS distro unlike other companies. There is basically one platform which makes life simple for developers...enough of this stuffThe bottom line is that it works, from Siri to browsing, texting and integrating with my desktop. When it finally dies, I'll get a new iPhone, Foxcomm might suck as a company, but they make some great products,."
"Apple",5,"Looked brand new even though it's used! Works great! I love the design and the iPhone is the best phone"
"Apple",4,"I needed a replacement phone as I ruined my iPhone 5 last October. The phone arrived in a timely fashion, great appearance, but better yet it has been working flawlessly. Plan to get one for my husband."
"Apple",5,"I was skeptical about buying a phone online. But I did a lot of research and was careful to pick a reputable seller. I also checked that the IMEI had been cleared and that the phone was set up for my carrier. I received the phone promptly and had no problem setting up the service. The phone is just like brand new, but I paid about half the price...love it!"
"Apple",5,"Highly recommended from here! Came good as new and no problems. Works perfectly fine and I couldn't enjoy it anymore than I do."
"Apple",5,"They did such an incredible time. The phone got here before it was scheduled and is in tip top shape. Runs perfect and they are very efficient.Highly recommended!"
"Apple",4,"Going from an android to and iPhone there's much of a difference. I like the iPhone more, the only reason I am not giving it 5 stars is because the screen cracks quickly. I've had the phone for 2 months and my screen is already cracked."
"Apple",1,"We'll the company that shipped the phone either messed up with fedex or FedEx messed up either way I didn't get the phone when I was supposed to but that isn't what bothered me per se, what bothered me is when I was activating the supposed new phone I found out through verizon that the phone had two previous owners...I contacted the company that is the go between with amazon and they blew me off. In the end they just beat me through attrition."
"Apple",1,"You bought a phone that was supposed to be new and was refurbished, you send it me on a napkin whitout charger or accesories and when i return it rather than returning me 300 dollars that i pay for it, you only give me 200 dollar, abusive. Get unable to retur 80 percent at least."
"Apple",1,"I got the phone from a reputable seller. The phone was shipped within a couple hours of purchase. It arrived to my office within 72 hours. The phone looked like 8/10 with the described surface damage. It looked great. However, on the first attempt at an incoming call, it is sent directly to voicemail and it never rings on my end. Only when the outside caller attempts to redial does the phone ring. So the result was a ton of missed calls for my business, which I cannot afford."
"Apple",1,"Wasn't unlock had to ship it to the states to get apple to unlock it"
"Apple",5,"Works great!"
"Apple",2,"It wasn't a 4S, it was a plain 4."
"Apple",5,"Phone arrived promptly, exactly as described. Looks and works like new, no problems getting it set up on my account."
"Apple",5,"Very good phone"
"Apple",5,"My iPhone purchase was easy to search & find what I was looking for. The process was secure and best of all, my phone was exactly what was stated in the description. It also arrived four days before the suggested arrival date. Awesome!"
"Apple",5,"The phone arrived on time and was in perfect condition. Works great! Love it!"
"Apple",1,"very slow"
"Apple",4,"I was very pleased at first with the iPhone 4s! After about two weeks the screen quit working but then a few days later it started working again. Now, so far so good. Working great! It may have been something I did, who knows? Thanks"
"Apple",1,"Horrible condition. Home button would not work. EStock is scam"
"Apple",4,"The iphone came in on time and was in good working condition , still going good after 2 months. I will upgrade to 5 stars after 1 year.Jay"
"Apple",1,"This iPhone could not be used in the U.S. and was only formatted for use in Asia. DO NOT PURCHASE IT WAS A TOTAL SCAM."
"Apple",1,"He recibido el iphone bloqueado, además la caja indica 16gb y la etiqueta del iphone indica 32gb. La pantalla se aprecia q es usada. En resumen teléfono bloqueado y usado.I received the iphone locked, but also the box indicates 16gb and the label or dtiker on iphone indicates 32gb. Besides the screen ir display have mark as is used. In summary the phone os locked, altered and used."
"Apple",4,"Does everything that I want. I'm sure there are more sophisticated phones on the market but this phone is beyond my capacity to use all its functions. Well worth the price."
"Apple",5,"The bike was purchased as ""used - like new"" and it indeed arrived ""used - like new"". Great condition with headphones and everything."
"Apple",5,"Finally switched to a smart phone and I am VERY happy with this Iphone. Still learning how to use it, but so far all is great"
"Apple",5,"Bought for my wife. I found the camera on the 4s is even better than my Samsung S4 which is 13M."
"Apple",2,"Unfortunately it doesn't stay charged. It also shuts itself off whenever it feels like it. We are disappointed with that."
"Apple",3,"I chose this phone because so many friends and family had and love them. Takes great picture, actually has voice that talks to you for help, does smart phone functions, looks great, easy navigation, nice looking. cons: returned to seller - does not accept all CDMA carriers, only verison for this phone. Antiquated technology, cannot add memory, cannot replace battery, very small screen. Went to Samsung Galaxy 4s."
"Apple",5,"This is my first smart phone and I am learning how to use it. So far I can say that it is easier to store phone numbers in than a regular phone."
"Apple",5,"I chose this to replace a lost phone because of its comprehensive description which proved to be accurate. I had no trouble activating it and it seems to be functioning as expected. It came well packaged within the expected time frame."
"Apple",5,"The phone arrived quickly and looked like new. Works well!!"
"Apple",3,"My husband is a landscaper and he hadit for a week with the otterbox and it got damp not wet but damp in his pocket and it stopped working ."
"Apple",3,"The phone wasn't new like the listing had said, it works fine, but the left hand speaker is broken and it makes it sound weird."
"Apple",5,"Came in a timely manner! works perfect! had it for a month now and love it!"
"Apple",5,"This came in a timely manner. I am happy with my purchse"
"Apple",4,"The unit was a gift to my grandson. As of yesterday, it was working fine. There is a limitation in programming because Vzw will not provide all the perks as a used phone and not from their source. I would suggest that the purchase of a used iphone has such limitations, and not through the fault of a seller. This buy was a bargain, but I suspect Vzw and others wish to control how adaptable to changie like new assets of their phones should be, especially in older ones. Any way, a teenager gets some peer approval as well as features not on a flip model!"
"Apple",1,"Ear phones didnt work"
"Apple",4,"Like any bite this is a sweet apple"
"Apple",4,"as described"
"Apple",5,"great phone, takes the best photos ever,"
"Apple",3,"Good"
"Apple",1,"Phone looked great when it arrived, but when we went to activate it at the Verizon store, they said it couldn't connect to anything cellular. Completely defective, need to return now."
"Apple",4,"The VERY best. Thanks Steve Wozniak for what YOU began and YOUR creative genius - Apple. Steve Jobs was a marketing genius so do not credit him with the genius behind Apple engineering. This is a FABULOUS phone! Thanks for ALL of the H-A-R-D work 1000 employees of ""Project Purple."""
"Apple",1,"phone defective volume button does not work at all."
"Apple",5,"Device met my expectations and very great experience dealing with seller thank u"
"Apple",5,"Fabulous. So glad I updated my daughter's old flip phone to the 4S."
"Apple",5,"Great quality, and got here just in time to be my sister's Christmas present :)"
"Apple",1,"I am here to buy second-hand mobile phones, obviously open, repair, cell phone charge can only use continuously for an hour, most efficiency is 35, the inner problem still don't know how many goods, praise is so much, at the time said looks very new, bought, the screen is definitely not original factory and the screen has a small hole in the middle"
"Apple",2,"Does not stay charged, shuts down unexpectedly at inopportune times."
"Apple",4,"I got my phone even sooner than expected! I was very scared to buy something like this used. The only reason I didn't give it 5, was the charger. It came with a short and actually started smoking on the first night I used it. Kinda scary. Just replaced it and everything else works beautifully!"
"Apple",1,"i ordered a brand new Iphone 4S but instead i was supplyed a very badly refurbished one. There are signs that this has been used before. The metallic side strip is damaged in more than two places.The authorized apple store says it has Chinese parts and it is badly refurbished"
"Apple",3,"I bought this phone as an unlocked phone but later found upon revving it found out that it was locked with Verizon . I felt cheated because I was not expecting this from Amazon , seller of the phones ."
"Apple",5,"Straight forward and good purchase. Only complaint is that the charger that was included with the phone is fragile and doesn't work. Needed to get a new charger, but overall I was happy with the purchase."
"Apple",3,"everything jst as it said except for the lock phone which i have to spend a few more $ to get unlock"
"Apple",5,"Timing of product was great. It was here the first day it said it would be. I had a couple technical issues but the seller was in contact immediately to answers questions. Phone was in great condition and was in it original packaging like the description said. Overall this very pleasant to deal with and i hope to be able to purchase other products in the first"
"Apple",2,"The phone is in good condition the ear phone plug area is a little shaky. Overall the phone is working well."
"Apple",5,"Phone is almost pristine condition and works great . Exactly as it was advertised . Great price and worth it."
"Apple",1,"i got an amazon gift card when i did my taxes...that was my first mistake. once i got the card, i had to spend it...i looked at phones and ordered a cheap iphone...but after i month i realised it was not coming...i have asked for my money back..."
"Apple",5,"I love my new iPhone, I would recommend this to anyone looking to buy a smart phone. Such a great deal too. Thank you!"
"Apple",5,"Great phone! So I decided I'd had enough with Verizon's crap with my old plan, didn't want to lose my unlimited data, and didn't want to pay full retail price for a new phone to upgrade my wife's old Samsung first generation junker. So I made a vow to search Amazon for a good deal and sure enough one was found! No matter what you are looking for you can find it here!"
"Apple",4,"Just like the advertisement said, but the ""free"" case was pink... Seriously? Battery also seems shorter than typical even for an iPhone."
"Apple",4,"Its a great product but is a little on the fragile side given the amount of class in the phone."
"Apple",5,"Wonderful phone. One of the best phones I have ever had. I would recommend this to all of my friends and family."
"Apple",5,"prefect!amazing iphone .I love it,It is an amazing phone,great function and more details. The person is still very nice.All in all.nice job."
"Apple",3,"The iPhone 4s is pretty awesome, but it helps if the product wasn't reported lost or stolen when calling to activate it to my phone number."
"Apple",5,"Just love it, wonder what took me so long. Had to buy a book about ""how to"" and will learn Siri soon. Great product"
"Apple",5,"Thank you so much. Fast and works perfect. If I didn't fid that I don't think I would have gotten another iPhone"
"Apple",3,"I owned a smartphone prior to the iPhone. It was way more user friendly. The apps were more user friendly and all my music downloads and ring tones were free. The only thing I like better on my iPhone is the camera however I think the process to upload my photos is more difficult on the iPhone. I had thought face time would be nice but found out I could use an app with my smart phone that is free for face time."
"Apple",4,"I purchased this item as a xmas gift. I must say the item arrived way begore schedule. I checked out the authenticity and all was good. Im very happy."
"Apple",5,"On the phone while appearance a scratch and deficiency did not provide the directions, but does not affect the normal use, the price is very affordable."
"Apple",5,"Unfortunately my purse was stolen 3 weeks ago with everything in it including my iPhone.. I was at a loss.. Naturally I was very apprehensive about ordering a phone online because mine was stolen.. I have to say that I so completely pleased with the person I chose!!! The phone works great, had no issues activating it & arrived before I axle cited it to!! I would absolutely order from them again & refer them as well!! Thank you so much!!! :-)"
"Apple",4,"The Apple iPhone 4s is new, and I am still trying to learn how to use it. One thing I do not like about the phone is the difficulty adjusting the ear volume; I have just read online how to do it. I'll try later. I would apprecite it if Apple provided diagrams and detailed instructions. I do not feel that I should have to go out and buy a ""Dummies"" book to learn how to use an expensive smartphone.The design of the iPhone 4s is beautiful. The icons are colorful and bright. I very much like that I can watch the stock market on the phone. I am very surprised that it is so easy to hold in my small hand, and it is so light. It is a very comfortable phone to use.I can see that it can become an ""addictive"" tool for every day life: phone calls, messages, reminders, calendars, notes, ...."
"Apple",5,"I was very nervous about ordering this phone USED and ONLINE. Unseen. But I received it, and it is in great condition. Came with an old case, but I had already ordered an otterbox, so I replaced it quickly. I also downloaded the new IOS. So happy with this phone. Happy with the delivery. I've had an iphone before, so it feels good to be back."
"Apple",4,"I purchased this through Amazon's Warehouse deals. It was as described condition, little wear but looked like new in a case. I found after I had service that the i phone 4s has a glitch with the wi-fi turning grey. It makes the wi-fi unable to be turned on. I contacted apple to see if it just needed an upgrade and they let me know since it was not purchased through them there was nothing they could do. It was a manufacturer issue that would need to be replaced if I wanted wi-fi capabilities. I don't have unlimited data so it will not work for me. I contacted them and they were prompt in resolving my issue and when the phone arrives back they will give me a refund. I will try once more on purchasing the i phone 4s and hope it has working wi-fi."
"Apple",5,"This is an EARLY Xmas gift to my 13 yr old granddaughter, as a replacement for the one she had. Her old phone did not work properly anymore. I live in Kansas and she lives in Redwood City, CA...hence I was hopeful that the phone would be as it was described by the Seller. I have learned that except for getting it on their Verizon plan, my granddaughter is thrilled with her like-new phone. I am very grateful to the Seller and Customer Service who answered all of my Questions."
"Apple",5,"Phone is great. Just as described. Was a great sale works great this is rediculous having a limit of words"
"Apple",1,"THE phone works as advertised, but it is not possible to charge the battery. I will be sending it back for a replacement.Everet Beckner"
"Apple",2,"I got a white phone, while I ordered black. The speaker in the phone is very weak and hard to hear."
"Apple",5,"Delivered as promisedThe phone was exactly as it was advertisedwe were very happy with itNo problems to report"
"Apple",5,"Excellent phone!"
"Apple",2,"Phone appeared in perfect condition. Charger didn't work correctly, but we had another charger, so no big deal until we noticed that the battery doesn't hold it's charge very well, or at least it doesn't report it's percent very accurately. Phone will go from 30% to 1% in 5 minutes and then stay at 1% for several hours. Other times it will be at 80% and randomly shut off for no apparent reason. We're keeping it, as we don't want the hassle of returning it and being without a phone, but overall we're disappointed with it. After 6 months, we're still disappointed. Phone randomly shuts off and won't come back on unless plugged in, and then it comes back on with plenty of battery power left. This phone has been a lemon from day one. We've had other 4s phones that worked great-- disappointed in this one."
"Apple",5,"I bought a iphone 4s for verizon,off mbc mobile,it didn't really say if it was new or used,but It came,very quickly,brand new in the box! Everything included. I was worried because of some of the reviews,because I was just using it for tracfone,and so far everything is great! Thanks! Definitely recommend!"
"Apple",1,"Couldn't activate it..somethin was probably reprogrammed on the inside that's what Verizon said"
"Apple",5,"Work fine for the buck"
"Apple",5,"this is a great easy to use phone"
"Apple",5,"Received this iPhone in great time and in excellent condition and at a wonderful price. I am very happy with my purchase."
"Apple",5,"excellent, it met all my expectations.thanks you"
"Apple",2,"Phone uses twice as much battery in days time as other identical phones would like my money back!"
"Apple",1,"i ordered a ""refurbished"" phone... the phone i received is ""used""... it has scratches on the screen and noticeable imperfections on the case... i do not expect it to be perfect, but this product is not as described... please contact me for return or swap options..."
"Apple",5,"Works great"
"Apple",1,"I have tried contacting the seller numerous times about the phone echoing with incoming calls--we have tried re-setting the phone several times and it does not help."
"Apple",5,"muy bien"
"Apple",3,"The front facing camera was broken."
"Apple",4,"good product for the money"
"Apple",1,"this phone was sold by Diamond wireless as new but was defective. it wont connect to any wi-fi and the screen cracked while i was holding it in my hand. Furthermore when I was told to return it for a replacement ( $22.00 ) I'm being told they cant replace it because it is locked into an I cloud account witch was never done by me. I will definitely think twice about buying electronics online again. $234.88 plus $22. down the drain and I still have to go buy a phone. I've been robbed !!!"
"Apple",1,"I sold something bad did not come as the public did not come here in Venezuela released as he had written on their website so I really do not recommend it for anything other team was saying came back and used"
"Apple",5,"Does everything I want it to do."
"Apple",2,"Had to return it. Now no phone."
"Apple",1,"The mobile phone bought by me can not work in China no matter what method used. My friend is afraid of this phone is not a new one, but I bought it because it is a new one."
"Apple",1,"Not a iphone 4swas a iphone 4"
"Apple",5,"My daughter had to replace her phone. This phone was just like a brand new one and was cheaper. IPhone 4S is an excellent phone."
"Apple",5,"The phone works great I was scared at first for buying a phone on the internet but its great even when I thought it was the wrong phone and I messed up the were very polite and fast about my concern/ return request."
"Apple",5,"Great service. Good phone and we received it right away. Very satisfied."
"Apple",5,"What a great phone, would buy it again, very smart app's."
"Apple",5,"GREAT!!"
"Apple",5,"Is great phone love it"
"Apple",4,"I like it."
"Apple",5,"Great deal great phone"
"Apple",5,"Great Phone! My iPhone 5 started dropping calls / not receiving calls / everything going to voicemail before my 2 years were up and Verizon couldn't do anything about it. So this is my replacement and I love it. Little slower than the 5 but better size and works."
"Apple",5,"Great seller. I'm very satisfied."
"Apple",1,"I did not hold a charge and they gave me the wrong charger"
"Apple",4,"Locked on verizon"
"Apple",2,"Very Disappointed with this sound quality of this phone. The speaker is muffled when you have it on the speaker, it's like it has been blown and not refurbished. The speaker that you hold to your ear when you are making a phone call is also awful. My son and husband have the same phone so I know what the quality should be like and it's not here on my phone. I understand, I bought a used phone or refurbished phone but I am very disappointed with the quality of the speakers. The phone and glass was in good condition."
"Apple",4,"Arrived on time for Christmas. This iPhone was like new in pristine condition. The only reason for four stars is the charger and cable were not functioning. Once I replaced both with my iPod's the iPhone charged. It works perfectly and has already given many hours of fun to one of my grandsons, RMA was for want of cable and charger only so I did not return package because all or nothing and this unit was perfect on its own."
"Apple",5,"prompt delivery. great product"
"Apple",5,"Great condition and works great on tracfone"
"Apple",2,"The power button does not work, so I can't get updates etc. It is a real pain. I can return it-but then I have no business phone."
"Apple",1,"I bouhgt one unit and after install the sink card... THIS PHONE IS REPORTED AS STONLEDDIAMOND WIRELESS did not responde to phone calls and no responsable...Unfotunatilly as it's a not PRIME product Amazone do not responded for neither."
"Apple",5,"It is working great thanks."
"Apple",5,"The phone is in like-new condition and it was exactly as it was described! I am extremely happy with this purchase!"
"Apple",3,"Although this Verizon iPhone 4s is in great shape for a used one, I have not been able to use its international GSM capabilities abroad because has been blocked by Verizon with the complicity of Apple. The later does not unblock the iPhone without previous approval from Verizon; and Verizon does not unblock the international GSM capabilities of this units unless the owner (me or anyone) is a Verizon customer in good standing for at least two months. Sound like a monopoly? Seems unfair? Sure it is! I call Verizon Global Services and they told me that story and said that I should try that Amazon Warehouse (the seller) unblock it on my behalf. I tried to make it work with Kolbi 3.5G Costa Rican network, using its SIM card, buy the cellphone keep on asking Verizon unlocking code..."
"Apple",3,"I needed a new phone becuase I broke my other one. So I selected a new Iphone. I got this phone in the mail and everything on it works fine and runs like it should. As for the charger I got, It was a used charger and didnt work at charging my iphone. I contacted customer service and they told me to contact Apple. I contacted apple then went back to the seller to try and get my AC charger replaced or have them send me a new one. Niether has happened. Very disappointed in the customer who is selling this product. Bottom line is phone is great seller is terrible."
"Apple",5,"I received exactly what was promised, and in a timely manner. Recommend amazon to anyone. Will actually be purchasing another in the next couple of months."
"Apple",5,"We got an iPhone 4S and are very happy with the product. It came in an unopened package as advertised. We took it to Verizon and had no trouble getting our number transferred to it. Would definitely buy from these guys again."
"Apple",1,"very bad ,hull serious badly,sim locked ,no use,it need me waste much money for unlocking but verzion no supporting for unlocking ,sadly............"
"Apple",5,"As a first time iPhone owner I can't say why this phone is better than another. But I will thus far, i am impressed with my new [to me but used] iPhone 4S. Pictures are great, seems to be a decent speed for running applications. Even the ios7 seems to work good. The only drawback, like most phones, especially used, is the battery life. But overall I enjoy my Verizon Wireless Apple IPhone 4S."
"Apple",2,"It's not new, like they say, and I didn't receive the phone and the other acessories - if you want a new IPhone, don't buy wih them."
"Apple",2,"I got this iPhone right on time but there were many problems with that. Camera didn't work. All information from previous owner was their. Basically seller didn't clean up the phone and everything such as email contact numbers and etc we're there. I return the item and got my money back."
"Apple",5,"I am very satisfied with it, it, like new，The mobile phone is a lock，Can not use other companies do mobile phone card"
"Apple",5,"great buy, great product"
"Apple",5,"Perfect condition. Just as described by the seller. Works great at a fair price."
"Apple",4,"Nice phone for the price."
"Apple",1,"I purchased these phones because they were Verizon phones for my daughters. Today, when I went to go activate them at Verizon it was discovered they were not Verizon phones at all rather AT&T phones. I felt cheated and like this company misrepresented there product. Completely disappointed and do not want anyone else to go through this issue. I would give this negative stars but it made me give it at least one."
"Apple",1,"Horrible. Phone was DEF not new as described. Just the worse deal I have done on amazon"
"Apple",1,"The phone came with a dead battery that had to be replaced by the Apple store within the first week I owned the phone. It cost me $79 plus my time!"
"Apple",4,"I've had this phone for a few months now and I'm sop glad I made the swatch its pretty reliably and i don't have a lot of problems with it, Plus I was able to keep my current number which was a added bonus and it was cheaper than going though the Verizon store."
"Apple",5,"service was good and the phone worked well"
"Apple",5,"It is a great phone and it works fine."
"Apple",5,"I was seriously expecting a stolen phone because of the price, or at least an extremely abused phone. I was pleasantly surprised when it arrived in great condition and worked like a champ. The phone arrived with a new charging cable and a wall adapter."
"Apple",5,"I have a 5S for work so I wanted to pick this one up for personal use. I was surprised how quickly it linked with my iPad. The seller had it at my door in 3 days!"
"Apple",2,"It's doing great. We appreciate the honesty and yalls word about the phone. We will be dealing with amazon more. Thanks again."
"Apple",1,"I ordered it. It said Verizon phone unlocked but it would not work"
"Apple",3,"The phone I received is in great shape, but it is a GSM phone and will not work on Verizon. I am hoping this review will lead Amazon to change the product description."
"Apple",5,"great price, great phone, looks good and works perfectly,thanks."
"Apple",5,"Exactly as described!"
"Apple",1,"Broke down and had battery problems...WOULD NOT RECCOMEND THIS VENDOR"
"Apple",4,"Good condition, works well, except for home button which has to be pressed more firm, but is really great overall!"
"Apple",5,"Item returned but as described"
"Apple",5,"Nice"
"Apple",4,"Exactly what I wanted, why pay 5 or 6 hunderd for a new one when the older version does exactly what I wanted."
"Apple",5,"Phone came in perfect condition. No issues at all. Very happy."
"Apple",3,"This product was NOT new as the seller represented. Phone works well."
"Apple",2,"battery weak"
"Apple",3,"I got this iphone 4s Last year and the wifi didn't work i will never but a phone from them again. But ever thing else work on it."
"Apple",5,"love the phone"
"Apple",5,"Perfect condition!"
"Apple",5,"good"
"Apple",5,"The phone delivered on everything the posting promised! It works great and was offered at a great price!"
"Apple",4,"excellent value for the money. phones have worked well as starter phones for my 12 year old twins"
"Apple",5,"Great Value"
"Apple",1,"Returned it."
"Apple",2,"I was disappointed with the size of the damage on the top of the screen. A large part of the screen is missing. It had said there was a crack, but it's more like a chunck of the screen fell out."
"Apple",4,"I thought it would have come with a sim card"
"Apple",4,"Had a few problems with OS and had to replace battery after 2 years of use."
"Apple",5,"I received the Apple iPhone on time and the phone arrived as it was described. There were no visible scratches or anything. Dan was very helpful when it came to answering questions about the phone. Thanks!"
"Apple",5,"Product came as described, in excellent condition. Standard shipping was very fast. Ordered on the 12th and got the 15th. Got email same day I ordered saying it already shipped. Set up with Verizon already, and working great! Came set back to factor settings ready to go. Very pleased."
"Apple",4,"I received it right"
"Apple",4,"the item seems great thanks."
"Apple",1,"This phone would not completely charge....ever! If it was as much as 50% charged and I used it to take a picture or send a message, the charge would drop to zero. I returned it and the seller gave me a full refund. Just a lemon, I guess!"
"Apple",4,"After going through several android devices that even broke on me or just didn't have the feel for what I was looking for, I have finally found one that I seem to be pretty satisfied with. The battery life on this thing is amazing. Unlike my other phones that I would have to charge at least once or twice a day, this phone can last me all day before I really need to charge it."
"Apple",1,"The phone didn't work. I had to go through my insurance to get a new phone that worked and it cost me another $160"
"Apple",5,"I purchased this for my neice because the one I bought for my son at Christmas from this same seller was great! It arrived just like new in case with charger and shrink wrapped- presented like new. I was so impressed. I will purchase from this seller again if needed!"
"Apple",1,"I was very unsatisfied with this product when I received it. It was not a 4S at all, as advertised. I was purchasing this from a private party though. I was however very pleased with Amazon with their rapid response to my complaint. I notified Amazon as soon I received this product and they refunded my money."
"Apple",5,"This company was truly on the roll. The phone looked brand new. The order was at my door in about 3 days. They also responded to my questions right away before I made the purchase and that made me fill even better about ordering from this company. I up the phone will function as well as this companies service. :)"
"Apple",5,"This purchase exceeded my expectations. I was a little afraid of buying a phone other than new but this phone was in great shape and I had no problems with the hook up."
"Apple",5,"the product is very newly,i very like it ,i think it is a good product,it can become my best phone"
"Apple",2,"The WIFI has a problem，can`t work.and the battery is very bad,only can work a few hours. is a bad shopping."
"Apple",5,"The only problems is: The I-phone doesn't continue to remind you that you missed a telephone call. The ring tone could be elevated. It is too soft."
"Apple",2,"I recieved the phone and it only worked for about a month then it wouldnt ring on the phone text or alarm settings."
"Apple",4,"Since there are already a lot of reviews of the phone I'm going to focus on the experience of buying a refurbished one. The phone arrived in a used iPhone 4s box that had seen better days. Inside the box was a plastic tray with a single compartment containing the phone. The compartment was much larger than the phone, so the device was not actually secure in the packaging. Under the try I found the charger and a small booklet as expected. I buy a lot of refurbished electronics and it looks like in this case the seller may use the term refurbished a bit loosely based on the packaging. The phone was in good condition, but I had some trouble finding the ESN. It was on a label on the outside of the box and for some reason someone had placed another label over it making the numbers hard to read. Fortunately the ESN is available on an iPhone in the About screen on the phone. Activating was easy and this replaced my current phone rather than requiring a new line.The phone is in good condition and the battery seems fine. In retrospect, I saved a bit of money over buying from the manufacturer, but would probably feel a bit more comfortable about the device had I gone that route instead."
"Apple",1,"they said phone is new but registered from someone else and phone is broken and screen has been changed!!"
"Apple",1,"Microphone doesn't work to make or receive calls"
"Apple",5,"I was replacing a lost 4s and this was exactly the thing I needed. Good description and the unit performs well."
"Apple",5,"D"
"Apple",5,"has some dents but overall good condition"
"Apple",5,"Great phone for granddaughter."
"Apple",5,"i like phone"
"Apple",5,"Great.. Fast shipment"
"Apple",5,"Excellent phoneWas brand new never open"
"Apple",1,"good, buy iphone 4s which line the place you do not take'm from Venezuela, the same as when you bought it told me that it was released for all the online right now as I have my iphone paperweight ..... I hope your reply as soon as possible."
"Apple",5,"Very happy with this purchase. Works with all my iPod equipments, plugs and chargers. The 5s as I understand it has different plugs so this was better for me."
"Apple",5,"My son thanks you, the product is as described."
"Apple",5,"Exactly as advertised, arrived quickly."
"Apple",4,"Could not use with my straight talk sim card but I returned and enjoyed the quick customer service."
"Apple",2,"I dot like it,the i phone belongs the people,you send me the bad thing I want to my money back"
"Apple",1,"this turned out to be counterfeit. after multiple problems took it to Apple Store to be fixed and they showed me all the fake Chinese parts with red writing on them... was still registered to some other woman in another state. Super sketchy and a pain in the butt experience. oh and i phones suck. I dropped it and the screen cracked after 2 weeks."
"Apple",5,"Nice iphone shipped to me very quickly"
"Apple",5,"this is a great phone, I am a huge iphone fan. I am very pleased with this purchase."
"Apple",4,"Product arrived on time and as advertised. Purchased this as a back up phone for my wife. This was purchased from there Amazon Warehouse clearance returns and it worked perfectly. Got a great deal too!"
"Apple",1,"Phone is not unlocked as sold. Unfortunately as I left for the UK shortly after buying it, I have misssed my return window. Next time I'll set fire to $200 instead. BUYER BEWARE."
"Apple",5,"Phone came in excellent condition. Shipping was quicker than posted. I got this phone for my son who broke his old one.....as of now he seems pleased with his replacement. Also came with the usb cable."
"Apple",4,"Phone works fine with everything, just the battery issue, it dies too quickly. I dont know if its all 4s or just this one. Over all the phone is fine. Thanks."
"Apple",5,"After not having good luck with the first phone I ordered, I was very happy with this phone. The phone's condition is just as expected. Used but in very good condition."
"Apple",1,"These phones are all non apple/genuine parts usually of cheaper quality. You are not getting a genuine iphone. Even the glass is a cheaper glass."
"Apple",1,"I bought this phone used from Amazon Warehouse deals and paid a premium over other vendors because it was sold by Amazon. Unfortunately, I was unable to activate this phone. Despite the seller's saying they tested the phone, it was reported lost or stolen to Verizon. As a result, I had to return it and get another phone. Lots of time wasted and my son still doesn't have a phone.I am very disappointed."
"Apple",5,"The phone arrived with all of the original packaging and materials. The earbuds and charger appeared to be brand new. The phone itself had no marks whatsoever and appeared to be barely ""used"". It was as described.I am still getting used to an iPhone after being a Droid user, but the phone itself and the seller were just as advertised."
"Apple",3,"You'll need to carefully inspect items from this seller as soon as they arrive. One of the iPhones I bought definitely had a defective battery, and I caught that early on and sent I back for repair. Now I see that the black phone's battery won't even last through the day, and will need to be replaced, also."
"Apple",5,"I love it so much its really great. Im happy i ordered from this place. five stars is an understatement."
"Apple",5,"My hubby is an old dinosaur who didn't want to give up his Blackberry, my sons and I purchased the refurbished iPhone 4 and now he's in love with the phone which arrived promptly and in excellent condition."
"Apple",5,"How can one write a bad review of the 4S iphone? It works. It works. It works for me anyway."
"Apple",4,"All good! Item as described - even came with a bonus case. Would have no problem dealing with this trader again."
"Apple",5,"Product arrived on time and looks as good as new, my daughter loves it and I couldn't be happier with the purchase"
"Apple",1,"i dislike because they sold an broken phone to me and this phone is locked on the verizon so it cant use other sim cards"
"Apple",5,"This phone is really great and I love having it. It basically does everything that I need it to and more"
"Apple",4,"it can't unlock,but the phone is great good.12 more words required. Apple iPhone 4S 16GB (Black) - Verizon How do you rate this product?"
"Apple",5,"The phone came so fast, like within a week. It was shipped right after the holidays. It has the same description like stated. Clean, co scratches. It was so frustrating when my phone got stolen on Christmas week. So I was looking and searching to buy a phone with an affordable price. The price was good and I needed a phone."
"Apple",5,"Came just as advertised brand new! Was a Xmas present to my daughter. Got it set up and works just great , I already have 2 others so I knew what to expect and seller was very quick on delivery. Would buy again!"
"Apple",5,"This iPhone 4s worked good, but it looked like refurbished. I bought this for my friend in China, and she liked it very much."
"Apple",5,"The phone is just as it was described! It even came in two days sooner than expected! Thanks a bunch!"
"Apple",1,"I received it and after a day of use it immediately start freezing and having ""command delays"" like I'll press ""safari"" and it'll take a min or 2 to come up and I'll get contacts instead so yeah."
"Apple",5,"Thanks"
"Apple",4,"Good piece of technology."
"Apple",5,"The phone shipped fast, and was in just out of the box condition. 100% worth the $100, and saved quite a bit as oppose to buying a 5s or 6 in like condition."
"Apple",1,"The phone did not work. Had to return it."
"Apple",1,"Unhappy ,don't know how to return it back The seller"
"Apple",1,"Went to have phone activated and it was blocked because it was reported as stolen.VERY dissatisfied"
"Apple",5,"Quality iphone."
"Apple",1,"This listing is deceiving. I just got off the phone with Apple to find out the device was purchased back in October not June as my purchase order was made. This makes a difference in the warranty as the device you are purchasing may not be under standard warranty or may be previously used."
"Apple",1,"came from UK,voice mail locked to UK......software corrupted.......in short......crap"
"Apple",1,"Had the iPhone for 3 weeks when it started to turn off on its own. Unable to restart. It keeps showing the blinking apple and when it does finally work I'm unable to send a text or use any applications. This is my only phone so my frustration is very high. Tried connecting it to iTunes and it corrupted my iTunes account and when I tried to delete and reinstall iTunes, it put a virus in my computer. What a mess! Very Displeased!"
"Apple",5,"Great phone love it it's just like the owner said new phone works good I love this kind of phone"
"Apple",1,"When I tried to activate the phone, I was told the phone had been reported lost or stolen, so obviously could not be used. The only positive thing I can say is that the seller did refund the purchase with minimal hassle."
"Apple",4,"The battery can be used only half an day when listen music or watch movie or play games. If in the standy model, it can be used for one day."
"Apple",5,"Arrived in excellent condition!! Functions flawlessly and worked right out of the box for my mother's Christmas gift. Worth it"
"Apple",2,"Had a 5, lost it and replaced with a 4. Poor choice though cheaper. Calendar always out of sync for time zone, not user friendly."
"Apple",5,"This seller was great even sent me an upgrade phone from what was in the desciption. Didn't arrive on the date it was suppose to but he refunded me some of my money back. i would definitly recomend this seller to anyone. They were very understanding and would take care of any issues you have. I would defenitly go back to this seller for any of my wireless needs. Also this seller is very good about contacting you if needed. Very Happy with the phone everything works and looks like its brand new. I would actually rate this seller on scale 1-10 i would rate them a Big 8 because evrything almost went as planed thanks so much for everthing. Kevin"
"Apple",4,"The speaker for the phone didn't work at first, but after a cleaning it worked like new. Pretty happy with the purchase."
"Apple",1,"I bought an Iphone 4s and can not talk on it because the mic does not work!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!This is the way the phone came."
"Apple",1,"my wifi for the phone is not turning on anymore, you gave me a useless phone and now I have to get a new phone"
"Apple",5,"Works great"
"Apple",5,"I previously had an iPhone 4, but the device had a ""Mind of it's own"": the screen would go ""black"" then come back on at will. I tried all software resets, but, I bought this used iPhone 4S for less than having the the older model repaired."
"Apple",3,"the home its wrong"
"Apple",5,"Better than I had hoped. - great deal! Wish I had bought two"
"Apple",5,"was new"
"Apple",1,"I bought this phone which was listed as NEW. It came in an unsealed iphone 4 box, it is a 4S phone. I sent an email and they gave me $10 credit. The headphones that came with the phone are knock offs and have horrible sound. I am pretty sure this phone was refurbished and am disappointed they could list it as NEW. I would not have bought a refurbished or used phone. After a few months the power button no longer works and once the screen froze there is nothing I could do to power it down."
"Apple",5,"Works great!"
"Apple",5,"Exactly as advertised. Great."
"Apple",5,"Exactly as advertised"
"Apple",3,"IT WAS OK FOR A YEAR, BUT SLOWED DOWN AFTER THAT"
"Apple",4,"With the holidays and such the item was slow in getting to me. But once it came it lived up to my expectations."
"Apple",1,"Not only was this not an iphone 4s (it was an iphone 4), when we decided to keep it anyway and activate it, Verizon refused to activate it as it was listed as a lost or stolen phone. This was a Christmas gift and pretty much ruined Christmas for us. We returned it and received a refund. I used amazon instead of buying locally to avoid this type of situation. I was told I would be given an amazon credit for all of my trouble and have yet to see that."
"Apple",5,"I had a droid phone that I switched for this one. It took me a few days to get used to it but I really love it. This phone is my first Iphone so my review may not be all that fair. I noticed that most of the apps that I had running on my previous phone seemed to run better on this phone, plus this phone had Siri. She's really fun to have.I only had one complaint about the phone itself. In the text messaging it doesn't have a colored flashing light to let you know that you have messages waiting. It's not a deal breaker though. I can adapt! Overall this is a really great phone."
"Apple",5,"Got to me in great timing, was hekoed quickly and efficiently when a problem arose with activting it. It's like brand new, I could recommend the store to anyone, great quality in everthing! Thank You!"
"Apple",2,"Bought this to replace a stolen phone.Hoping to fill my contact, and longer, with this replacement phone.Bad luck with a bad replacement phone.Ripped off twice."
"Apple",5,"I received my iphone 4s within 3 days and in very good condition as it was described in the ad. It was almost brand new and no cosmetic blemishes whatsoever. When I went to activate the phone on my existing Verizon account there were no issues at all, everything worked out wonderfully!. I'm very satisfied"
"Apple",1,"It was advertised as a Verizon phone but in reality it was a sprint phone. Completely useless to me considering my provider is Verizon."
"Apple",1,"I was looking for a NEW Iphone and purchased from KJ Industries because they said they had a new one. When we got the phone it had pictures on it and we weren't able to activate the phone, because Sprint said it was stolen. I contacted Amazon, and they said I had to go through the seller. He did contact me to say that he had to get the phone first before he gave me my 300.00 back. The phone was delivered to his home a few days ago and I have not heard anything yet. I am going to contact them next. I am very disappointed that this is a seller of amazon and he can get away with selling stolen phones."
"Apple",1,"I received the phone and when version went to activate they could not. They figured an old balance was still on the account"
"Apple",1,"Although purchased through a company that stated that they ensure the phone worked... there was still a number attached to it and therefore could not be activated. I had to return the phone. Still waiting on credit, but it has only been a little more than a week."
"Apple",5,"I have had this phone for 6 months now and it is still great. Considering an upgrade to the 6 but I am only holding off because i LOVE this one so much :)"
"Apple",5,"quality product ,seemed new in every way would not hesitate to be a repeat customer"
"Apple",3,"Box ID numbers belonged to a phone owned & active under another persons account. Plus somebody's personal info was not cleared or phone not reset . Verizon customer service helped find the true ID in the phone itself & got it activated."
"Apple",4,"I love it."
"Apple",1,"DO NOT DO BUY. This company is operated by thieves. Like many others, the phone I received did not meet the description. It was NOT a Verizon phone, nor was it unlocked. It was a sprint locked phone with previous users data! Spend a few more dollars and get something that works. Stay far away, learn from my mistake."
"Apple",5,"wonderful works good."
"Apple",5,"Works beautifully"
"Apple",5,"Just as described Fast shipping Thank you"
"Apple",5,"Fast delivery and product as described. Seller was good to work with. Very pleasant experience."
"Apple",5,"I am very satisfied with the product. It looks and works like a new phone."
"Apple",1,"Said it was new and still in box but it has had many issues already pretty disappointing, would not buy again"
"Apple",5,"Excellent!"
"Apple",5,"I was fortunate to find this at a fabulous price. The seller was A++++. The phone is like new and works perfectly. I couldn't be more pleased with the product, price or service.Elsewhere in September after leaving my Motorola Droid on a plane, I purchased an iPhone 4S 8GB for $45 more than this one. A faulty transformer wall attachment that came with the cable FRIED my phone after I had successfully used it for 2 months. No one's fault... just a LEMON wall plug. I sent the case to my grandson and had his 4S phone ""guts"" put in my nice case because his screen was cracked so at least some good came of it."
"Apple",5,"Awesome awesome awesome. I would definitely purchase from this company again."
"Apple",5,"Great price, and the seller was very helpful! This was a gift for our daughter for Christmas. Thank you!"
"Apple",5,"Excellent"
"Apple",5,"Good phone the only problem volume too low"
"Apple",5,"very good!"
"Apple",5,"fast shipment ! love the phone it works great with my Verizon contract!"
"Apple",5,"I have never had a smart phone before and I absolutely love this. It came so quickly and is absolutely a blast to use. Thank you."
"Apple",5,"iPhone 4s it does what it is supposed to and was in excellant condition when I got it."
"Apple",5,"Great sale!"
"Apple",5,"Very nice phone. It is a good as new and works perfectly."
"Apple",3,"It worked for a couple weeks and then one of the speakers went out on it. No one can hear me talk on the phone unless I have it on speaker phone. Pain. In. The. Butt. I went from one broken phone to another. Not exactly pleased with that."
"Apple",5,"In great shape for a used phone, works just fine."
"Apple",5,"Amazing coustemer service. Helped my a lot with all my questions.At the end they were able to solve me problem."
"Apple",5,"It was shipped to my house within three days. No bruises and cracks were on the phone. All the information they provided about the phone was correct. Transfer my Verizon line to the phone without a problem and didn't have to pay any fees or get a new contract. I will purchase another phone in the future with them when my phone become more out of date."
"Apple",1,"Despite it being advertised as coming UNLOCKED, the phone was LOCKED on receipt. So be careful when ordering!!!!!!!!So star rating is a one!"
"Apple",5,"Had to replace my daughter's lost/stolen iPhone 5. Looked for a 4s due to cost. This phone was slightly more than the other 4s's on Amazon, but the description indicated it was in very good shape. It arrived on time and was in excellent condition with all accessories. Hated having to buy another iphone, but very pleased with this seller and the whole transaction."
"Apple",4,"After going from an iPhone 4 to a Samsung Galaxy 4, I decided within 6 months to go back to an iPhone. Apple really knows how to do it right and I will continue to be an iPhone fan."
"Apple",3,"Not sure yet... as a staunch android user, I want to give it a chance."
"Apple",5,"Shipped quickly and functions perfectly."
"Apple",5,"So far so good the phone came in great condition. everything works as advertised but I only had it for few days but like I said it's as advertised"
"Apple",1,"The phone arrived as expected but the phone could not work on the Verizon network. I had to return the phone. The seller processed the return with no problem"
"Apple",5,"Meets expectation"
"Apple",2,"Without adding any apps, battery life lasted for maybe three quarters of a day. Had to use speaker or headphones to place or receive voice calls as normal ear speaker did not work."
"Apple",2,"Battery will not hold a charge and cant be replaced Had only 3 weeks."
"Apple",1,"Shuts off every 5 minutes"
"Apple",5,"Arrived on time in excellent condition! Thank you so much! I would definitely purchase again!"
"Apple",1,"Sadly I had three of these phones that were marketed as brand new but when I had trouble with them and took them to verizon, Because it didn't work right, I was told I was the third person that had activated the phone."
"Apple",5,"EXCELLENT CUSTOMER SERVICE. WOULD BUY AGAIN. PROFESSIONAL CUSTOMER FEEDBACK. THANK-YOU."
"Apple",1,"Rec'd what was sold as a brand new iPhone 4s, looks real. Verizon was unable to connect to the phone they said it must be ""locked by a 3rd party"". Apple was unable to connect to the phone, said it must be ""locked by a 3rd party"". I am afraid it is a bootlegged iPhone. I sent it back for a refund."
"Apple",1,"the phone don""t work well some apk. gone away very easy like facebook and messenger I can""t use it very much so I""m unhappy to buy the phone"
"Apple",4,"The phone was in good condition as described by the seller. The only problem I experienced was that I had difficulty with it the Wi-Fi and the screws to open the phone were stripped."
"Apple",5,"It did come in as a new phone"
"Apple",1,"It didn't work."
"Apple",5,"Product arrived quickly in box wrapped in original packaging from the factory. Works well so far. The price was wonderful. A great way to take my non tech savvy mother over to the world of a smart phone. I am pleased."
"Apple",4,"Use on Tracphone and it work well. However, battery on Iphones don't hold a charge long."
"Apple",2,"Ok, I know its 2016 and I just bought a phone that is ~4 years old but, my Android was in its last days and I didn't want to get into another long term financing agreement with Verizon so I made the jump to Apple yesterday and thought the 4s was a good way to see if I like iphone. Price was good, arrived next day as promised by DigitalandMore and it is brand new in factory package. Activated the phone easily. First call I receive, I can barely hear the caller, second call same thing... I turn up every volume button I can find and finally resort to Google. Well, guess what? Common problem with 4s so I've tried every potential solution I could find online and still no better. I will be reaching out to seller to work out a return but want you all to know of this issue that never showed up in reviews until I specifically searched ""low call volume."""
"Apple",1,"please do not buy from this seller, the phone was not a new phone, it actually had been activated in Hong Kong years ago per Apple consultant. The box and phone had different MEID numbers. Neither Verizon nor Apple could activate the phone after 5 hours of trying everything they could."
"Apple",5,"I have used the phone for some days.I love it. Two dins as discribed. No other problems. Thanks a lot!"
"Apple",5,"very good"
"Apple",5,"I received the iPhone quickly and in GREAT shape. I could not even tell it was used. I would recommend buying a phone here to anyone and would do it again if I need/want too."
"Apple",5,"Best phone I have ever had!!!! I thought it would be hard to switch from and android phone to apple, but I was wrong!!! I love my iPhone!!!"
"Apple",4,"I love my iPhone. I would recommend it to anyone. My only complaint is that Siri is not very intuitive and can be difficult, or sometimes impossible, to work correctly."
"Apple",5,"I purchased this and got it within a week. The cord was not working. I sent a note via Amazon to the buyer, he responded in 5 minutes, and he replaced the cord with a new one within a week! I am loving this device, though refurbished, I couldn't tell if this was new or refurbished. Iphones are the best and stream to your other apple products with ease!"
"Apple",5,"Worked really hard to find a price that would fit my budget and found this 16GB"
"Apple",2,"The phone was supposed to be new but it clearly wasn't. The battery is shot and drains itself completely in about an hour. And when I plugged it into the computer there was already someone's name associated with it."
"Apple",4,"I was anti iphone but I do like it there a few things that i had on my android that i cant get on this but ill learn to live with it"
"Apple",3,"It's a phone. The battery is poor and only lasts about 24 hours with low level usage. The screen is unresponsive in the lower left hand corner when the phone is held vertical. The charging cord that came with it doesn't work at all. I have to use the cord from my ipad to charge it. Screen changes occur without input from me making usage awkward at times. It must have been an imperfect phone."
"Apple",2,"Bought 2 as new, however, 1 battery barely holds a charge leading me to believe it may have been refurbished or used."
"Apple",1,"Battery was shot"
"Apple",1,"Not a Verizon phone! Looks good but I can not use because it's not a Verizon phone. Very disappointed"
"Apple",1,"As it says, Verizon 4s ... I just went to verizon wireless to get my number transferred over, turns out I cant because it says in the general info that it is a sprint phone. So much for my excitement when I saw the package on my door step..."
"Apple",5,"wife loves it ... thanks"
"Apple",1,"This is a brocken refurbished product..is dead..i want my money back"
"Apple",1,"Well, I ordered an iPhone 4s, but I got a plain iPhone 4. They look similar but, now I can't update to IOS 9 (stuck with IOS 7). I double checked and sure enough, I ordered a 4s, the delivery box said 4s, but the reseller packaged iPhone 4!"
"Apple",3,"My microphone had water damage"
"Apple",5,"Good"
"Apple",5,"Still works great."
"Apple",5,"i bought a replacement phone for my fiancee because her phone was pretty much worthless and i knew she liked iphones - so i got the 4s for a replacement until our next upgrade. i am really glad i purchased it off of amazon - they sent the phone really fast and it was as described. i almost thought the phone was brand new because it was in that good of shape. activating it was easy and now she is good to go with her new phone. the 4s is a decent phone but the whole buying a used cell phone on amazon was a very smooth and painless process! would do again if needed."
"Apple",1,"Phone was supposed to be new.Battery will only charge if phone is completely powered off and then it takes about 8 hours or more to charge to 75% or so. Clearly not functional for many people to have to leave their phone off 1/3 of the day. Don't know how long a time it might be before before I plug it in to find it won't charge at all.Would not be so angry if it had not been presented as brand new. I could have taken my chances and bought a used or refurbished one for a much lower price that might have actually worked properly. Also angry about the amount of time I am going to have to spend trying to deal with this issue again, as like most people, I need a working phone, and this one is obviously defective.It appears from the reviews I am not the only one who has been cheated by this particular seller.Pretty pathetic way to make money I would say."
"Apple",1,"Bad from the start! Arrived late, and when it did it literally was crusted with some unknown substance. There were also scratches and strange brown spots at the edge of the case. Not as advertised. I emailed them about it and they basically called me a liar. I sold the phone to a person in my office at a $50 dollar loss just not have to deal with this company again. He is cleaning the scum off it as I write this. Disgusting."
"Apple",2,"wifi is bad,wifi grayed out, I can not use this feature phone,I was very disappointed with the 4s.How can I do it"
"Apple",1,"Purchased this phone on July 19th, 2013. It was listed as in ""new"" condition. The phone occasionally failed to switch on, but I was able to get it to activate by holding down both buttons for 15 seconds or so. Finally on or about January 25th, 2014 it failed to switch on and I could not get it to activate. Took it to Verizon ( where I had previously taken it when it would not activate) and they too could not get it to open. I was advised by you that the phone was out of warranty. Took it to the Apples Store ( a 180 mile round trip from my home) where they quickly brought it back by removing the battery and then replacing the same battery. ( basically re-booting)The Apple technician was able to tell me that the phone was originally purchased from Apple in mid 2012 at a store in Las Vegas and that it showed signs of having been ""refurbished.""Given that supposition I would find it very hard to rate this provider other than one star. I am very disappointed."
"Apple",1,"Phone was broken, home button did not work, volume and speaker didn't work. The phone was randomly freeze. It was con"
"Apple",5,"The giftee LOVE's this phone more than her friends 5S. She had no problem getting this phone activated with Verizon once she took it to a corporate store. Activation could not be done online and the one Verizon reseller she went to wouldn't touch it."
"Apple",1,"When i received the phone I found that the top button did not click and now i have to use the accessibility feature to turn it off. Also the battery life, even when all apps are closed and screen is shut off, is horrible."
"Apple",5,"Ordered from Mango Wireless in like new condition. Phones came as described. New and in original boxes. Only issue was they put a T-mobile SIM card in one of the phones i ordered which are Verizon. Simple fix just had to remove the card. Contacted the seller but still no response. However I am very pleased with my order and haven't had any other problems since."
"Apple",5,"Great phone....exactly what I was looking for. Seller was spot on on what phone offered. More of a beginner iPhone but as an experienced user I like the simple ness."
"Apple",3,"The phone arrived faster than the estimated delivery date..Great. Man lOl the phone was wrapped with paper towel, that was funny. Guess the person couldnt afford bubble wrap or whatever smh. I had to clean the iPhone, s*** was dirty as hell not Great. Other than that, the phone works fine for now. Battery dies fast to me though.."
"Apple",4,"We bought this phone to replace a 4S that we had that cracked. I was hesitant to purchase a cell phone through Amazon but turned out fine! Works as well as the one we pd over $300 for 2 yrs ago. The phone looked new - no scratches - no damage of any type. The only bad thing was the wall charger had a cut in the cord. It looked like a knife or box cutter type cut down to the actual wire but not through the wires. It didn't effect the use of the charger - it still worked fine but just for safety reasons we just tossed it back in the box and are using our previous charger. So this wasn't a big deal to us because we had an additional charger but I know this would be irritating to many. But I'm giving this 4 stars because the phone itself was like a new quality and shipped really quick. Packaging was also very good - it came in a 4S new looking box with the ear buds and charger. Overall happy with purchase."
"Apple",4,"great"
"Apple",5,"I got this to work with Tracfone. Exactly as described and arrived very quickly. Love it!"
"Apple",5,"Came in time, was all it was supposed to be"
"Apple",3,"Well, what to say? Its adapt good, do the job... But, what do you expect for that price? I wish it look better."
"Apple",5,"This too was a gift and my son loves it and has no problem with it at all"
"Apple",1,"I took this phone to two different Verizon stores, and they were unable to activate it. I am very grateful for Amazon's return policy, when I took action to return it a shipping label (i.e., free return shipping) was provided to me and once the phone was returned, I received a refund for the cost of the phone as well as the shipping costs.Because I was still phone-less when this phone would not activate, I went to a phone repair shop and picked up a similar phone for a similar price. If you have lost or broken your phone and need a replacement, I recommend you check out the local phone repair shops first - they may have a temporary solution until you are eligible for an upgrade."
"Apple",1,"Battery didn't last long"
"Apple",5,"Great Phone! Better price than at any store in my city. Meets all my expectations!"
"Apple",5,"Excellent"
"Apple",1,"It didn't work on Verizon. I had to send it back."
"Apple",5,"Does exactly what I want and works with TracFone."
"Apple",5,"Awesome Phone! I love my purchase. Works easily and it's small and light to carry with me."
"Apple",3,"Came quick . I did need to purchase a new battery because the one in the phone was drained ."
"Apple",1,"I bought this to use on verizon and it is not activated for verizon so i have to send it back and get another phone. pain in the neck, i do not recommend this company."
"Apple",5,"Amazing phone love it 😀"
"Apple",5,"Good quality replacement for an old lost iphone"
"Apple",5,"Love IT!!"
"Apple",5,"Reasonable cost for a fully capable 4S, in excellent shape...."
"Apple",5,"I got this phone on time. Everything works on the phone. I went to paid plus and have it signed up the next day. There was no problem at all. I will buy me an phone soon (I bought this one for my wife). Everything work fine and I am very glad that I brought this phone and I am looking on getting my phone from them. I read about people getting sucked by someone but I am very, very happy that I got my wife this phone."
"Apple",5,"my grand chiid lost his phone, this is a replacement. if he loses this one its on him and he will have to go to work."
"Apple",5,"Wife had a basic phone, and wanted to upgrade to what the rest of family had (iPhones)... Wasn't due for upgrade for another year, so we went this route...I emailed the dealer regarding the condition, and if verizon was not able to activate the phone ,was I able to return (yes I could)... Phone is in excellent condition, and within 20 minutes verizon had it activated and on line ...no problems, shipped quickly, and would go this route again if needed"
"Apple",4,"Everything we expect in a phone. The only issue is short battery life because it doesn't last a full day of use, we had to purchase a mobile charging station."
"Apple",5,"This is by far the best phone I have ever owned. There are some things I wish came right on the phone and other things I wish I could just take off of the phone, but over all the phone works great and I love it nonetheless."
"Apple",5,"My iphone was stolen and I needed to replace it. This was a great price. Came in earlier than estimated. And the scratch that was on the back I couldn't even find. It looks brand new."
"Apple",2,"I did get USB but not the two pin power adapter. I was not expecting head set, which was not there but the power cord pin is a must."
"Apple",5,"When I ordered the phone it gave about a 2 weeks notice on when it might arrive. It arrived before the first day which made me happy. It came with an otter box which wasn't in very good shape but I already ordered another one and it also came with a zagg shield which has been very nice. The phone is overall in great condition just a few minor dings on the side but I was expecting that since it was used. Good experience."
"Apple",5,"My phone arrived the very next morning after I ordered it, in perfect condition and is awesome!! Amazon rocks and I'll always keep coming back!"
"Apple",3,"The seller stated the phone was in good condition and that the phone was being sold with conversion kit and original white cover. It was altered by apple with a green conversion kit. The phone had a few scratches on the edges but most importantly the seller did not state that all pictures taken with the cameras flash on have a green light on them from the conversion kit. Also the original white case was not included."
"Apple",1,"Ugh! Had terrible issues with mail delivery delays and then when it arrived, it had not been reset and was unusable. How can that even happen?"
"Apple",5,"Very happy! Quick delivery and everything perfect! Thanks"
"Apple",2,"OK"
"Apple",3,"just so so！What I bought is an used like new iphone 4s on the warehouse deals. The condition of the item is just so so, not very good or bad. But I used it well. It has not any problems."
"Apple",5,"A+"
"Apple",1,"Cannot hear caller so must use speaker or earbuds. Now callers can't hear me."
"Apple",5,"Nice"
"Apple",5,"Great item! Thank you so much!"
"Apple",5,"Liked the phone."
"Apple",5,"Came just as listed, no scratches and in perfect condition. Honestly the best you can ask for at such a low price."
"Apple",1,"Simply put, the phone didn't work. I brought it to Apple who said it wasn't new (as advertised) but rather it was an old phone made to look new. They looked up the details and said they had dealings with this seller before. Don't buy from Vantage Cellular."
"Apple",5,"fascinante, very nice"
"Apple",5,"I was pleasantly surprised my 13yr old lost his cell. Verizon wasn't able to provide another 4s at the time. I searched around and found a new phone never used before here on Amazon. It worked out very well, I was able to activate with Verizon no problems at all. I kept waiting for something to go wrong or fail with the phone but it didn't."
"Apple",5,"Everything is awesome"
"Apple",5,"Perfect condition. Thank You"
"Apple",1,"I was sold a device that stopped working after just a few days. The device began to randomly turn off. I took it to the Verizon store and they managed to reset it. Their diagnostic found nothing wrong with it. Then it happened again a few days ago. I took it to the Apple store and they said ""defective hardware"". Apple warranty replaced it for $199.00. Now I am out double the money because this vendor re-sold someone else's defective device."
"Apple",2,"This phone needs a lot more work than I anticipated."
"Apple",5,"Great!"
"Apple",1,"it have many problem about it ( the speaker have broken)"
"Apple",4,"4 plus year old model works as expected. Good solid feel. Replacing same era Windows phone that no longer plays all CNN and YouTube videos. There are also 10 apps on iPhone I use that are not available for Windows phone.Office ,Onenote, and Onedrive are all available on iPhone."
"Apple",4,"Just as advertised. Arrived promptly."
"Apple",5,"I bought it to use on the ""Tracfone"" program. Very Successful!"
"Apple",5,"Phone was great I love it"
"Apple",1,"iPhone had burned out atenna"
"Apple",5,"exactly as described"
"Apple",5,"Great phone and a really good price. my husband is very pleased with this purchase and this is good because the 4s is our first iphone and we weren't sure if we would like it. Seller gave a product that met expectations and the shipping time was also great. Thank you"
"Apple",5,"Excellent"
"Apple",3,"so far so good"
"Apple",3,"The batteries are a bit temperamental and don't hold a charge for a full day."
"Apple",5,"love it, works great"
"Apple",1,"bought a used phone and it doesnt work post said it works fine but doesnt.. now i cant get a hold of the guys and i got ripped off"
"Apple",5,"Received this phone today. Everything about it is perfect, clean esn, no scratches, scuffs or anything. Very pleased !"
"Apple",5,"works greats."
"Apple",5,"Very fast priority shipping and good item."
"Apple",5,"Great"
"Apple",5,"Exactly as described. We will buy another. When they say refurbished like new, it's true. There is virtually no way to know it wasn't brand new. This seller was fantastic, delivered on time, device was better than promised. I'm almost afraid to tell people for fear there won't be more when I need another one. We bought this to run on the Tracfone, bring your own phone service. And it works there too!"
"Apple",5,"Great phone! Works well and looks great! Thanks!"
"Apple",5,"The phone came in as a new one. I was looking for a CMDA phone and not a sims card. I guess I need to read a little better.Thanks Amazon."
"Apple",1,"Simply put, the phone didn't work. I brought it to Apple who said it wasn't new (as advertised) but rather it was an old phone made to look new. They looked up the details and said they had dealings with this seller before. Don't buy from Vantage Cellular."
"Apple",5,"fascinante, very nice"
"Apple",2,"Please do yourselves a favor and never purchase one of these phones......The phone seems to work fine at first but then about a week or two into using the phone my daughters phone started acting crazy this phone has not worked properly from the 2nd week we got it. I paid a good price for a phone that has not been usable in just about the whole year I had it. I am sure the person welling this phone is aware of this and just continues to take peoples money and send them crap phones.........I REPEAT DO NOT PURCHASE A PHONE FROM THIS SELLER!"
"Apple",5,"Came on time and works GREAT! No scratches or anything cosmetically. Great product and service"
"Apple",3,"the phone is fine but the screen has already cracked and don't know how to contact anyone to take advantage of 60day warranty-typical"
"Apple",5,"shoujihaibucuo,"
"Apple",4,"About JoyCells: I bought a 16 GB refurbed iPhone 4s from them a few weeks ago. It arrived quickly and the packaging was really smart, a plastic wrapper kept the phone strapped to the bottom of the box so the phone wasn't bouncing around during shipping. The order was fulfilled by Amazon so it had the Prime shipping, and I felt good knowing that I was backed with Amazons return policy should the phone be a dud. I have had no problem with the phone itself, it is in good working condition, clean, and undamaged though I can tell it is a used phone as it has some min or dings on the back glass panel. The phone came in an iPhone 4s box, with a charger, but no ear buds.About the 4s: I bought this phone because my Galaxy S4 had a tragic end and my contract wont give me a new phone for another 7 months. This phone was inexpensive so that's what won out. In general, I don't like the iPhone as much as I like my GS4. Don't quite know what else to say about it. The screen is VERY small for what I am used too, and that's my main complaint."
"Apple",5,"Wasnt sure what to expect when it said condition was acceptable. Very pleasantly surprised with a product that looks and performs like new! Worked out great, and would purchase again if the situation called for replacing the phone. Thanks!"
"Apple",3,"Seems to have a ringer volume problem."
"Apple",5,"Great... Perfect clean iPhone 4s"
"Apple",5,"Great , clean and perfect. Loving this iPhone 4s"
"Apple",1,"Came with a bad battery."
"Apple",5,"awesome device!"
"Apple",1,"I have contacted the seller multiple times regarding the phone being defective. The provided USB cable does not work, the speaker phone works intermittently, the screen has yellow tint around the top right corner, and the battery dies incredibly fast.This is a defective phone. I understand that mistakes happen, but the seller has not answered any of my questions, comments or emails n regards to replacing or refunding this device."
"Apple",1,"man i need to say you something about a telephone that i bought you, i was trying to unlocked my iphone 4 and when i tried they told me that the iphone 4 is stolen and i'm really disappointed with your services, you're a cheater!"
"Apple",5,"So great to buy a used phone with some confidence. This phone is even a step up from the one I had that was ruined by ocean water!!All is well."
"Apple",4,"I was pleased with the iPhone 4S. I will do business with the company when I upgrade."
"Apple",1,"Horrible. At first it was great it had nothing wrong with it. After just TWO weeks I am having to send it in for a new battery."
"Apple",5,"the phone was in perfect condition, but i found out I don't like iphone's. But it does work perfectly."
"Apple",5,"The product met my expectations. In addition, the product arrived on time. I have nothing to complain about.Satisfied Customer"
"Apple",5,"It's my first Apple product I have purchased and I am more than happy with it. The order arrived earlier than stated which of course was even better."
"Apple",5,"It works great I thought I was gonna get ripped off but I got what I wanted, no scratches perfectly good condition like new, I haven't activated it yet but I'm sure it'll go through."
"Apple",5,"Excellent phone. Use it heavily everyday and it works perfectly. Easy to use phone. I'm in love with this phone"
"Apple",1,"My son purchased this phone. we verified that it was not stolen.. however after it arrived and we went to Verizon to turn it on and it was reported stolen.. we received a full refund, but what a hassle"
"Apple",5,"This phone is badass dude. I just so happy with it. I can surf the web and manage my business."
"Apple",1,"This is an unlocked phone, but did not clearly described, I am very disappointed, because its description misled me. Causes me great distress"
"Apple",5,"Absolutely love my iPhone 4S!! I am so impressed with how accurate it was to the dealer's add, it is like brand new and I love Amazon's dependable service!"
"Apple",5,"My son shattered the screen on his iPhone 4, and we were able to purchase this 4S at a bargain price. It came in perfect condition, you would think it was brand new, and it continues to perform flawlessly. Amazon has done it again!"
"Apple",5,"Had to purchase a new phone, dropped mine in water, this phone worked just like my old one. In very good condition was really impressed!"
"Apple",4,"The IPhone I ordered has proven to be just as good as the other I had prior to this purchase. It does sometimes get a little glitchy when navigating, but it's nothing that impacts performance."
"Apple",5,"Phone works great and just as promised on the discription, the only problem was I paid extra for 2 day shipping and it actually took a week but other then the wait everything came as expected"
"Apple",1,"the owner did not think it was relevant to make it clear that the iphone he/she was selling was, in fact broken and the screen would not even turn on. I even took the phone to best buy and had them examine it and was told that it was beyond repair. Therefore, I paid $250.00 for an irriparable iphone. I contacted the seller to see if I could get my money back and was told that he/she did not provide refunds but offered to sell me a screen for the broken iphone that I purchased, (this would not have fixed the iphone and the owner was just trying to scam me further.) I am obviously not happy with my purchase and would advise anyone else against purchasing from this seller; he/she is a scam artist and fooled me."
"Apple",2,"Phone use is no problem, but the appearance of a deep scratches, and described as new businesses do not match, is in use, quite satisfactory."
"Apple",1,"Although the description doesn't say it's a new phone, it doesn't say it's a used one either, the one I got had all kinds of information from the previous owner. I don't have a problem buying a refurb, but I'd like to pay the price of one, not a slightly lower price than brand new one. So beware, you may be looking to buy a used phone."
"Apple",5,"Came in great condition and works great. Activation was very easy, and the serial was clean. Have been using it since purchase with no problems."
"Apple",5,"The package had not been handled at all, Everything was accounted for and still wrapped. I love my new phone."
"Apple",5,"Happybook1 is a trustworthy company .I have bought two iPhone 4S from happybook 1 and I have never had a problem with the phones . What ever Happybook1 sells it will work like it is brand new . Happybook 1 is a outstanding company ."
"Apple",5,"exactly as described in picture and very pleased with the quality of the phone works like it is brand new"
"Apple",5,"This iPhone was reconditioned. It appears new except for minor wear marks from a protective cover. These marks are hidden by the protective cover I put on it. After four weeks use I am satisfied that it functions like a new iPhone. It is my first smart phone and it replaces a desk full of addresses, numbers and lists I use to keep organized, and I am still learning new uses almost every day, (app's are wonderful). This iPhone, and probably all smart phones, are truly amazing."
"Apple",5,"Good quality. Great service. Shipped on time. Even included a case and screen protector for free. Would buy again. Thanks!"
"Apple",1,"The phone was in good condition. But it was not unlocked as advertised. I bought phone since it was unlocked and I could not use it."
"Apple",1,"I try to activate the iphone 4s in front of the Verizon wireless, but the service told me that the iphone 4s I just bought from Werehouse Deal is a stolen one!!!!"
"Apple",5,"working great."
"Apple",5,"Yes so far it has. Haven't had a chance to use it much"
"Apple",4,"Fast shipping, item as described"
"Apple",5,"perfecto"
"Apple",4,"The lower volume button is broken. Battery dies at 10%. It'll get me by though!"
"Apple",5,"Exactly as published! I utilize the speech option for texting and it functions flawlessly 80% of the time. I am comfortable with older technology for the savings aspect and hate the idea that we need to discard manufactured products on a habitual basis. I hope to get many many years service out of a phone."
"Apple",5,"Beautiful item."
"Apple",5,"good!"
"Apple",1,"The only reason I gave it 1 star is because technically I got a phone and it works. BUT. This was advertised as a ""NEW"" sealed phone. About 2 months after I got it the battery started draining really fast. I am familiar with best practices to extend battery life etc., so this indicated that the phone was not, in fact, new. At least the battery wasn't!Some time later I opened up the included earbuds and plugged them in, only to find out that they are really awful. The sound is bad, and it goes in and out. if you barely touch the cord, the sound glitches, indicating that internal wires may be loose. But they were ""NEW"", remember? Upon further examination, I'm pretty sure that they are knock-off buds, not true Apple buds.If I had purchased a phone that was honestly advertised as used/refurbished, I wouldn't have been as upset by these things. But to buy a ""new"" phone, only to be searching within months for a replacement battery, and spending additional money on a new pair of ear buds, is very frustrating. False advertising, to say the least. Feels like I was lied to."
"Apple",5,"Wonderful. This was a brand new phone seals in its original box."
"Apple",1,"About 2 weeks after receiving this phone it stopped working, wouldn't shut off, froze,wouldn't take pictures. I am extremely unhappy with this product. When I asked for a refund within the 30 day guarantee I never got a response."
"Apple",5,"Phone came as described, have faith that Amazon always provides quality products. Phone came with new ear buds and charging cables / brick. Phone was near flawless and made a 12 Yo a very happy camper on his birthday."
"Apple",5,"perfect!"
"Apple",5,"I got a great price on this iPhone which was in very good shape"
"Apple",1,"This product is broken! Iphone won't charge."
"Apple",3,"I bought this phone to replace a google galazy nexus. While this phone runs great most of the time, the phone will turn off with almost 30% left of battery life- sometimes more. I do really like this phone, but honestly, when you're in a time crunch and need something like directions or to get a hold of someone, having your phone turn off unexpectedly isn't awesome."
"Apple",1,"Clearly marked as a Verizon phone but it is not."
"Apple",1,"""I bought TWO of these phones which CLEARLY states Verizon. I received them and it is for VIRGIN mobile. Reading through the other reviews it looks like there are about 5 of us in recent days. Not only will I be returning it I'm letting Amazon know how wrong and misleading your advertising."
"Apple",4,"Meets all standards 👍"
"Apple",5,"great phone, great deal"
"Apple",1,"I got a broken one. The lock button did not work, and a week later, it couldn't take a charge."
"Apple",5,"This was a gift for my son and he LOVES it. He said he was surprised what great shape it was in. The shipping materials could have been better but the phone came through in just the padded envelope without a scratch."
"Apple",5,"This iPhone was exactly as depicted. At first I was skeptical buying an iPhone off Amazon but it worked and at a great price. When I went to charge the iPhone it didn't turn on so I contacted the seller and they agreed to take it back. Luckily I tried a different charging cable, the one they provided didn't work.the phone works great"
"Apple",5,"Fantastic phone. Perfect size,fits in pocket. Like the location of charging port. Easy to navigate,and don't need fingerprint to log on. Wish I phone 5 was built like this"
"Apple",5,"This phone came in great condition and everything was included in the package. I have not had any issues at all with the phone since. Great purchase."
"Apple",5,"Exactly what they promised, excellent condition. Came with the charger and was completely ready for activation. Recommend, especially at this price."
"Apple",1,"There wasn't anything in the description that I saw that said the power button was sticking so I had to spend another $65 dollars to get it fixed, had I known that before I bought it I wouldn't have bought it."
"Apple",1,"A month ago I bought them to you a cell phone, but I requested a new Iphone and you sent me a used Iphone. It seems to me that you are swindlers. I need you to solve the situation and send me back to my new phone."
"Apple",5,"The phone is in like-new condition and it was exactly as it was described! I am extremely happy with this purchase!"
"Apple",3,"Although this Verizon iPhone 4s is in great shape for a used one, I have not been able to use its international GSM capabilities abroad because has been blocked by Verizon with the complicity of Apple. The later does not unblock the iPhone without previous approval from Verizon; and Verizon does not unblock the international GSM capabilities of this units unless the owner (me or anyone) is a Verizon customer in good standing for at least two months. Sound like a monopoly? Seems unfair? Sure it is! I call Verizon Global Services and they told me that story and said that I should try that Amazon Warehouse (the seller) unblock it on my behalf. I tried to make it work with Kolbi 3.5G Costa Rican network, using its SIM card, buy the cellphone keep on asking Verizon unlocking code..."
"Apple",5,"Love it"
"Apple",1,"There is an issue with the wifi chip not working which is common with a lot of 4S's. Unfortunately, there is no way of fixing it so you'd going to end up with a phone that will only be able to use data."
"Apple",4,"Came in very little scrathes... Looks almost brand new...it did need the docking station cleaned out, other than that no problems great phone."
"Apple",4,"Terrific! The only drawback being that the battery loses charge very quickly. However, for the price it's a minor inconvenience."
"Apple",4,"Apple iPhone 4S 16GB (Black) - Verizon ...I Recieved my iPhone on time and It looked like it was brand new. The phone was still in the original box factory sealed, but the battery life sucks! It won't hardly hold a charge at all. Other then that it is exactly what I expected."
"Apple",1,"I thought I was getting a new phone. The condition stated new. I received the phone and the charger did not work. I called apple to warranty the charger. I was told that it wasn't new phone, and had been repaired a few times. I ended up buying a new charger elsewhere. I kept the phone because my other phone is completely dead. I really don't mind having a refurb but I'm upset that I paid for a new phone."
"Apple",5,"nice"
"Apple",1,"returned for battery failure"
"Apple",5,"excelled"
"Apple",1,"The Apple Iphone4s is shutting off continuously I'm not happy with this phone the battery percentage seems to be off"
"Apple",5,"Love this phone. Very easy to work with. would highly recommend. having the 16g allows more storage on phone for any downloads"
"Apple",4,"Shipped on time, in great condition. Note that with Verizon, you cannot change carriers after you activate it, so if you weren't planning on going with Verizon choose a different phone with the carrier you want to stick with. Otherwise great option if your looking into iPhones!"
"Apple",5,"Initially I had reservations about buying a refurbished iPhone, especially online, when you cant see your purchase beforehand.However, the price difference between a device from the Verizon store, about 200 dollars, is hard to deny. happybook1 put me at ease with her prompt email responses and patience handling my questions. I contacted her during the weekend, expecting hours or even days before a reply, but she emailed back within 20 minutes. When you buy from her store, you'll get almost an immediate email detailing your purchase and its tracking code, as well as an entreaty to take up any complaints or issues with her, which she will resolve to the best of her ability. I placed my order for an iPhone 4s- locked to Verizon on Saturday, and received it Wednesday, two days before the earliest delivery estimate, secured in a bubble wrapped envelope that was placed inside a tightly taped Priority cardboard box. The phone was in better condition than described, looking brand-new to all except the most discerning eye. It also came with new Apple earbuds, a USB connector, and front-and-back screen protectorsWhen buying an iPhone, or any other smartphone online, one runs the risk of getting a stolen item or encountering other ploys by unscrupulous sellers. I highly recommend happybook1 and am very satisfied with this transaction"
"Apple",5,"At first had a little trouble on activating but the guy was very helpful in his promot response and slove the problem. Love my new phone!!"
"Apple",5,"I got the 16g black iPhone 4S, and it is amazing. It arrived super fast, and in brand new condition. I was able to take it to Verizon and activate it no problem. They did a fantastic job, and I would recommend them to anyone."
"Apple",5,"I had lost mine and needed one ASAP and that is just what I received!! Great phone! Works Great! I would recommend it!"
"Apple",5,"Verizion was able to set it up as promised. It seems to be in primo condition and working well. Came in a timely manner."
"Apple",1,"think so its going back and i will not pay for it. i will send it to same address. now"
"Apple",5,"I got this phone on time. Everything works on the phone. I went to paid plus and have it signed up the next day. There was no problem at all. I will buy me an phone soon (I bought this one for my wife). Everything work fine and I am very glad that I brought this phone and I am looking on getting my phone from them. I read about people getting sucked by someone but I am very, very happy that I got my wife this phone."
"Apple",5,"my grand chiid lost his phone, this is a replacement. if he loses this one its on him and he will have to go to work."
"Apple",1,"Worked three days would not charge."
"Apple",5,"thanks, just what my son wanted. perfect. no complaints"
"Apple",2,"Product was not cleaned well. Phone speaker doesn't work well (cannot hear people when making phone calls"
"Apple",5,"Delivery was fast. Phone was as advertised. I would use this company again! Very happy!"
"Apple",1,"Phone did not work on delivery."
"Apple",5,"Works alright."
"Apple",3,"if i would of known that Apple uses almost half of the 16GB for loading their things, I would of not bought it"
"Apple",5,"Love it so much"
"Apple",5,"I have a 5S for work so I wanted to pick this one up for personal use. I was surprised how quickly it linked with my iPad. The seller had it at my door in 3 days!"
"Apple",2,"It's doing great. We appreciate the honesty and yalls word about the phone. We will be dealing with amazon more. Thanks again."
"Apple",5,"Love it. My samsung galaxy s4 started lagging really bad and I wasn't eligible for an upgrade for another year. I am not going to pay $600 for an iphone 5s. I bought an iphone 4s used in mint shape from erinbrooke for $120. This phone is faster and much easier to use than the s4. It basically streamlines everything. Dont think because this phone is 3 years old it isnt still up there with the galaxy s4. It is an excellent phone. I was easily able to transfer everything from my galaxy s4 to my iphone including my music andpictures. Buy one!"
"Apple",5,"Love the phone! In such good condition and so very few scratches. I think it is a good deal too. The man who helped me was very polite and nice also."
"Apple",5,"I bought this as a replacement iPhone, passing one to my daughter. It's different to the iPhone 5, but was in great condition and has worked flawlessly since.I'll be interested to see how it looks one iOS 8 is installed."
"Apple",5,"I am very satisfied with the phone and it was a great price."
"Apple",1,"I order unlocked and he com verizon now what i dont nead"
"Apple",5,"Phone was what I expected. It came with ios 6.1.3 and battery life was kind of short. After updating to 7.1.2 battery life has improved by at least 50%."
"Apple",2,"Phone is fine. Charger burned out and killed my battery. still waiting for return label.been over a week."
"Apple",5,"100% recommended."
"Apple",1,"good, buy iphone 4s which line the place you do not take'm from Venezuela, the same as when you bought it told me that it was released for all the online right now as I have my iphone paperweight ..... I hope your reply as soon as possible."
"Apple",5,"Very happy with this purchase. Works with all my iPod equipments, plugs and chargers. The 5s as I understand it has different plugs so this was better for me."
"Apple",5,"First I will begin by saying I purchased this phone through Diamond Wireless, for the reason being that all the reviews are mixed up from different sellers, it was difficult to choose a reliable seller, I love this phone, it is with me 90% of the time, no problems at all! It is what was advertised, delivery was quick! It was indeed new as it was described. No problems connecting to my service provider, if you purchase through Diamond Wireless you get a 90 day store guarantee. I'm watching for the iphone 5C and will purchase from Diamond Wireless again. This phone is easy to use, I've texted, talked, played games, the screen is great! You can still see your screen when your outside! Love it! Don't have one negative thing to say. Highly recommend! I don't regret purchasing this for one minute. Is it crazy to say that I have an attachment to this phone. (: Never loved a phone so much! If you purchase through Diamond Wireless you won't be sorry. I'll say it again, highly recommend!"
"Apple",4,"Very nice"
"Apple",5,"Speedy shipping and product as described!"
"Apple",3,"The cellphone is OK, but it's locked by Verizon, i can't use it in China"
"Apple",1,"Did now work"
"Apple",1,"This was under the unlocked phone category and when I received it the phone was locked and virtually worthless for my trip to Europe. Very unhappy."
"Apple",5,"The phone was great and nice my daughter was happy..I was thinking to order another set..specially arrived on time, but much better if more earlier."
"Apple",5,"Activated using straight talk website on Verizon's network. Unlimited talk, text, and web for $55 /month."
"Apple",5,"Works great! My daughter was thrilled"
"Apple",1,"First of all a cordial greeting I write to notify my troublesome one and dissatisfaction since the telephone that and bought to one of his sellers an iPhone 4s white color of 16g after my patient wait to come defective and without other one is able to acquire already the Venezuelan alone government grants 300 annual dollars not as doing or that it does in this case please it helps"
"Apple",4,"Its a great product but is a little on the fragile side given the amount of class in the phone."
"Apple",5,"Wonderful phone. One of the best phones I have ever had. I would recommend this to all of my friends and family."
"Apple",5,"prefect!amazing iphone .I love it,It is an amazing phone,great function and more details. The person is still very nice.All in all.nice job."
"Apple",3,"The iPhone 4s is pretty awesome, but it helps if the product wasn't reported lost or stolen when calling to activate it to my phone number."
"Apple",5,"Just love it, wonder what took me so long. Had to buy a book about ""how to"" and will learn Siri soon. Great product"
"Apple",5,"Thank you so much. Fast and works perfect. If I didn't fid that I don't think I would have gotten another iPhone"
"Apple",3,"I owned a smartphone prior to the iPhone. It was way more user friendly. The apps were more user friendly and all my music downloads and ring tones were free. The only thing I like better on my iPhone is the camera however I think the process to upload my photos is more difficult on the iPhone. I had thought face time would be nice but found out I could use an app with my smart phone that is free for face time."
"Apple",4,"I purchased this item as a xmas gift. I must say the item arrived way begore schedule. I checked out the authenticity and all was good. Im very happy."
"Apple",3,"I buy it unlock the phone to find it, but when it is not received Unlocked, I need to pay an additional $ 56 to unlock it.Although it looks very good."
"Apple",5,"Thanks so much for a smooth purchase and A+ service. Will be giving this phone to my sister for christmas and am very stoked to have gotten such a great product at such a reasonable price. Cheers!"
"Apple",1,"Not a Verizon phone! Looks good but I can not use because it's not a Verizon phone. Very disappointed"
"Apple",1,"As it says, Verizon 4s ... I just went to verizon wireless to get my number transferred over, turns out I cant because it says in the general info that it is a sprint phone. So much for my excitement when I saw the package on my door step..."
"Apple",5,"wife loves it ... thanks"
"Apple",1,"This is a brocken refurbished product..is dead..i want my money back"
"Apple",1,"Well, I ordered an iPhone 4s, but I got a plain iPhone 4. They look similar but, now I can't update to IOS 9 (stuck with IOS 7). I double checked and sure enough, I ordered a 4s, the delivery box said 4s, but the reseller packaged iPhone 4!"
"Apple",3,"My microphone had water damage"
"Apple",5,"Good"
"Apple",5,"Still works great."
"Apple",1,"Wasn't unlock had to ship it to the states to get apple to unlock it"
"Apple",5,"Works great!"
"Apple",1,"I ordered it. It said Verizon phone unlocked but it would not work"
"Apple",3,"The phone I received is in great shape, but it is a GSM phone and will not work on Verizon. I am hoping this review will lead Amazon to change the product description."
"Apple",5,"great price, great phone, looks good and works perfectly,thanks."
"Apple",5,"Exactly as described!"
"Apple",1,"Broke down and had battery problems...WOULD NOT RECCOMEND THIS VENDOR"
"Apple",4,"Good condition, works well, except for home button which has to be pressed more firm, but is really great overall!"
"Apple",5,"Item returned but as described"
"Apple",5,"Nice"
"Apple",5,"great buy, great product"
"Apple",5,"Perfect condition. Just as described by the seller. Works great at a fair price."
"Apple",1,"Bad from the start! Arrived late, and when it did it literally was crusted with some unknown substance. There were also scratches and strange brown spots at the edge of the case. Not as advertised. I emailed them about it and they basically called me a liar. I sold the phone to a person in my office at a $50 dollar loss just not have to deal with this company again. He is cleaning the scum off it as I write this. Disgusting."
"Apple",2,"wifi is bad,wifi grayed out, I can not use this feature phone,I was very disappointed with the 4s.How can I do it"
"Apple",1,"Purchased this phone on July 19th, 2013. It was listed as in ""new"" condition. The phone occasionally failed to switch on, but I was able to get it to activate by holding down both buttons for 15 seconds or so. Finally on or about January 25th, 2014 it failed to switch on and I could not get it to activate. Took it to Verizon ( where I had previously taken it when it would not activate) and they too could not get it to open. I was advised by you that the phone was out of warranty. Took it to the Apples Store ( a 180 mile round trip from my home) where they quickly brought it back by removing the battery and then replacing the same battery. ( basically re-booting)The Apple technician was able to tell me that the phone was originally purchased from Apple in mid 2012 at a store in Las Vegas and that it showed signs of having been ""refurbished.""Given that supposition I would find it very hard to rate this provider other than one star. I am very disappointed."
"Apple",1,"Phone was broken, home button did not work, volume and speaker didn't work. The phone was randomly freeze. It was con"
"Apple",5,"The giftee LOVE's this phone more than her friends 5S. She had no problem getting this phone activated with Verizon once she took it to a corporate store. Activation could not be done online and the one Verizon reseller she went to wouldn't touch it."
"Apple",1,"When i received the phone I found that the top button did not click and now i have to use the accessibility feature to turn it off. Also the battery life, even when all apps are closed and screen is shut off, is horrible."
"Apple",5,"Ordered from Mango Wireless in like new condition. Phones came as described. New and in original boxes. Only issue was they put a T-mobile SIM card in one of the phones i ordered which are Verizon. Simple fix just had to remove the card. Contacted the seller but still no response. However I am very pleased with my order and haven't had any other problems since."
"Apple",5,"Great phone....exactly what I was looking for. Seller was spot on on what phone offered. More of a beginner iPhone but as an experienced user I like the simple ness."
"Apple",5,"The 4S is a great phone, I never realized how great until it was trade in time and I got a 'Droid phone. Sure my iPhone is only 3G, but I don't use the hotspot feature that much to really care, as an internet client browser it is excellent. In terms of functionality, well all of it's apps work, I can't say the same thing for my Android phone,Sure I have a Mac Mini at home and everything integrates well, which is how it should all work. I actually do some Mac programming and I'm a long time Unix lover so the mac is perfect for me, my phone, which runs the latest and greatest OS does so and will continue to because Apple doesn't fragment their iOS distro unlike other companies. There is basically one platform which makes life simple for developers...enough of this stuffThe bottom line is that it works, from Siri to browsing, texting and integrating with my desktop. When it finally dies, I'll get a new iPhone, Foxcomm might suck as a company, but they make some great products,."
"Apple",5,"Looked brand new even though it's used! Works great! I love the design and the iPhone is the best phone"
"Apple",4,"I needed a replacement phone as I ruined my iPhone 5 last October. The phone arrived in a timely fashion, great appearance, but better yet it has been working flawlessly. Plan to get one for my husband."
"Apple",5,"I was skeptical about buying a phone online. But I did a lot of research and was careful to pick a reputable seller. I also checked that the IMEI had been cleared and that the phone was set up for my carrier. I received the phone promptly and had no problem setting up the service. The phone is just like brand new, but I paid about half the price...love it!"
"Apple",5,"Highly recommended from here! Came good as new and no problems. Works perfectly fine and I couldn't enjoy it anymore than I do."
"Apple",5,"They did such an incredible time. The phone got here before it was scheduled and is in tip top shape. Runs perfect and they are very efficient.Highly recommended!"
"Apple",4,"Going from an android to and iPhone there's much of a difference. I like the iPhone more, the only reason I am not giving it 5 stars is because the screen cracks quickly. I've had the phone for 2 months and my screen is already cracked."
"Apple",1,"We'll the company that shipped the phone either messed up with fedex or FedEx messed up either way I didn't get the phone when I was supposed to but that isn't what bothered me per se, what bothered me is when I was activating the supposed new phone I found out through verizon that the phone had two previous owners...I contacted the company that is the go between with amazon and they blew me off. In the end they just beat me through attrition."
"Apple",1,"You bought a phone that was supposed to be new and was refurbished, you send it me on a napkin whitout charger or accesories and when i return it rather than returning me 300 dollars that i pay for it, you only give me 200 dollar, abusive. Get unable to retur 80 percent at least."
"Apple",1,"I got the phone from a reputable seller. The phone was shipped within a couple hours of purchase. It arrived to my office within 72 hours. The phone looked like 8/10 with the described surface damage. It looked great. However, on the first attempt at an incoming call, it is sent directly to voicemail and it never rings on my end. Only when the outside caller attempts to redial does the phone ring. So the result was a ton of missed calls for my business, which I cannot afford."
"Apple",4,"With the holidays and such the item was slow in getting to me. But once it came it lived up to my expectations."
"Apple",1,"Not only was this not an iphone 4s (it was an iphone 4), when we decided to keep it anyway and activate it, Verizon refused to activate it as it was listed as a lost or stolen phone. This was a Christmas gift and pretty much ruined Christmas for us. We returned it and received a refund. I used amazon instead of buying locally to avoid this type of situation. I was told I would be given an amazon credit for all of my trouble and have yet to see that."
"Apple",2,"OK"
"Apple",3,"just so so！What I bought is an used like new iphone 4s on the warehouse deals. The condition of the item is just so so, not very good or bad. But I used it well. It has not any problems."
"Apple",5,"A+"
"Apple",1,"Cannot hear caller so must use speaker or earbuds. Now callers can't hear me."
"Apple",5,"Nice"
"Apple",5,"Great item! Thank you so much!"
"Apple",5,"Liked the phone."
"Apple",5,"Came just as listed, no scratches and in perfect condition. Honestly the best you can ask for at such a low price."
"Apple",1,"The phone is received was more than excessively scratched up, it took Verizon 2 hours to activate it, and it's overheating as we speak in my hand. I've literally had it activated for all of 5 hours fully charged it and it's battery is already dead. The description is nothing like what I received this morning. I'm beyond pissed."
"Apple",1,"These phone keeps on turning it self off and the battery life last on like 3 hours or less. So if there is any one who knows what up let me know it a it's a hassle to return it."
"Apple",3,"Wifi didn't work on this phone. It wasn't from a lack of trying. I liked other features of this phone and that's why I gave it a 3."
"Apple",1,"I will never shop at amazon again to this date I still cannot use the phone I purchased because there was no user name and pass word to unlocked the device and to make things worst the website that was provided to unlocked the phone was not able to do so"
"Apple",5,"Nice phone for a good price. If you need a new phone, and it's not time for an upgrade under your contract, this is the way to go."
"Apple",4,"As expected I rode in a white horse drawn chariot, along side me was Elppa. The road littered with decomposing"
"Apple",4,"it is good. no problems so far, it isnt slow and i got it set up nice and easily. good stuff"
"Apple",4,"I found this phone to be a good purchase. It arrived on time and as it was described. I have yet to find any fault with it."
"Apple",5,"I was very unsure about purchasing this phone at first, especially due to some of the reviews... But them being old reviews, I just took the risk and purchased it anyways! I received it today and so far everything seems to be working just fine. Already comes with ios7 installed and original charger and cable come with it as well. Phone is used, it has normal wear on the silver edges, but nothing to the point of complaining. I also got it activated without a problem :)"
"Apple",5,"I have enough to buy a 4S product performance is perfect, the Internet phone messages are very good. Very grateful to the U.S. Amazon warehouse to give me such a perfect product."
"Apple",4,"Everything is good and as expected. Nothing wrong with the phone just switched it recently and having a blast downloading new apps with new and improved phone and software that comes with it."
"Apple",5,"He loves it. Still trying to get used to all the features. This phone replaced a very old flip phone from years ago."
"Apple",5,"Very good condition..also had ear piece charger which was a plus. Very pleased"
"Apple",5,"very good"
"Apple",4,"Everything works, but the battery is basically shot. Would have liked to know this in the description."
"Apple",5,"Everything went great"
"Apple",5,"Was in excellent condition and worked as advertised."
"Apple",1,"The first phone I received was a turned in gov't. phone with a bad battery, the second phone was an a.t.t. phone. I sent them both back and went back to my ravine flip phone that always works. So much for upgrades!"
"Apple",1,"The phone required a $75 repair less than a week after I received it."
"Apple",5,"love it..."
"Apple",1,"Ugh! Had terrible issues with mail delivery delays and then when it arrived, it had not been reset and was unusable. How can that even happen?"
"Apple",5,"Very happy! Quick delivery and everything perfect! Thanks"
"Apple",5,"Great experience from beginning to end. Someone stole my first I-phone and I ordered from another company at first and did not get what I wanted. I was a little hesitant at first, but, it turned out to be the best decision. Great customer service,affordable price, I was able to use my AMEX points as well, timely delivery and new out of the box condition phone! What a peace of mind!"
"Apple",5,"I bought this phone for my daughter's 15th birthday. She loves it! It arrived in pristine condition, we easily activated it at our local Verizon store, and it has been working perfectly ever since. The seller provided great follow up to our order. I would absolutely purchase from this seller again. :)"
"Apple",1,"This is a defective phone advertised under the precept of it being used - VERY good condition. Advertised as slight water damage causing screen to have minor discoloration on top and bottom, no crack screen ..which we discovered meant in reality that it was severely water damaged, the camera didn't work (very good condition ..not), it had a replacement screen that was not properly connected to give complete visibility (no crack screen ..of course not it was replaced), the screen continuously jumped up and down and evenly went black (which i'm not sure if that is better or worse than the minor discoloration on top and bottom of screen) all within 3 hours of activating the phone. This phone was in anything but good condition, and dishonest semantics justified dishonest behavior and that is bad business dealing for such (what I thought was) a trustworthy site as Amazon."
"Apple",5,"Phone came in a box with accessories and works great!!!! I was pleasantly surprised. Was just like new. Would recommend"
"Apple",5,"The truth is, they are both fabulous pieces of equipment that we are all very lucky to have in our lives. I actually remember having a 4 digit phone number and 5 people sharing the same line!! But, for reasons subtle which I am not even totally conscious of, I love my iPhone and I didn't love my Android."
"Apple",1,"I recently bought an iPhone 4S from this seller. When it arrived it looked fine. We went to Verizon to set it up- and here is where the problem started. The camera light would not turn off, the tech said that's a sign of water damage and it was literally draining the battery at very rapid rate. I booked a Genius Bar appointment at apple to see if it could be fixed. When they opened up the phone they discovered it has been tampered with, voiding the warranty and the light was not repairable.Contacted the seller who sent us another iPhone 4S. POTENTIAL BUYERS READ THIS: given our issue with the last phone we booked another apple store appointment just to have the phone checked out. It's even worse this time around, the apple tech said it had been tampered with and cautioned us to get rid of the phone as soon as possible. When I pushed him for details on what was wrong with the phone, He said the phone had been tampered with to the point that it can be used for IDENTITY THEFT, basically opening any accounts used on the phone and getting account information- he wasn't supposed to tell us this but thank god he did! Almost everyone I know has a banking app or email with very private information.No matter how much it ends up costing you, do not buy from this seller. I'm fairly certain all of the positive reviews are from people who are none the wiser and never had their phones inspected by an apple tech. Remember that it takes over a year to get your identity back if its stolen, not worth it for a used iPhone."
"Apple",2,"the product was not required because I'm blocked with the telephony company verizon, I try to unlock it but it is very expensive and keep him. now the battery does not work and not to do, I lost my money, please tell me that I can do, if I can still return it. thanks"
"Apple",5,"this phone was great my son was the one to purchase this phone , I would recommend to friends and family!"
"Apple",5,"It's an amazing product and was brand new. No scratches or anything and I was overall happy with it. It also came fast in the mail"
"Apple",5,"1st phone would completely discharge after 2.5 hrs. Automatically mute itself so you couldn't hear it ring. Voice quality was fuzzy. Seller was not easy to deal with and after shipping the phone back to him, he denied there was anything wrong with it and was going to charge a 6% restocking fee!! After finally convincing him of the issues, he did send a working, quality phone."
"Apple",5,"I had a droid phone and had lots of problems. Verizon swapped it out 3 times and the problems never ceased. Got this phone and love it. No problems, no glitches and have signal. Love it!!"
"Apple",4,"Apple makes a great phone there is no doubt. I bought this for my daughter. It works flawlessly and smoothly. The big problem with Apple products are they are proprietary locked down. Even a charger costs $20.00, and the number of free apps is much smaller than android products."
"Apple",5,"I especially like the speech to print feature. This is a great phone, no complaints, and it arrived much earlier than expected."
"Apple",5,"Love the product. Easy to use. Fits in back pocket. Love the features and speed. Would recommend to everyone. Very satisfied."
"Apple",1,"When I tried to activate the phone, I was told the phone had been reported lost or stolen, so obviously could not be used. The only positive thing I can say is that the seller did refund the purchase with minimal hassle."
"Apple",4,"The battery can be used only half an day when listen music or watch movie or play games. If in the standy model, it can be used for one day."
"Apple",5,"Arrived in excellent condition!! Functions flawlessly and worked right out of the box for my mother's Christmas gift. Worth it"
"Apple",2,"Had a 5, lost it and replaced with a 4. Poor choice though cheaper. Calendar always out of sync for time zone, not user friendly."
"Apple",5,"This seller was great even sent me an upgrade phone from what was in the desciption. Didn't arrive on the date it was suppose to but he refunded me some of my money back. i would definitly recomend this seller to anyone. They were very understanding and would take care of any issues you have. I would defenitly go back to this seller for any of my wireless needs. Also this seller is very good about contacting you if needed. Very Happy with the phone everything works and looks like its brand new. I would actually rate this seller on scale 1-10 i would rate them a Big 8 because evrything almost went as planed thanks so much for everthing. Kevin"
"Apple",4,"The speaker for the phone didn't work at first, but after a cleaning it worked like new. Pretty happy with the purchase."
"Apple",1,"I bought an Iphone 4s and can not talk on it because the mic does not work!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!This is the way the phone came."
"Apple",1,"my wifi for the phone is not turning on anymore, you gave me a useless phone and now I have to get a new phone"
"Apple",5,"the purchase and product was a very good choice. everything went very well, purchase, shipping, and product is what you would want"
"Apple",5,"This phone was in great condition as advertised"
"Apple",1,"The bottom line is that I disliked this phone so much that I returned it! I know you're not supposed to say that about Apple products, but read on to see why I think people are largely ""drinking the Koolaid"" on the iPhone.The Bad: When I first wanted a smartphone I got a very cheap Droid, which was hard to sync between the Mac home computer I use and my Google email accounts. Eventually I got it working, but I anticipated that the almighty iPhone would be seamless right out of the box. It wasn't -- with the iPhone I had all the same troubles going back to the Google accounts that I had had with the Droid going to the Apple products the first time around. Not fun.I also didn't like that there is NO app available to back SMS text messages up to your Gmail or other email account the way there is for Android phones (SMS Backup+). In the event of a phone change, and god forbid you do not want another iProduct, you will lose all of those conversations.I couldn't organize the screens the way I wanted them.I missed having my contacts' pictures show up next to text messages and in my phone address book. (It's the little things, but still!)The ""back"" menus will probably frustrate former Droid users, as sometimes you have to use the actual butto at the bottom of the phone to go back to the Home screen, but sometimes you want the real ""back"" button on the screen which is usually (but not always) located at the top. This is counterintuitive and annoying.The Good: The camera worked well, the screen was beautiful and the sound was good. Size is great compared to the other expensive Android models which are a bit like holding an entire computer up to your head. Also, there are no rights issues with older iTunes purchases which I have yet to resolve on my new Android.The Verdict: Overall I was disappointed in the operating system I think largely because the iPhone is supposed to be the gold standard among smartphones and I had heard wonderful, glowing things from so many people who LOOOOVE their iPhones. However, naysayers come out of the woodwork once they realize that they will have a sympathetic ear in someone who isn't subscribing blindly to the iUniverse, and there are a fair number of people who prefer the Droids. To me the final factor may be how computer-savvy you are going in, and how much time you want to put into learning about your phone and all the different service providers and programs that will, in theory at least, work together to get it to do what you want it to do. If you're willing to take the time, you might eventually prefer an Android. If not, the iPhone is definitely not as simple as I thought it would be but I would still recommend it for anyone who doesn't have the technological know-how or desire to play detective in order to get things set up.I will add that when combined with trying to find the right cellular service provider (Verizon has NONEXISTANT customer service and everything requires several phone calls as well as hours on hold to get anything done, AT&T has less signal strength in my area and I couldn't get usable data to with T-Mobile through Straight Talk), buying a new phone and a smartphone in particular has been one of THE most frustrating experiences of my life. Once I get my current phone working (a Samsung Galaxy S3), I plan to keep it forever and to never, ever, ever make any changes to my ""system"" again! What an exercise in futility this has been!"
"Apple",1,"Apple is very proprietary. If you can deal with the mass limitations, even between other Apple products, it's a decent smartphone. It is hugely over priced though."
"Apple",5,"Highly recommend. Ordered this iPhone and it ended up coming right during an address change, and he was really easy to work with about the shipping. IPhone arrived in great condition and works great. I will definitely be recommending Alex to future buyers and will use him anytime i'm caught between upgrades needing a phone. Thanks for all the hard word"
"Apple",3,"When I received the iphone there was a crack on the back of the phone across the camera eye. It was mentioned in the description before I purchased the phone, it had no scratches or cracks. That statement is misleading. I would not use the vendor again. Thank you, pw"
"Apple",4,"Very helpful when I had the issue and then phone started working on its own. When I originally contacted them I was not happy with the response but as soon as I wrote the review they were more than happy to help me with my issue and it was corrected quickly."
"Apple",5,"The phone is in like new condition. Has a small scratch on the screen that's barely noticeable, but other than that the phone has been very good to me."
"Apple",5,"You can get one a lot cheaper but it came in really great condition just one speck on the screen with the led but I love it !!"
"Apple",3,"Its a pretty nice phone, but in my case I couldn't stand it. I bought this iPhone to be a 'backup' if you will. I have the Galaxy S 3, and switching to the iPhone (which isn't even 4G) is a major downgrade."
"Apple",3,"Phone use is no problem. Condition said ""like new"", but I'm not satisfied with it. I hope it is real ""like new""."
"Apple",1,"I sent a msg to the place that i purchased the iphone saying that the phone is an iphone 4 and not an iphone 4s as i puchased for, i didnt get any answer from it. I am really upset about it. i want my money of the difference back!!! I am from Argentina and i cant exchange the phone but i want the money of the difference in my credit card back."
"Apple",5,"perfect screen and back cover , some lightly scratch on metal frame,the net is locked by verizon, I must spend about 80 $ to unlock it,"
"Apple",3,"I liked the iphone but after one month I found that its one speaker is not working. I was thinking that everything would be fine because when I was shopping on Amazon there was written that we have tested this item and every thing is working fine. There was a scratch on the body also."
"Apple",5,"The phone is easy to use, and the Iphone can't be hard to handle. You need to add your own contacts and setup the verizon information when you activate the phone itself. Verizon, was helpful to help setup the phone, and walks you through the steps to get the iphone going.This Iphone is a big upgrade from Iphone 4 and the next one to get if you want is iphone 5c , but if you want to use your finger print then get iphone 5s instead.The Iphone 4s has many neat features from the boarding pass, the compass, a good handy world clock, and a compass to track your journey's and use itunes and other neat stuff.Be sure to get a verizon based phone, its well worth it."
"Apple",5,"I am in love with this Iphone, I cannot get enough of it. I already got it connected :)! loveeee"
"Apple",1,"The iphone cycled upon purchase, so I upgraded to the latest iOS. After that, the Wifi was grayed out so we couldn't actually turn it on or off. Turns out, tons of people have this problem. Returned it."
"Apple",5,"I bought it for my son. He and i were both impressed with the condition and quality of this item, very satisfied. two thumbs up"
"Apple",5,"Second IPhone I've ordered from Planet Mobile. Both were gifts for others and they both loved their phones. No issues activating. Shipped and received pretty quickly, less than 5 business days in each case."
"Apple",5,"I bought this iPhone 4S from the Amazon Warehouse because of the great return policy. I wasn't sure what I would receive. The condition was described as Used - Like New which was a little too positive. Front and back sides were flawless, the metallic ring (antenna) had dirt and residue which I could not remove so far. The battery seems to be the original one which already shows signs of wear. Might need to replace with a new one soon.First thing I checked if the ESN/IMEI was clean which it was. It could even be activated with Tracfone in the BYOP program.Overall I am happy with the purchase although some other buyers reported that Amazon Warehouse Used - Like New meant really new. But that would not have worked with Tracfone since they require a previously Verizon-activated device in order to activate with their bring your own phone program (modified from their Page Plus acquisition)."
"Apple",1,"Phone is not unlocked as sold. Unfortunately as I left for the UK shortly after buying it, I have misssed my return window. Next time I'll set fire to $200 instead. BUYER BEWARE."
"Apple",5,"Phone came in excellent condition. Shipping was quicker than posted. I got this phone for my son who broke his old one.....as of now he seems pleased with his replacement. Also came with the usb cable."
"Apple",1,"Phone looked great when it arrived, but when we went to activate it at the Verizon store, they said it couldn't connect to anything cellular. Completely defective, need to return now."
"Apple",4,"The VERY best. Thanks Steve Wozniak for what YOU began and YOUR creative genius - Apple. Steve Jobs was a marketing genius so do not credit him with the genius behind Apple engineering. This is a FABULOUS phone! Thanks for ALL of the H-A-R-D work 1000 employees of ""Project Purple."""
"Apple",1,"phone defective volume button does not work at all."
"Apple",5,"Device met my expectations and very great experience dealing with seller thank u"
"Apple",5,"Fabulous. So glad I updated my daughter's old flip phone to the 4S."
"Apple",5,"Great quality, and got here just in time to be my sister's Christmas present :)"
"Apple",1,"I am here to buy second-hand mobile phones, obviously open, repair, cell phone charge can only use continuously for an hour, most efficiency is 35, the inner problem still don't know how many goods, praise is so much, at the time said looks very new, bought, the screen is definitely not original factory and the screen has a small hole in the middle"
"Apple",2,"Does not stay charged, shuts down unexpectedly at inopportune times."
"Apple",2,"Bought 2 as new, however, 1 battery barely holds a charge leading me to believe it may have been refurbished or used."
"Apple",1,"Battery was shot"
"Apple",5,"muy bien"
"Apple",3,"The front facing camera was broken."
"Apple",4,"good product for the money"
"Apple",1,"this phone was sold by Diamond wireless as new but was defective. it wont connect to any wi-fi and the screen cracked while i was holding it in my hand. Furthermore when I was told to return it for a replacement ( $22.00 ) I'm being told they cant replace it because it is locked into an I cloud account witch was never done by me. I will definitely think twice about buying electronics online again. $234.88 plus $22. down the drain and I still have to go buy a phone. I've been robbed !!!"
"Apple",1,"I sold something bad did not come as the public did not come here in Venezuela released as he had written on their website so I really do not recommend it for anything other team was saying came back and used"
"Apple",5,"Does everything I want it to do."
"Apple",2,"Had to return it. Now no phone."
"Apple",1,"The mobile phone bought by me can not work in China no matter what method used. My friend is afraid of this phone is not a new one, but I bought it because it is a new one."
"Apple",5,"Perfect condition. Came in a different phone box, but that didn't matter to me. Was able to bring to Verizon, and get info transferred without a hitch. And was able to skip the added on monthly fees if I would have bought the same phone from Verizon saving us hundreds of dollars each year for the next two years."
"Apple",2,"I'm glad I got it at a cheap price and its a working phone, but, both sides of my camera does it focus and it's really hard for me knowing that I take photos for a living and would like to use my phone once in a while."
"Apple",2,"I was disappointed with the size of the damage on the top of the screen. A large part of the screen is missing. It had said there was a crack, but it's more like a chunck of the screen fell out."
"Apple",4,"I thought it would have come with a sim card"
"Apple",4,"Had a few problems with OS and had to replace battery after 2 years of use."
"Apple",5,"I received the Apple iPhone on time and the phone arrived as it was described. There were no visible scratches or anything. Dan was very helpful when it came to answering questions about the phone. Thanks!"
"Apple",5,"Product came as described, in excellent condition. Standard shipping was very fast. Ordered on the 12th and got the 15th. Got email same day I ordered saying it already shipped. Set up with Verizon already, and working great! Came set back to factor settings ready to go. Very pleased."
"Apple",4,"I received it right"
"Apple",4,"the item seems great thanks."
"Apple",1,"This phone would not completely charge....ever! If it was as much as 50% charged and I used it to take a picture or send a message, the charge would drop to zero. I returned it and the seller gave me a full refund. Just a lemon, I guess!"
"Apple",2,"Okay but the battery does not stay charged very long"
"Apple",5,"Excelente."
"Apple",5,"The phone works great I was scared at first for buying a phone on the internet but its great even when I thought it was the wrong phone and I messed up the were very polite and fast about my concern/ return request."
"Apple",5,"Great service. Good phone and we received it right away. Very satisfied."
"Apple",5,"What a great phone, would buy it again, very smart app's."
"Apple",5,"GREAT!!"
"Apple",5,"Is great phone love it"
"Apple",4,"I like it."
"Apple",5,"Great deal great phone"
"Apple",5,"Great Phone! My iPhone 5 started dropping calls / not receiving calls / everything going to voicemail before my 2 years were up and Verizon couldn't do anything about it. So this is my replacement and I love it. Little slower than the 5 but better size and works."
"Apple",4,"I love this phone easy to use,don't like the Calendar layout as much as on my IPhone 3 but found another Planner app that works fine.The only downside is that the battery needs to be charged everyday,I was told by others later that this is a problem with this phone"
"Apple",4,"Performs as advertised"
"Apple",5,"I was pleasantly surprised my 13yr old lost his cell. Verizon wasn't able to provide another 4s at the time. I searched around and found a new phone never used before here on Amazon. It worked out very well, I was able to activate with Verizon no problems at all. I kept waiting for something to go wrong or fail with the phone but it didn't."
"Apple",5,"Everything is awesome"
"Apple",5,"Perfect condition. Thank You"
"Apple",1,"I was sold a device that stopped working after just a few days. The device began to randomly turn off. I took it to the Verizon store and they managed to reset it. Their diagnostic found nothing wrong with it. Then it happened again a few days ago. I took it to the Apple store and they said ""defective hardware"". Apple warranty replaced it for $199.00. Now I am out double the money because this vendor re-sold someone else's defective device."
"Apple",2,"This phone needs a lot more work than I anticipated."
"Apple",5,"Great!"
"Apple",1,"it have many problem about it ( the speaker have broken)"
"Apple",4,"4 plus year old model works as expected. Good solid feel. Replacing same era Windows phone that no longer plays all CNN and YouTube videos. There are also 10 apps on iPhone I use that are not available for Windows phone.Office ,Onenote, and Onedrive are all available on iPhone."
"Apple",5,"I was worries after the reviews but it came brand new. Perfect"
"Apple",5,"After grandson's 5C phone got left in his baseball pants and went through the wash, we got him the 4S phone. The phone arrived in 2 days and he is very happy with it."
"Apple",5,"GREAT!!!!!!!!"
"Apple",1,"This phone was not originally Verizon aand for the money that was paid I can't get on the internet unless I am somewhere where someone has WiFi. Very disappointing ."
"Apple",3,"the phone came with one screw missing and the other loose on the plugin for charging. the battery goes dead overnight if not plugged into a charger."
"Apple",1,"At first glance, the phone looked fine, however the photo's I took using my phone looks ""foggy"". Upon closer inspection, there are gouges/crapes right on the exterior of the camera lens. Also, while this is a 3G phone, it has difficulty connecting. My partner has the exact same phone and when in the house or riding down the highway, his will be on 3G while mine is on 1x... whatever that is. Doing simple processes is delayed as if the processor or RAM is having some problem"
"Apple",2,"You can't hear from ear piece and the call screen disappears and every once in a while letters and numbers flicker while in a call phone had issues when shipped"
"Apple",2,"Worked fine for 2 weeks and then the speaker went out"
"Apple",1,"Save your money, they claimed the phone was but it's not. I've had the phone 2 months and now have to pay $120 for a new battery and new screen."
"Apple",1,"Product was defective, not charging properly. Battery drains immediately even while on standby. Something that shouldn't have been sold to us. People just like to sell you anything even if they are aware of it being defective."
"Apple",1,"It didn't work and I had to pay to ship it back"
"Apple",1,"Within 2 weeks the charger stopped working....Seems like it has a bad battery or something....cuts off at 40%....you can charge for hours will not fully charge...not what I expected...."

"Apple",5,"Originally, I was unsure about this phone as the reviews aren't great. However, my phone came in great condition and so far am not having problems with it."
"Apple",1,"Problem of battery or phone ??? Obligate to charge it 4 or 5 time a day and the battery indicate 80% one minute later it 30% and when you plug it one second indicate charge 60%"
"Apple",1,"The phone only works with a US SIM card. So it is not unlocked for non US SIM cards. This was not mention in the description"

"Apple",1,"After less than 60 days stopped working. Stuck on the Apple logo then turns off."
"Apple",5,"The phone is awesome. I had a 4 but I lost it. So this was a replacement. I may get my daughter the same one or the 5s if it's not too expensive."
"Apple",4,"As advertised"

"Apple",1,"It is not unlocked, i love my virgin mobile iphone and it took a dive the last week so i got this as a replacement because in the details it said it was both gms and cdmc compatible. It is locked into verizon and i now have to spend more money on a prepaid contract that doesnt even work for me which is a big strain on my budget. Cant afford to return and can't wait for a new phone, very dissapointed."
"Apple",5,"Good"
"Apple",1,"Received the phone on the date promised and looked like a brand new phone. It wasn't until activating service with a carrier and attempting to transfer contacts from my old iPhone to this new one that we realized the wifi could not be enabled from setting or from the main screen. I have never seen an iPhone that had the wifi setting locked. Can't use it...it's on its way back."
"Apple",5,"old android died, found this as a great deal and perfect condition when I received it. Hooked up with my Straight talk service with no problem"

"Apple",5,"Very good item thanks amazon, your are wonderful"
"Apple",5,"great"
"Apple",5,"To my relief my phone worked fine. Ironically I could not activate on Verizon as a prepaid phone but it worked fine with Tracfone. I do not have any battery issues. This is just a backup phone anyway. It is not being used as a primary phone. I use it while I travel so I don't risk losing the more expensive version of this phone"
"Apple",5,"Mines was white i like everthing but kinda lags sum times but still gud"
"Apple",5,"The product arrived promptly. There was no problem with switching data. I'm very pleased with this purchase."
"Apple",5,"Pretty much brand new 0 scratches Def buy"

"Apple",1,"This phone was locked I buy it as unlock, please respond this to me so I discuses with you"

"Apple",5,"Just received it. Completely awesome!"
"Apple",1,"This phone worked great....until I went to purchase service from a no contract company, and they informed me that this phone was not on their list of unlocked phones. It's stuck on a Verizon Pre-Paid plan. My advice, keep looking."
"Apple",5,"Perfect!!!"
"Apple",5,"Product looked and functioned like brand new, arrived quickly, great price."
"Apple",5,"satisfied might purchase gift again"
"Apple",4,"i got really good piece,"
"Apple",5,"The phone looks great and was well packaged. At first I was concerned that the phone was not fully unlocked because it was a verizon phone but everything works great.

"Apple",1,"Doesn't come on a box dosnt have a charger"

"Apple",1,"WIFI did not work and battery could only keep a charge for a small portion of the day. I returned the item."
"Apple",5,"works great and looks like new. thanks!!"
"Apple",4,"On the amazon site, it listed it as a new phone rather than refurbished. Although I wouldn't expect a new phone that is so dated, it should have been listed as refurbished. The phone itself is fine and works well."
"Apple",5,"Works great."
"Apple",5,"Came on time loved it looks even bigger than expected...having turned it on as yet but I'm blown over thought it would have looked bad....only thing I wish it came with the headphone and manual that wud a have been a plus buuuuttttt love love love my new iPhone thanks amazon love yah......."
"Apple",5,"Worth and full functional."
"Apple",5,"This device works in Venezuela, is unlocked, has no box but is a new device, the charger and the cable is very cheap and low quality."
"Apple",2,"It would in the area where I live."
"Apple",3,"Volume no good cheap"
"Apple",5,"The iphone 4S was in pristine condition even though the description may not claim so. Also it was unlocked and I checked to see that it worked in AT&T. I sent the phone to India for use on the GSM network over there. I am very happy with the purchase. Highly recommended for the price. I paid $85 in July 2016."
"Apple",2,"Doesn't have enough space. I only have about 30 pictures and it won't let me take anymore. Also have to delete texts constantly. I haven't downloaded any apps."
"Apple",5,"iPhone looks and works very good.Sorry that no headphones. The seller is comunicatible."
"Apple",1,"The Battery is not lasting for more than two hours"
"Apple",5,"Everything came as ordered and worked great"
"Apple",1,"It was on the black list. I found that disrespectfull."
"Apple",1,"This iPhone only works using the speakerphone. It is a rebuilt /unlocked phone. Very disappointing purchase. I will return it as soon as possible."
"Apple",4,"Is in perfect condition and is unlocked. all ports work well. It is just as fast as my other iPhone 4s was and can download the current iSO. only problem is that the phone gets really hot really quickly and the battery seems to run out a little faster than normal. comes in a fancy box with a clear top and a charger."
"Apple",5,"Working great. Looks like new."
"Apple",3,"It came on time was happy about it but the charger was not the right one sad can't use it. The surface looks good no scratches but the speaker is not working well when making a call ."
"Apple",2,"battery drained too fast everytime, had to return it."
"Apple",5,"The telephone is in exquisite condition. Also everything is wonderful in regards to the performance of the telephone. Should the need occur in the future...there will not be any hesitation for me to purchase another telephone by using Amazon.com."
"Apple",2,"The phone is good but you sent me the wrong charger.I had to buy another one"
"Apple",5,"In great condition. It came with charger. I have had no problems with the phone."
"Apple",5,"Excellent Product"
"Apple",1,"it wasn't unlocked it was Verizon"
"Apple",1,"Phone not unlock"
"Apple",4,"nice product! delivered in the time!"
"Apple",5,"Good job ."
"Apple",1,"Though the product is good but the battery worked pathetic. I had to charge the phone three times a day. If a phone is factory refurbished, then don't they check the battery quality? Anyway, I returned the product in a week."
"Apple",1,"DO NOT BUY THIS PHONE. IT DOESN'T WORK WITH VERIZON OR A&T. Had to return it."
"Apple",5,"Great"
"Apple",5,"Sometimes one can be a little skeptical when purchasing a refurbished iphone. I had 2 positive experience with iphone I bought from this company. The iphone has been working flawlessly."
"Apple",5,"Excellent phone, looks and works like new."
"Apple",5,"I love this phone. I think that, besides the functionality, I really like how this sturdy this phone is---with just the right amount of weight to it. If something happens to my phone, I will buy this model again."
"Apple",5,"all fine."
"Apple",5,"Products is as picture, love it"
"Apple",5,"Fine"
"Apple",1,"Bad product bad battery life"
"Apple",4,"I love it a lot! The iPhone 4/4S is my favorite designed Apple phone yet. I love everything about it despite not being able to upgrade passed IOS 9.3."
"Apple",5,"works great and no problems with it and I have used it for last several months no problems."
"Apple",1,"If I could I would give it no stars... the phone came and within a few weeks I had time to boot it up and change phones from my old one the this one... it was a mistake to change it before I checked the battery. From the beginning the battery didn't hold a charge very long and it took a long time to recharge... Now within 3 hours after it charged it was dead. I didn't use it once... Now it is trying to charge for 3 hours now and it is still in the red. I will take it to the Apple store to verify a dead battery.. I have sent the seller 2 letters with no responce."
"Apple",2,"Frequent crashes! Not reliable with catching available wifi!"
"Apple",5,"Unlocked as described. Connected to t-mobile without issue."
"Apple",4,"Good"
"Apple",5,"unlocked and everything is good about this device. Recommended"
"Apple",5,"We like the product!! So far she has had no problems."
"Apple",1,"It's not good..it's hanging...Seems like software is too slow"
"Apple",4,"very good"
"Apple",5,"Absolutely wonderful!"
"Apple",3,"The iPhone is working ok. But when i recieved the item, have not box and charger cable and headphone. Only wall charger :("
"Apple",5,"Good"
"Apple",4,"It came exactly when they said it would and the phone looks brand new. So far, the only problem I've had with it is that it froze on me once, but other than that I would definitely recommend this product to a friend."
"Apple",5,"Great condition looks brand new"
"Apple",1,"Was locked to Verizon Useless for me."
"Apple",5,"Phone came in awesome condition with no scratches or dents in it. Battery life was amazing as well! I highly recommend you get this phone! This phone comes already with ios 9. Includes with- Refurbished Unlocked iPhone 4S with built in iCloud, Charging cable with plugThis was a good deal and no other price can beat this!"
"Apple",5,"It's been a month and so far the phone is doing very good."
"Apple",1,"DO NOT BUY THIS IPHONE !I've had it for two weeks and is a piece of junk:-The audio does not work most of the time (especially when using headphones).-It does not connect to Wi-Fi at times.-Safari app crashes constantly.-Battery runs out quickly once it reaches 50 %. Do not buy it. Be smart and buy a new one. I am returning this piece of junk."
"Apple",4,"great starter phone for an 11 year old."
"Apple",5,"All was perfect"
"Apple",4,"The phone was ina good package and works well. Just make sure to configure everything correctly."
"Apple",1,"Was supposed to be gsm unlocked phone, turns out it was for sprint. So it doesn't work for what i need, eventhough it stated it was for those networks in the description!!!!"
"Apple",5,"Perfect condition !!!!"
"Apple",3,"I have purchased two. One worked well. The other kept freezing."
"Apple",5,"Excellent, Im venezuela, 3G Movistar and Ios 9.2 very nice"
"Apple",3,"Hello! I am not fully satisfied with this items. one of the phone Home button is difficult to operate. In addition to this any of these phone not complete set.I didn't get earphone(ear plug) for any of them. Do you think , it is acceptable?"
"Apple",1,"Got a side scratched product with a replaced back-case. It is a Verizon unlocked device and has so far functioned quite well. Not exactly new-looking and new-functioning. I guess refurbished comes with it's own descriptions.UPDATE: 1 month using the phone and just 2 days done with my return window. The phone has started dying out on battery. I would recommend you run diagnostics through some app immediately after you get this or this is a piece of junk packed in a new clothes."
"Apple",1,"Do Not BUY!!!NOT UNLOCKED. Why would Amazon even put up with this?"
"Apple",5,"gooooood"
"Apple",1,"no sim card...weak"
"Apple",1,"It has glitches"
"Apple",1,"It has line in the screen, at times I can't see anything"
"Apple",5,"It's a like new product! Perfect!"
"Apple",1,"While the phone was unlocked, it is not capable of getting a wi-fi signal which means it is constantly using my data plan. Wish I hadn't bought this."
"Apple",1,"Llego well but with the default screen calls chokes and reheated too when charging the battery would give me warranty then could not make the claim before because just a week ago I get the product because I am from Venezuela and slow as I can solve this problem?"
"Apple",1,"I bought the iphone 4s two months ago and no longer works so useless that is cheap if not hard so I'm very upset with my purchase"
"Apple",5,"Seemed just like new. Works fine and a great value! Check here first if you need a new phone!"
"Apple",4,"Okay.. but looks some costly"
"Apple",5,"Extremely pleased"
"Apple",5,"I recently purchased this phone as a birthday present for my son. I had this phone back when it was first released by Apple and had no issues with it. This phone was refurbished and came in looking brand new. The only difference was the fact that it came in a plain box and with no headphone. It did include the charger and cable however. He has been using the phone now for a few weeks and it has worked flawlessly. If you are looking to buy a phone outright, I would definitely opt for a refurbished model. I buy many items that have been on the market for a while refurbished and have never had any problems with operation or aesthetics of them."
"Apple",3,"Phones appear to be in good condition. Not sure about them being new and the after market accessories are very cheap. The USB cable came apart while charging the first time. Reported to customer service via email but have yet to hear back so I just went to find my own replacement Hopefully the phones hold up longer than the charger...."
"Apple",4,"its good, exactly what is pictured"
"Apple",4,"Everything was fine."
"Apple",1,"not buying! It does not work: does not play audio from videos or ring when they call, no charge! and I am now in Colombia and I can not return it! And Amazon is not responding!"
"Apple",5,"Excelent!!"
"Apple",1,"Crappy phone I will not buy anther certified refurbished cell phone."
"Apple",1,"Mobile is not working as expected .Middle button and over all it too slow.."
"Apple",1,"Phone was not unlocked.I was referred to Apple. Apple said, 2 service techs, the phone was still locked to the Cloud. The prices quoted to have device unlocked in the $50 to $200 range. With no guarantee of success.Due to circumstances, the phone was a gift to someone out of the country, I am out the money."
"Apple",1,"Such a worst experience with this buy. This phone is not unlocked and battery is draining out like anything. Keep away from this dealer.I bought another 4s unlocked from lukki_lukki dealer and it's unlocked and in perfect shape.Returning this! !"
"Apple",5,"This is an excellent product. It is just like new, but not as costly. I love it."
"Apple",5,"very good"
"Apple",4,"Nice first phone for a 13 year old. In good working condition. Just a few minor scratches."
"Apple",5,"As said in the description. Perfect condition. Very much satisfied. Thank you"
"Apple",5,"perfect phone"
"Apple",5,"Works real good"
"Apple",5,"Excellent product. No signs of usage. In 100% perfect condition. Does not come with original charger. No headphones also."
"Apple",5,"This is so much better than my old 4s. It upgraded seamlessly to os9 and works perfectly."
"Apple",3,"Sending it back. Apps can not download as this phone can only take up to ios 7, and all the new apps are now using ios 9"
"Apple",5,"The phone works great, I'm just not an iPhone person."
"Apple",5,"Lasted for around 27 days now it won't hold a charge. I loved it when it first game updated it to ios 9.1.2 and it screwed me over not even a month what it. I don't even know what to do.EDIT: Product works. It was just the power brick that came with it. It no longer works. I do have another power brick and the phone does hold a charge."
"Apple",5,"Works like a brand new phone. Works great."
"Apple",3,"Although this did not come with original accessories as stated, knock off charger and no headphones which were include in the original accessories of the iphone 4, the phone seems to work fine for my teenager, the exterior is in excellent shape. Will update when I take it to our carrier."
"Apple",5,"it was in great condition, and received it just as they stated"
"Apple",3,"I've got to be honest, i was a little leary about this product. I ordered it THEN looked at the reviews, boy were they unappealing to read. I was super nervous about what i had just ordered, but to my surprise, it was just fine. Yes, the phone is unlocked, but the box it came in said it would not work for any sprint or sprint affiliated carrier, so that was confusing. The battery is just as everybody says, discharges super fast and turns off when its around 20%. Phone looked brand new, no scratches. Powered right up and put my sim card in, service kicked right in. Overall, not bad."
"Apple",1,"We receive without all the accessories and the charge doesn`t complete. You are selling a bad product."
"Apple",5,"Very good"
"Apple",5,"All ok"
"Apple",4,"The battery is not good. It become low very fast."
"Apple",4,"Not installed at the factory."
"Apple",4,"It looks brand-new, no visual flaws or scars, functions well. No complains yet."
"Apple",5,"Good"
"Apple",4,"Expectations exceeded !Thanks!"
"Apple",1,"This phone did not maintain its charge more than 2 hours and after a month it died never to turn on again."
"Apple",1,"I bought the phone knowing that it was refurbished. I did not look new. The glass was possibly replaced but the sides of the phone were worn, possibly from a case it was in.The phone worked for about three weeks before it crashed. Would not charge, and would not turn on. I took it to Apple and they told me that the battery only lasts 3000 cycles and that it had not been replaced on the phone. It would cost $80. to replace it!This phone is junk and was not correctly refurbished. Save your self the trouble I had, and DO NOT BUY IT!"
"Apple",5,"It's OK"
"Apple",1,"The phone was in perfect shape as far as the appearance. Once I got it activated I had to update the iOS to be able to use iTunes and the Apple Store. The phone worked fast until I started taking pictures and downloaded a few apps. It uses more data than any other phone I've ever used. It usually takes me a month and a half to run out of 2gb of data but with this phone it took two weeks. I have even turned off a lot of applications from running in the background. The absolute worst thing about it is that the battery life with minimum usage typically last me 2 hours. God forbid I make one five minute phone call, it drains the battery down completely within five minutes. I usually have to use it plugged into the charger. It has features that I love but I really don't believe I will keep this phone just because of the consistent low storage warning, low battery life, and slow system. I wanted to return it but didn't know how."
"Apple",1,"Good evening I'm just receiving this iPhone and it's a Verizon iPhone and it's locked.. I need your help to return this item and buy the unlocked cell..."
"Apple",2,"When I received this phone I was very impressed by how well the outside of the phone looked. It looked new. Unfortunately when I turned it on there were a few very faint but noticible yellow lines going down the screen. I returned it because I was nervous that this could become a major issue in the future."
"Apple",1,"This phone is not unlock to any network I purchase now I have to pay to get it unlock"
"Apple",5,"I actually am very happy with it, I got it for my little sister, who really wanted it.I was iffy at first but it works well and it looks great. Will be adding pictures later."
"Apple",5,"I received my order with 100% satisfaction. Thank you very much. Rafael González"
"Apple",3,"Phone was in amazing condition!! is unlocked but WILL NOT work with Verizon. It is a GSM phone which means only services like T-Mobile and AT&T will be able to activate it"
"Apple",5,"Item as described, fast shipping, excellent customer service. Highly recommend!"
"Apple",1,"wrest phone"
"Apple",1,"the iphone came with the power/ sleep button bad so i had to paid 6$ to fix it and also the charger came wrong is ther charger of iphone 5s"
"Apple",5,"This was a great buy for me."
"Apple",5,"Genuine new iphone 4s- packaging, charger , earphone not sure but the phone is absolutely new and works great. Great audio clarity, battery performance so far(10-15 days usage only so far). Is unlocked and work like charm with unlocked gsm sim. Great purchase very happy"
"Apple",5,"Great phone for the price"
"Apple",1,"Wasn't unlocked like it said it was.... Don't buy this. It's a waste of money.."
"Apple",4,"Its been 2-3 months...I feel the best deal I got and perfectly serving the purpose...no issues till date..."
"Apple",5,"i love this phone i love the size and the strength definitely my everyday device i love it"
"Apple",1,"I bought 2 iphones..one was ok..the other was not unlocked, i sended it to my country and it doesn't work..so now what?i lost my 💰?..because i can't see any option to return the phone"
"Apple",4,"The phone was, contrary to my fears, actually unlocked! I was able to put in my SIM card immediately. The charger, however, was not made by Apple, and the end of the rubber cable was frayed and already disconnected."
"Apple",5,"Good product!!"
"Apple",1,"This is not as advertised. Tried to buy and load a SIM card at a cell phone service provider in Vietnam. Could not get it to work . Do not buy this phone"
"Apple",5,"iPhone arrived within 2 days in Excellent condition. I couldn't find the minor scratches mentioned in the description. Unlocked, as promised. Connected to T-Mobile as soon as I inserted my sim card. Activated phone and synced iTunes. I am very pleased with this purchase!"

"Apple",4,"Aside from relatively quickly dying battery, phone is very good. Please be sure to understand your ""carrier/service provider's"" cellular phone requirements before buying this."
"Apple",3,"It's a good quality phone had a problem updating it, but after that works fine, but someone changed the password to my account so might be something but overall okay buy"
"Apple",5,"Good thanks"
"Apple",5,"I have always been happy with Amazon...."
"Apple",5,"Excelente"
"Apple",1,"Phone is in very good condition but the battery is completely useless and thus the phone is useless. Even after following every iPhone tip on closing all apps, changing several settings the battery still only lasts a couple of hours without being used for even a single phone call (the battery is drained in about 3 hours even when the phone is not in use) As a longtime iPhone user I know very well about battery problems (I've also owned a 4S like this one before) This battery should have been replaced! For a product with a ""certified refurbished"" label it was definitely not what was expected."
"Apple",5,"Like"
"Apple",5,"Fue un regalo para mu hija, ella esta feliz, ha funcionado perfecto en Venezuela"
"Apple",1,"Phone was NOT unlocked as stated! It was Verizon contract phone! Buyer beware!"

"Apple",1,"Bought this in may sim tray dead after a month boooooooo"
"Apple",1,"Unit looked clean and appears to work just fine. Its the battery I have an issue with. When unit arrived last Tuesday, the battery was rated as Average by the apps called Battery Life which I installed when i booted the unit. Today the battery is already in a Bad state as indicated by the apps. When u refurbish a unit, the battery must be fresh and brand new."
"Apple",5,"solid performance,"
"Apple",3,"Battery life is pretty short... I'd say 3 hours when using the internet the whole time. If I don't use it much it will last through the day. Other than that, it was unlocked and everything seems to work"
"Apple",3,"Great phonebut my speakers don't work, I can't hear anything from it without a headset."
"Apple",5,"Some refurbished phones don't come with a new battery...this one obviously did cause it runs for 3 days without a charge. it has not malfunctioned since i got it 2 months ago and i did get a silicone/hard plastic combo case that saved it twice. great buyI don't need to fall for the phone of the month hype... and make iphone richer just give me one the works well.."
"Apple",1,"not working"
"Apple",2,"sometimes the sound on videos , music & keyboard clicks are just loud static & it won't turn down , not worth more than $100 IF THAT ..."

"Apple",1,"The phone stopped working after less than 30 days. I'm in Argentina and it's impossible to ship items from other countries in here. I guess it's a waste of time and money. Extremely dissapointed of my purchase and don't have any plans to shop again here."

"Apple",3,"The phone have a problem with the earphone to listen to people when you call."
"Apple",4,"I bought this for my husband because his 5 yr old phone finally gave up the ghost. This works well enough. It is a little slow, but that is probably because it is older and refurbished."
"Apple",5,"Because it's an old iPhone, I thought it would be slow but it's actually very good for its current price."
"Apple",5,"I bought it for a friend, and he loves it."

"Apple",5,"So it's been a month since I bought this product for my mom. So far so good, I mean it is an iPhone 4S, you can't really set your expectations too high. Yes, when I received the phone there was a sticker in the back that said that the carrier was Verizon. However, I took it to my Metro store and there was NO PROBLEM connecting it to this carrier."
"Apple",1,"After few days the Wifi and Bluetooth stopped working"
"Apple",2,"At first there were two problems with the product iPhone 4s unlocked I purchased . The WiFi tab was greyed out dim and I can't connect to Internet even I have a sim card with high speed internet and Wi Fi at home. There is no cellular data network tab on the phone to edit the APN. I called Wireless 2 go They told me they had never had this issue before and they were ready to refund me and sent me a label to return the product. After consideration I decided not to return the product. I reset and erased all the the content and network and started activating the iPhone again. It was a hard time! Finally the Wi Fi tab works and the Internet is connected. However when I browsed Google the Wi Fi stopped working and the screen displayed ""could not activate cellular dater network"" . I had to redo everything again. Totally 3 times. Now it is connected to Wi Fi and Internet but I don't know how long this status can maintain. I even dare not to browse Google website on this iphone. I think the shadow of the former carrier is still there even the phone is unlocked. Is there a way to find out the cellular data network tab and APN to solve this problem?Anyway I have to say that this iPhone 4s has a good look and almost no scratches."
"Apple",4,"My wife now has a telephone that she enjoys using. Thank you"
